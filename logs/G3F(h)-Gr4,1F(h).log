2025-12-28 01:29:42.551 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is the first turn for me (player 1). I have no tokens, opponent has 1W,1R,1Blk. No one can purchase yet. Optimal first move is to reserve L1_17 (cost: B1 G1 R1 Blk1, 0pt white bonus), securing it before opponent does. Reserving grants 1 gold token. Next turn, I can take 1B 1G 1R (board has 4B,4G,3R available), then purchase using B,G,R tokens + gold (as Blk), acquiring white bonus immediately. White bonuses are valuable as many higher cards (e.g., L2_54, L3_76 w7->w6, L3_83 w5->w4, etc.) require white. This positions me to buy on turn 2 efficiently, prevents opponent from taking it (they lack B/G), and gold adds flexibility. Alternatives like taking tokens risk opponent reserving it; purchasing impossible now; other cards harder to acquire quickly (e.g., L1_22 requires more turns).

2025-12-28 01:31:05.399 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 2, my second turn. I have 1 GOLD from reserving L1_17 (cost B1 G1 R1 Blk1, white bonus). Plan from last turn holds: take 1B 1G 1R (board has B3 G3 R2 available), gaining exactly the tokens needed plus GOLD (as Blk) to purchase L1_17 next turn, securing white bonus early. White bonuses are critical for high-white-cost cards like L3_76 (W7->W6), L3_83 (W5->W4), L2_54, etc. Current tokens: 1, +3=4 <=10, no returns needed. Opponent has 1W1B1G2R1Blk (6 tokens), can buy L1_21 (R2 Blk1 white bonus) on their next turn, but that's acceptable as it's a basic 0pt bonus; L1_22 (B2 Blk2 white) unavailable to them now. Reserving L1_21 to deny would delay my purchase (extra turns to acquire R2 Blk1 alongside L1_17), yielding no net gain since opponent could pivot to L1_22 with smart token takes. No purchases possible this turn (insufficient tokens). No better tokens (e.g., 2R leaves board R0 but doesn't enable faster buy). Prioritize engine-building efficiency toward 15 points.

Reserved L1_17 (cost B1 G1 R1 Blk1, 0pt white bonus). Exact match: use B1 G1 R1 + GOLD (as Blk1) to purchase immediately, gaining white bonus. White bonuses are crucial for reducing costs on high-white cards like L3_76 (W7->W6), L3_83 (W5->W4), L2_54 (W2->W1), L2_53, L2_57, and face-up L1_22. Opponent has 1 white bonus from L1_21 (R2 Blk1), tokens W1 B1 G1 (total 3), score 0. After purchase, I'll have white:1 bonus, 0 tokens, 0 score. Board tokens ample (W3 B2 G2 R3 Blk4 Gold4). No other purchases possible yet (e.g., L1_6 needs W2 G2, unavailable). Alternatives: Taking tokens (e.g., 1W1Blk1R) builds pile but delays bonus by a turn, risking opponent progress (they could buy L1_22 B2 Blk2 with their W bonus irrelevant, but they have B1, need more). Reserving another (e.g., L1_22 white bonus) unnecessary as board has options, and I'd hold 2 cards. Blind reserve suboptimal. Purchase now secures engine start efficiently toward 15 prestige.

2025-12-28 01:32:47.269 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 4, my fourth turn. Tokens: all 0, bonuses: WHITE:1, score:0. Opponent: tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:1 (total 6), bonuses: WHITE:1, score:0. Opponent can IMMEDIATELY purchase L1_6 on their next turn (cost W2 G2 reduced to W1 G2 by white bonus; they have exactly W1 G2). This would give them BLACK bonus. To deny opponent the black bonus and secure it for myself (black bonuses useful for L2_50 Blk4->3, L2_53 Blk2->1, L3_75 Blk5->4, L3_83 Blk3->2), RESERVE L1_6 now, receiving 1 gold (avail 5). Plan: Next turn (turn 5), take 1 WHITE 1 GREEN 1 RED (board W3 G2 R3 ample), gaining W1 G1 R1 + gold1; purchase L1_6 using W1 G1 + gold(as GREEN); gain BLACK bonus. Opponent then (their turn 4) likely takes 1 BLUE 1 BLACK 1 other (board B3 Blk3), reaching B2 Blk2, purchases L1_22 (white bonus). Result: Opponent WHITE:2; me WHITE:1 BLACK:1 by my turn 5. Balanced, but I diversify bonuses while they stack white. Opponent cannot buy L1_22 currently (short B1 Blk1), nor other L1s (e.g., L1_27 short R1 Blk1; L1_35 short Blk1). No purchases possible for me (0 tokens). Taking tokens fails to deny L1_6. Reserving L1_22 instead denies their future white2 but lets them buy L1_6 black now, and I cannot buy L1_22 in one turn post-reserve (short 1 gem even with gold joker). Reserving L1_6 optimal: denies immediate progress, efficient buy next turn. Post-bonuses, target points: L2_57 (R5 2pt white bonus), L2_50 (2pt), L3_76 (W7->6 with whites), using bonuses/gold.

2025-12-28 01:32:54.551 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Since my previous target L1_6 was reserved by the opponent, I will adjust my strategy. I currently have 2 Green and 1 Red tokens, which exactly matches the cost of L1_5. Purchasing L1_5 provides a Black bonus, which is a key requirement for several high-value cards like L2_50 and L2_53, and moves me closer to the N5 Noble (4 Red, 4 Black). This purchase is efficient as it uses existing resources to build my engine without needing more tokens first.

2025-12-28 01:33:14.853 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 5, my fifth turn. Current tokens: GOLD:1 (total 1). Reserved: L1_6 (cost WHITE:2 GREEN:2 -> effective WHITE:1 GREEN:2 with my WHITE:1 bonus). Plan from previous turn executes perfectly: TAKE 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED (board: W3 G4 R4 ample). Post-take tokens: WHITE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 GOLD:1 (total 4 <=10, no returns). Next turn (turn 6), PURCHASE L1_6 using WHITE:1 GREEN:1 + GOLD (as GREEN), leftover RED:1. Acquire BLACK bonus (0pt). Now bonuses: WHITE:1 BLACK:1, diversifying for key cards (e.g., L2_50 Blk4->3, L2_53 Blk2->1, L3_75 Blk5->4, L3_83 Blk3->2; combined with white for L3_76 W7->6, L3_83 W5->4). Opponent: bonuses WHITE:1 BLACK:1, tokens W1 B1 Blk1 (total 3), score 0. They purchased L1_5 (black bonus) using prior G2 R1, now low on greens/reds. Cannot buy L1_22 (needs B2 Blk1 effective, have B1 Blk1 short B1), L1_26 (short R1), etc. Likely take tokens (cannot 2B as board B3<4). No immediate threats. Cannot purchase now (insufficient tokens for L1_6 or others). Reserving another suboptimal (already 1 reserved, delays black bonus). Taking 2G (possible, board4) gives G2 GOLD1, but cannot buy L1_6 (short W1) or anything (e.g., no low-cost greens). Other takes (e.g., 2R) don't enable buy next turn as efficiently. Post-black, target: L2_57 (R5 2pt white bonus, use leftover R + more), L2_50 (2pt), then L3_76/L3_83 with bonuses/gold/nobles (e.g., N6 3pt needs 3 each W/B/Blk, feasible). Efficient engine toward 15pt while opponent stacks whites less optimally.

2025-12-28 01:33:53.115 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 6, my sixth turn.

Reserved: L1_6 (cost WHITE:2 GREEN:2 -> effective WHITE:1 GREEN:2 with WHITE bonus). Plan executes perfectly: PURCHASE L1_6 using WHITE:1 GREEN:1 + GOLD (as GREEN), leftover RED:1. Acquire BLACK bonus (0pt), now bonuses: WHITE:1 BLACK:1 (matching opponent but with R1 stock). Board tokens ample post-purchase for future takes. Opponent (tokens W1 B2 G1 R1 Blk1, bonuses W1 Blk1) can buy L1_22 (effective B2 Blk1, exact match, gaining 2nd WHITE bonus) or L1_35 (effective W1 G1 Blk1 for red bonus) next turn, but securing my BLACK prevents further denial and enables targets like L2_50 (2pt, effective W1 R1 Blk3 post-bonuses), L2_57 (R5 2pt white bonus, use R1 + takes), L2_53 (1pt, G3 R2 Blk2 -> Blk1), L3_76 (W7->W6), L3_83 (W5->4 B3 R3 Blk3->2). Nobles like N6 (3 W/B/Blk) feasible with bonuses. No face-up purchases possible now (e.g., L1_26 effective W0 B1 R1 Blk2, short B/Blk). Taking tokens (e.g., 1B1Blk1R, board B2 Blk3 R2) builds but delays BLACK bonus, risking opponent snowball (they buy now anyway). Reserving another (e.g., L2_57) suboptimal with 1 reserved limit? No, but delays engine. Purchase now transitions to points efficiently toward 15 prestige while opponent stacks whites.

2025-12-28 01:34:31.525 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 7, my seventh turn. Tokens: RED:1 (total 1). Bonuses: WHITE:1 BLACK:1, score:0. Just purchased L1_6 last turn, leftover RED:1 as planned. Opponent: tokens WHITE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 (total 3), bonuses WHITE:2 BLACK:1, score:0. No immediate purchases possible for either (e.g., L2_50 effective for me W1 R1 Blk3 - short W1 Blk3; for opponent W0 R1 Blk3 - short Blk3; L1_40 W3/2 - short). Board tokens ample (R2 Blk4 etc.). Transition to points: Prioritize high-value accessible cards. L2_50 (2pt BLUE bonus, cost W2 R1 Blk4 -> effective W1 R1 Blk3) is ideal - leverages my R1 and bonuses, purchasable next turn after reserve + targeted take (1W 1Blk 1R: gain W1 Blk1 R1 + existing R1 GOLD1 -> use W1 R1 Blk1 + GOLD as Blk2 for Blk3, leftover R1). Reserving now secures it (receives GOLD1, total tokens R1 GOLD1), denies opponent (they cannot buy immediately post-my-turn even if take 2Blk to Blk2 R1, still short Blk1; they could reserve on their turn 7, but I preempt). Faster than L2_57 (R5 2pt WHITE, harder with R2 board supply <4 for doubles, multi-turn). Better than L2_53 (1pt) or L1_40 (1pt W3). Post-L2_50 (score:2, bonuses W1 Blk1 BLUE:1), enables nobles (N6 3pt near with bonuses) and L3_76 (W7->W6 BLUE bonus 4pt), L3_83 cheaper. Opponent stacks whites but I diversify/access points first toward 15 prestige.

2025-12-28 01:35:27.234 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have identified L1_40 as a high-priority target. It provides 1 prestige point and a RED bonus for a cost of 4 WHITE tokens. Given my current 2 WHITE bonuses (from L1_21 and L1_22), the net cost to me is only 2 WHITE tokens. I currently possess 1 WHITE token, so taking 1 additional WHITE token this turn allows me to purchase L1_40 on my next turn. I will also take 1 RED and 1 BLACK token to build toward the N5 Noble (4 RED, 4 BLACK) and higher-tier RED cards like L2_57 or L2_70. Additionally, taking 1 BLACK token reduces the board supply to 3, preventing my opponent from using the 'take 2' action on BLACK tokens, which they require for their reserved card (L2_50).

2025-12-28 01:36:16.205 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 8, my eighth turn. Tokens: RED:1 GOLD:1 (total 2). Reserved: L2_50 (BLUE bonus 2pt, cost W2 R1 Blk4 → effective W1 R1 Blk3 with W1 Blk1 bonuses). Previous plan slightly off: taking 1W 1Blk 1R yields W1 R2 Blk1 GOLD1 (Blk equiv: Blk1+GOLD=2 <3), so buy requires one more turn, but still best path. Opponent threatens immediate purchase of L1_35 (RED bonus 0pt, eff W0 G1 Blk1 with their W2 Blk1; pay G1 Blk1 from W2 G1 R2 Blk1, leftover W2 R2). Cannot deny (already reserved L2_50, assuming max 1 reserved). No current purchases possible. Optimal: TAKE 1 WHITE 1 BLACK 1 RED (board W2 Blk3 R1 allow, depletes scarce RED to 0 hindering opponent). Post-take: WHITE:1 RED:2 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 5 <=10, no return). Opponent turn 8 likely buys L1_35 (gains RED bonus). My turn 9: board BLACK:2+, take 1 BLACK 1 BLUE 1 GREEN (avail), yielding additional BLACK:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 → total WHITE:1 RED:2 BLACK:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 GOLD:1. Then PURCHASE L2_50 (pay WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 + GOLD as BLACK:3), leftover RED:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1. Gain 2pt + BLUE bonus (score:2, bonuses WHITE:1 BLACK:1 BLUE:1). Enables N6 noble (needs 3W/3B/3Blk bonuses, build toward), L3_76 (W7→W6 BLUE:1? L3_76 BLUE bonus), L3_75 (Blk5→4 BLUE), L3_83 cheaper. Diversified engine races to 15pt faster than opponent's white stack. Alternatives inferior: 2 BLUE useless; blind reserve impossible; other cards slower (L2_57 R5 hard with R0 post; L1_40 W3 slow; L2_53 G3 R2 Blk1 heavy).

With my current 2 WHITE bonuses and 2 WHITE tokens, I meet the cost of 4 WHITE exactly. Buying this card is highly efficient as it grants my first prestige point and continues building my engine. Since there are currently 0 RED tokens on the board, obtaining RED bonuses through card purchases is essential for reaching the N5 Noble (4 RED, 4 BLACK) and high-value level 2 cards like L2_70.

Taking the last BLACK token from the board is a crucial defensive move, as it prevents my opponent from easily acquiring the tokens needed for their reserved card L2_50 (which requires 4 BLACK). Offensively, this move secures the last BLACK token I need to purchase L1_35, which will provide a second RED bonus. The BLUE and GREEN tokens I'm collecting will support future purchases of L1_27 or L2_53, helping me expand my engine toward the N4, N5, or N6 Noble requirements.

2025-12-28 01:37:15.457 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 10, my tenth turn. Tokens: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:2 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 8). Reserved: L2_50 (2pt BLUE bonus, effective cost WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:3 with WHITE:1 BLACK:1 bonuses). Board: WHITE:3 BLUE:2 GREEN:1 RED:0 BLACK:0 GOLD:4. Plan from turn 9 executes perfectly: Previous take (1 BLUE 1 GREEN 1 BLACK) succeeded despite prediction (BLACK was available then, now depleted to 0 post-opponent turn, but I already have BLACK:2 GOLD:1). Now exactly can PURCHASE L2_50: pay WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 + GOLD as BLACK (total BLACK equiv 3), leftovers BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 (total 3). Gain score:2, BLUE:1 bonus (total bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 BLACK:1). Opponent: score:1, bonuses WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:1, tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 (total 7), no reserved. They cannot immediately threaten high-value (e.g., L2_57 R5 eff R4 with RED:1 bonus, have R2 short; L2_70 R6->5 short; L3_76 W7->5 short; N6 needs more bonuses). Post-purchase, my engine enables L3_76 (W7->W6 with WHITE:1, BLUE bonus 4pt, purchasable soon with WHITE takes + gold), L3_75 (W3 G3 R3 Blk5 -> Blk4 with BLACK:1 BLUE:1? Bonuses apply to own colors: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost, but L3_75 has no BLUE cost; still W3->2 R3 Blk4 with bonuses), L3_83 (W5->4 B3 R3 Blk3->2), and N6 (3pt for 3W/3B/3Blk bonuses - now have 1 each, build 2 more). Diversified bonuses (W B Blk Blue) race to 15pt faster (my score 2 vs opp 1, better setup). Cannot/need not take tokens (board lacks RED/BLACK, GREEN:1 BLUE:2 WHITE:3; taking e.g. 1W1B1G adds but delays points). No other purchases possible/reserved secures this. Optimal: buy now.

2025-12-28 01:37:38.196 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am purchasing L1_35 to secure my second RED bonus. This move is highly efficient as my 2 WHITE bonuses fulfill the WHITE cost requirements, and I already possess the 1 GREEN and 2 BLACK tokens needed. Expanding my RED bonuses is a core part of my strategy to reach the N5 Noble (4 RED, 4 BLACK) and to eventually afford high-prestige RED-heavy cards like L2_70. This purchase keeps my engine momentum high while clearing my hand for more token collection next turn.

2025-12-28 01:38:34.650 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 11, my eleventh turn. Tokens: BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 (total 4, BLACK:0 GOLD:0). Bonuses: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:2. No reserved. Just purchased L2_50 last turn as planned. Opponent: tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:2 BLACK:1 (total 5), bonuses WHITE:2 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:1. Board: WHITE:4 BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:3 GOLD:5. No immediate purchases for me (e.g., L1_3 eff W1 B1 R1 short W1; L1_26 eff R1 Blk1 short Blk1; L1_27 eff R2 Blk1 short R1 Blk1). Opponent major threat: on their turn 11, take 1 RED 1 BLACK 1 WHITE (board allows), gaining R3 B1+ G1 Blk2 W1 total, then PURCHASE L2_57 (2pt WHITE bonus, cost R5 eff R3 with RED:2 bonus), paying R3, leftover etc., score to 3 with WHITE:3 bonus. To prevent: deplete RED to 0 by taking it myself. Optimal: TAKE 1 WHITE 1 RED 1 BLACK (board W4 R1 Blk3 ample; WHITE for L3_76 W6 eff, BLACK versatile for N6/L3_75 denial/depletion). Post-take: WHITE:1 BLUE:1+ GREEN:1 RED:2 BLACK:1 (total 7 <=10, no return). Opponent cannot reach R3 (their R2, board R0, cannot take 2R). They might buy L1_27 (eff B1 R0 Blk1 after their take) for GREEN bonus 0pt, minor. My turn 12: PURCHASE L1_3 (0pt BLACK bonus, cost W2 B2 R1 eff W1 B1 R1 with bonuses; pay WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:1, leftover GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1). Gain BLACK:2 bonus (total W1 B1 Blk2), score:2. Enables progress to N6 (3pt needs 3W/3B/3Blk, now closer on Blk) or L3_76 (W7 eff W6, take whites). Post-buy tokens low (4), next take/build towards 4pt L3_76 or reserve L3_75/L3_83. Denial prevents opponent score3 snowball, my diversified engine (now +Blk2) races to 15pt faster (projected path: +0pt bonus buy, then L3_76 4pt, noble 3pt, etc. vs opp stalled). Alternatives inferior: reserve L2_57 secures 2pt/denies but R5 slow/RED low supply, lets opp other buys; reserve L3_76 great 4pt but lets opp L2_57 now; take 2 WHITE (possible) builds W but leaves RED1, opp buys L2_57; other takes fail denial.

2025-12-28 01:39:08.012 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token. This move is strategically aligned with multiple objectives: First, it moves me closer to Noble N6 (3 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 3 BLACK) and Noble N5 (4 RED, 4 BLACK). Second, it specifically prepares me to purchase L1_3 next turn, which provides a BLACK bonus for a net cost of only 2 BLUE tokens (given my current WHITE and RED bonuses). Third, it builds toward the high-value Level 2 and Level 3 cards like L2_54 (1 point) or L3_76 (4 points), both of which require WHITE and BLUE resources. Finally, taking tokens from the board (where BLUE and BLACK are now low) potentially limits my opponent's options for their next turn.

2025-12-28 01:39:27.240 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 12, my twelfth turn. Tokens: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:2 BLACK:1 (total 6). Bonuses: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:2. No reserved. Previous turn 11 take 1W 1R 1Blk executed (board now RED:0 as planned, denying opponent L2_57). Opponent: tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:2 GREEN:1 RED:2 BLACK:2 (total 8), bonuses WHITE:2 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:1. They can buy low L1s like L1_3/L1_27/L1_26 for bonuses (e.g., L1_3 eff W0 B2 R0 for them, gain BLACK:2), but no points threat (L2_57 R5 eff R3, have R2 short1; board RED:0 prevents more). Optimal: Execute plan - PURCHASE L1_3 (0pt BLACK bonus, cost W2 B2 R1 eff W1 B1 R1 with WHITE:1 BLUE:1 bonuses). Pay exactly WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:1, leftover GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 (total 3). Gain BLACK:2 total bonuses (now WHITE:1 BLUE:1 BLACK:2). Enables symmetric progress to N6 noble (3pt requires 3W/3B/3Blk bonuses; now 1/1/2, need 2W/2B/1Blk more cards). Also reduces L3_75 Blk5→3 eff (BLACK:2), L3_83 Blk3→1; supports L3_76 W7→6 (take whites next). My score:2 vs opp:1, superior diversified engine (W/Blu/Blk) races to 15pt (projected: post-buy, turn13 take 1W1B1Blk/GOLD reserve? → buy L1_27/26 for GREEN? or toward L3_76/noble builders; opp stalled on R/W stack). Alternatives inferior: Buy L1_27/26/30 (GREEN bonus less useful than BLACK for N6/L3s); take tokens (e.g., 1W1B1G, board W2 B1 G2 allows, but delays bonus build/points); reserve L3_76 (4pt W6 slow multi-turn, gets GOLD but opp buys bonuses meantime). No other purchases (L2s/L3s unaffordable). Prioritize bonus engine toward noble + L3_76 for 15pt efficiency.

My primary targets are L2_57 (2 prestige points) and L2_54 (1 prestige point). For L2_57, which costs 5 RED, my 2 RED bonuses plus the 3 RED tokens I will possess (2 starting + 1 taken) will meet the requirement. For L2_54, which costs 2 WHITE, 3 BLUE, and 3 RED, my 2 WHITE bonuses, 3 BLUE tokens, and 1 RED token will satisfy the net requirement. Since taking 3 tokens brings my total to 11, I will return 1 GREEN token, as it is the least necessary for these immediate scoring opportunities. This move transitions my focus from engine building to securing the points needed to reach 15.

Bonuses: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 BLACK:2, score:2. No reserved. Previous plan executed: bought L1_3, bonuses now ideal for N6 (have W1 B1 Blk2, need 2W 2B 1Blk more) and L3_76 (W7 eff W6). Board: W2 B1 G3 R0 Blk1 G5. Opponent at max 10 tokens: W2 B3 R3 Blk2, bonuses W2 R2 Blk1, score:1. Major threat: opponent can PURCHASE L2_57 (2pt WHITE bonus, R5 eff R3 with R2 bonus; pay R3 exact from R3). Gains score:3, bonuses W3 - snowball toward L2_70/N5 or more whites. Also can buy L2_54 (1pt WHITE, eff pay B3 R1 from B3 R3). To prevent best threat (2pt), RESERVE L2_57 (exists on board). Receive GOLD:1 (available), post: GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 4 <=10). Opponent cannot buy L2_57, forced to L2_54 (1pt, score:2 W3) or minor L1 GREEN bonuses or reserve. My denial keeps scores tied at 2 (me2 opp2 worst case), superior engine intact. Post-this: turn14 take 1W 1B 1G/Blk toward L3_76 whites or L1_14 BLUE bonus (G2 eff pay G2 with upcoming G), or buy cheap if possible; gold joker aids L3_76 W6. Races to N6 (3pt) + L3_76 (4pt) + L3_75/83 (3pt) =12+prev2=14, then noble/win vs opp stalled R/W <15. Alternatives inferior: PURCHASE L1_26 (GREEN bonus eff pay R1 exact, but 0pt useless for N6/L3_76/L3_75; opp buys L2_57 to 3pt); TAKE 1W1B1Blk (depletes but opp still buys L2_57 R-cost; delays engine); reserve L3_76 (great 4pt for me, but opp buys L2_57 to 3pt ahead); blind reserve risks junk. Denial + gold prioritizes efficiency/prevention.

2025-12-28 01:41:33.304 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am transitioning from engine building to point acquisition. My most efficient path to a high score is securing L2_70, which provides 3 prestige points. The card costs 6 RED. I currently have 2 RED bonuses and 3 RED tokens, totaling 5. Since there are 0 RED tokens available on the board, reserving L2_70 is the optimal move because it ensures I receive a GOLD token (acting as the 6th RED) and denies my opponent the ability to take it. Because I am currently at the 10-token limit, taking the GOLD token requires me to return one token; I will return 1 BLUE token as it is the least critical for my immediate targets (L2_70 and Noble N5).

Major threat: opponent will PURCHASE L2_70 next turn (pay RED:3 + GOLD as RED=4 equiv exact), gaining score:4, RED:3 bonus, leftovers WHITE:2 BLUE:2 BLACK:2 (total 6). Cannot prevent reserved card. My counter: accelerate to N6 (3pt needs 3W/3B/3Blk bonuses; now 1/1/2, buy L1_14 for B2 next) + L3_76 (4pt W7 eff W6→W5 post B2? No W bonus affects), L3_71 (3pt BLACK bonus), reserved L2_57 (2pt W2), L3_75/83 (3pt each). Optimal: TAKE 1 WHITE 1 BLUE 1 GREEN (board WHITE:2 BLUE:2 GREEN:3 ample; depletes moderately). Post-take: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 7 <=10, no returns).

Vs opp score4 R/W heavy (N5 needs 4R/4Blk bonuses, they R3 Blk1 short). Diversified engine races past despite opp jump. Alternatives inferior: PURCHASE L1_26 (eff RED:1 pay RED:1 exact, +GREEN:1 0pt; minor denial but GREEN suboptimal vs N6, delays tokens/engine by one turn); TAKE 1W1B1BLACK (BLACK board1 depletes but GREEN:1 delays L1_14); TAKE 1B1G1Blk (no WHITE for L3_76); cannot purchase points/reserve more (already reserved L2_57 key). Token take builds multiple paths efficiently.

The cost of the card is 6 RED. Currently, I have 2 RED bonuses, 3 RED tokens, and 1 GOLD token, totaling exactly 6. This move is highly efficient as it turns my existing resources into points immediately while freeing up space in my token inventory (reducing my total from 10 to 6). Additionally, the RED bonus from L2_70 brings me one step closer to the N5 Noble (4 RED, 4 BLACK).

Tokens: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 5). Bonuses: WHITE:1 BLUE:2 BLACK:2, score:2. Reserved: L2_57 (2pt WHITE, RED:5 eff RED:5). Previous plan executed: bought L1_14, now symmetric bonuses W1 B2 Blk2 toward N6 (need W+2 B+1 Blk+1). Board: W1 B1 G3 R2 Blk0 GOLD4. Opponent: tokens W2 B2 G1 R1 Blk3 (total 9), bonuses W2 R3 Blk1, score:4. Major threat: opponent PURCHASE L2_55 (2pt WHITE bonus, cost G1 R4 Blk2 eff G1 R1 Blk1 with R3 Blk1 bonuses; pay exact G1 R1 Blk1 from tokens). Gains score:6, W3 bonus - massive snowball (W3 aids L3_76 eff W4 for them, N5 closer with R3 Blk1→Blk2? No, but points lead 6-2 dangerous). Cannot deplete their G/R/Blk tokens. Optimal: RESERVE L2_55 (visible on board) to deny completely. Receive GOLD:1 (avail4), post: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:2 (total 6 <=10). Now two reserved: L2_57 + L2_55 (both WHITE bonuses → W3 total post-buys, perfect for N6 W3 + L3_76 W7 eff W4). Opponent forced to minor L1 GREEN bonuses (0pt, suboptimal for R/W/Blk stack), take limited (9 tokens, board low B1 W1 etc.), or reserve other (e.g. L3_76, but slow). My path accelerates: turn17 take e.g. 1G 1R +? (board post-opp), build RED for L2_57 (R1+GOLD2=3 equiv, need R2 more → take 2R if avail or 1R/gold), buy L2_57 (+2pt W2 score4), buy L2_55 (G1 R4 eff G1 R4-? B? with bonuses; need G/RED buildup, +2pt W3 score6), L3_76 4pt (W7 eff W4-5 score10-11), N6 3pt (auto? with W3 B2+? Blk2+? Wait need B3 Blk3, have B2 Blk2, need one more each - perhaps L3_71 later Blk3pt), L3_71/75 3pt each →15+ win. Vs opp max ~4+ minor + maybe L2_54/68 slow <15. Denial prevents opp 6pt lead, secures key WHITE engine cards for efficiency. Alternatives inferior: TAKE 1W1B1G/R (depletes board W0/B0 but opp still buys L2_55 with tokens to 6pt; no denial, my tokens to 8 but score gap widens); PURCHASE L1_26/L1_29 (0pt G bonus eff pay R1/W1 exact, minor progress but lets opp to 6pt, GREEN suboptimal vs WHITE/N6/L3_76); cannot afford L2_57 (RED5 need 4 equiv, have 2); reserve L3_76 (4pt great W6→5, but lets opp L2_55 to 6pt ahead); blind reserve risks poor card. Prioritize denial + secure high-value WHITE card/engine builder.

2025-12-28 01:44:57.065 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am targeting the L3_83 card, which provides 3 prestige points. Based on my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 3 RED, 1 BLACK), the net cost for L3_83 is 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE, and 2 BLACK tokens. I currently have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, and 3 BLACK tokens. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN token from the board, I will reach the requirement of 3 WHITE and 3 BLUE tokens. This action brings my total token count to 12, so I will return 1 GREEN and 1 RED token. I am returning the RED token because my 3 RED bonuses already satisfy the RED cost for L3_83, and the additional GREEN token is the least critical for my immediate goal. This turn perfectly positions me to purchase a 3-point card on my next turn.

Prioritize denial + secure opponent threat (L2_54 buyable next turn exactly) for massive WHITE engine toward N6/L3s efficiency.

I have a strong RED foundation (3 bonuses) and a solid engine starting in WHITE (2 bonuses). My immediate strategic goal is to purchase L2_53, which provides 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus.

To purchase L2_53, which costs 3 GREEN, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK, my current bonuses (1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK) leave a net requirement of 2 GREEN and 1 BLACK tokens. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK token this turn, I will possess 2 GREEN and 2 BLACK tokens, perfectly covering the cost for the next turn while also beginning to accumulate WHITE tokens for a future Level 3 purchase.

Vs opp denied L2_53 (forced minor L1_26 0pt G2 pay Blk1 or take tokens, stays ~7 + slow L2_68/L3 heavy <15). Denial secures massive WHITE engine (W5 cheapens all L3 whites to 0-2), extra GOLD speeds RED equiv accumulation (same timing as taking but +denial + extra card/pts). Alternatives inferior: TAKE 2 RED (board4, post RED:2 Blk1 Gold1 total4; opp buys L2_53 to8pt W3 snowball, my L2_57 delayed same turns but opp +1pt gap widens, no extra card); TAKE 1W1B1R (post W1 B1 R1 Blk1 Gold1 total5, broad but RED1 slow for L2_57/55 vs 2R; opp still8pt); TAKE 1G1R1Blk (Blk1 avail depletes but G minor); PURCHASE L1_xx (all free/cheap GREEN 0pt e.g. L1_26 eff0 pay0, but suboptimal GREEN delays engine); cannot afford reserved/pts yet (RED5 need4 equiv, have1). Prioritize denial + secure opponent threat (buyable exactly) for overwhelming WHITE engine efficiency to overtake opp7.

2025-12-28 01:48:42.773 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am targeting card L2_41, which provides 1 prestige point and a BLACK bonus. This is a strategic move to build my BLACK bonus count, which is currently low (1 bonus) and necessary for high-value cards like L3_81, L3_75, and the N5 Noble (4 RED, 4 BLACK). L2_41 costs 3 WHITE, 2 BLUE, and 2 GREEN. With my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 GREEN) and tokens (1 WHITE, 2 GREEN), I only need 2 BLUE tokens to complete the purchase on my next turn. Since there are 4 BLUE tokens available on the board, taking 2 BLUE tokens is a valid and efficient move. My total token count will rise from 5 to 7, staying well below the 10-token limit.

Reserved: L2_57 (2pt WHITE, RED:5 eff RED:5), L2_55 (2pt WHITE, G1 R4 Blk0 eff Blk2), L2_53 (1pt WHITE, G3 R2 Blk0 eff Blk2). Previous plan executed: reserved L2_53 on turn 19 denying opponent (they couldn't buy it, now have W1 B2 G2 R0 Blk2 total7, score:7). Board: W3 B2 G2 R4 Blk1 GOLD3 ample, RED:4 perfect. Opponent threat: can PURCHASE L2_41 (1pt BLACK, cost W3 B2 G2 eff W1 B2 G1 with W2 G1 bonuses; pay exact W1 B2 G1 from tokens, left G1 Blk2 total3, score:8 Blk2). Minor threat: +1pt +Blk2 aids N5 (R3→4? Blk1→2 short Blk2 more) but low tokens post-buy stalls them; not snowball vs my WHITE engine. Optimal: TAKE 2 RED (valid board R4>=4), post RED:2 BLACK:1 GOLD:2 (total5 <=10). No returns needed. Progresses plan: turn21 TAKE 1R 1B 1G (board post-opp ample), post RED:3 B1 G1 BLACK:1 GOLD:2 (total8), PURCHASE L2_57 (RED:5 pay RED:3 GOLD:2 exact, +2pt WHITE:3 score:5, left B1 G1 Blk1 total3).

Vs opp max 8 + L2_68 2pt (post low tokens, eff W1 Blk3 pay short) + minor/N5 short = <15. Alternatives inferior: RESERVE L2_41 (deny 1pt BLACK, +GOLD3 total4) delays RED buildup by 1 turn (opp buys other minor meanwhile, my engine slows, opp to8 unnecessary); PURCHASE L1_29 (free 0pt GREEN eff W0 B0) minor GREEN suboptimal, delays tokens; TAKE 1W1B1G (broad total6, RED0 slow L2_57); TAKE 1R1B1Blk (RED1 B1 Blk2 total6, but 2R faster); cannot afford buys (L2_57 short3 equiv).

Alternatives inferior: RESERVE L2_68 (deny opp 2pt RED, +GOLD:3 total9) delays L2_57 1 turn (opp takes tokens toward L2_44 G4 etc. minor); now short1 RED equiv post-reserve cannot buy L2_57, forces another take turn risking opp buys meanwhile - unnecessary as opp post-L2_68 stalled G2 only; TAKE_TOKENS e.g. 1W1B1G (but R1 G1 low, total11>10 return3 wasteful, delays buy); cannot afford other buys/reserves better (L2_68 eff W1 Blk3 short; L3_76 W4 short; L1_29 free GREEN minor suboptimal).

My primary target is the Level 3 card L3_81, which awards 4 points and would immediately bring my total to 15. To purchase L3_81 (costing 3 WHITE, 3 RED, 6 BLACK), my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 3 RED, 2 BLACK) require me to spend 1 WHITE token and 4 BLACK tokens. Currently, the board has 3 WHITE and 3 BLACK tokens. This turn, I will take 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, and 1 RED token. This move begins the accumulation of the necessary tokens for L3_81 while keeping my total token count low (3 tokens). Taking the RED token is also a strategic defensive move, as it reduces the board's RED supply to 3, preventing Opponent 1 from taking 2 RED tokens on their next turn, which they need for their reserved cards (L2_55 and L2_53).

By taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, and 1 RED token this turn, I will meet the total WHITE requirement and increase my BLACK token count to 2, leaving me only 2 BLACK tokens away from the win. Taking the RED token is also a strategic defensive play, as Opponent 1 requires several RED tokens to complete their reserved cards (L2_55 and L2_53). My total token count will be 6, which is well within the 10-token limit.

Prioritize plan execution: token take secures immediate setup for L2_55 +2pt WHITE4 exploding to L3_76/N6 path winning 19>opp<20.

2025-12-28 01:58:00.201 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have successfully accumulated the resources necessary to purchase my reserved card, L3_81. This card provides 4 prestige points, which will bring my total score from 11 to 15, meeting the victory condition. The cost of L3_81 is 3 WHITE, 3 RED, and 6 BLACK. After accounting for my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 3 RED, 2 BLACK), the net cost is 1 WHITE and 4 BLACK. I currently possess 3 WHITE tokens, 3 BLACK tokens, and 1 GOLD token, which allows me to cover the requirement exactly (using the GOLD token as the fourth BLACK token).

2025-12-28 01:58:44.145 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 28, my twenty-eighth turn. Tokens: WHITE:1 BLUE:3 GREEN:2 RED:2 BLACK:0 GOLD:0 (total 8). Bonuses: WHITE:3 BLUE:2 RED:1 BLACK:3, score:9. Reserved: L2_55 (2pt WHITE, eff G1 R3), L2_53 (1pt WHITE, eff G3 R1). Previous plan executed: took 1W1B1R on turn 27 to W1 B3 G2 R2 total8. Opponent: score:15 (reached win threshold, likely bought high-pt card last turn using max tokens), bonuses W3 B1 G1 R3 Blk2, tokens W2 B1 G0 R2 Blk0 total5 (post-buy). Board: W1 B0 G2 R0 Blk4 GOLD5 (low B/R post-opp action). Cannot PURCHASE L2_55 now (need G1 R3, have G2 R2 short R1, no GOLD to substitute). Cannot buy other pt cards: L3_76 eff W4 short W3; L2_56 eff R4 short R2; L2_69 eff Blk2 short Blk2; L2_43/44 G-heavy short G3+; L1s free 0pt GREEN useless. No nobles (N6 short B1). Opponent threats minimal (at 15, but cannot buy L2 pts: L2_56 eff R2 Blk1 short Blk1; L2_69 Blk3 short; L2_43/44 G4+ short G0; likely take/reserve/minor). Optimal: RESERVE_CARD L3_76 (key 4pt BLUE target, eff W4 cheap with W3), receive 1 GOLD (avail5, post total9 W1 B3 G2 R2 GOLD1). Perfectly setups turn29: PURCHASE L2_55 (reserved, pay G1 from G2 + R2 + GOLD1 sub missing R1 exact; post-pay W1 B3 G1 R0 total5, +2pt WHITE:4 score:11). Turn30: TAKE e.g. 1B1G1Blk/2G toward L2_53 G3 R1 / L3_76 W3 eff; Turn31: PURCHASE L3_76 (reserved, eff W3 post WHITE4 pay cheap W? +4pt BLUE:3 score:15, check N6 W4>=3 B3 Blk3 auto +3pt score:18). Accelerates WHITE4/BLUE3/N6 path to 18+ overtaking opp15 efficiently. Alts inferior: TAKE_TOKENS 2Blk (Blk2 total10, R short persists no GOLD bridge); 1W1G1Blk return1B (W2 B2 G3 R2 Blk1 total10 net+2, but R2 short next); TAKE 3 invalid (no 3rd color w/ B0 R0); PURCHASE L1 free (0pt delays); RESERVE L2_56/69/L3_alt (inferior bonuses/pts vs L3_76 BLUE/N6 enabler). RESERVE L3_76 denial-lite +GOLD solves exact shortage, secures engine to 15+ win.
