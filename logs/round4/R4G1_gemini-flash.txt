Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: I am targeting card L1_8 because it is an efficient Level 1 card offering 1 prestige point for only 4 blue tokens. Since there are at least 4 blue tokens available on the board, I will take 2 blue tokens now to work towards that purchase. This also positions me well for L2_52 later, which costs 6 blue and awards 3 points.

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens and no cards. My goal is to build an engine efficiently. I decided to aim for card L1_34, which costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 and provides a RED bonus. By taking two WHITE tokens on this turn, I can on my next turn take one BLUE, one GREEN, and one BLACK token (since all are available on the board), allowing me to purchase L1_34 immediately. This sequence takes only two turns to acquire a card and a bonus, which is efficient. I considered reserving a card, but since I have no tokens, taking tokens first is better for engine building. I also considered other cards, but L1_34 has a low cost and the RED bonus aligns with noble requirements (e.g., N9 requires RED, BLUE, GREEN). Taking two WHITE tokens is valid because WHITE has 4 tokens available, and after taking, my total tokens will be 2, which is under the limit, so no returns are needed.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2}
Reasoning: I am continuing my strategy to acquire L1_8, which costs 4 BLUE tokens and provides 1 prestige point. I currently have 2 BLUE tokens. Since there are only 2 BLUE tokens remaining on the board, I cannot take '2 of the same color'. Instead, I will take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK. This brings my BLUE total to 3, putting me within reach of L1_8 next turn, while also collecting colors that may be useful for other Level 1 cards like L1_27 or L1_18.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 2 WHITE tokens. My goal is to build an engine efficiently by acquiring card L1_34, which costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 and provides a RED bonus. Currently, I have WHITE:2, so I need one BLUE, one GREEN, and one BLACK token to purchase L1_34 on my next turn. Taking these three tokens now is valid because BLUE has 1 token available, GREEN has 3, and BLACK has 3. After taking, my total tokens will be 5 (2 WHITE + 1 BLUE + 1 GREEN + 1 BLACK), which is under the 10-token limit, so no returns are needed. This sequence allows me to purchase L1_34 on my next turn, gaining a RED bonus that aligns with noble requirements like N9 (RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). I considered reserving a card or taking other tokens, but taking these tokens directly supports my planned purchase and engine building.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 3 BLUE tokens and need 1 more to purchase L1_8 (worth 1 prestige point). However, there are 0 BLUE tokens remaining on the board. By reserving L1_8 now, I secure the card from my opponent and receive a GOLD token, which I can use as the 4th BLUE token to purchase the card on my next turn. This is the most efficient path to scoring my first point given the token scarcity on the board.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. I can now purchase card L1_34, which costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. This matches my current tokens exactly. Purchasing L1_34 will give me a RED bonus, which aligns with noble requirements like N9 (RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). Since I can afford this card directly and it advances my engine efficiently, I should purchase it now. Other cards are not affordable with my current tokens, and taking tokens would delay my progress. After purchase, I will have no tokens left but will have a card and a bonus, setting me up for future moves.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens and one purchased card (L1_34) that gives a RED bonus. My goal is to build an efficient engine to reach 15 points, focusing on nobles like N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). Since I have no tokens, I need to take tokens this turn. After evaluating available cards, L1_5 stands out as it requires only 2 GREEN tokens to purchase (due to my RED bonus reducing the RED cost to zero). Taking two GREEN tokens now allows me to purchase L1_5 on the next turn, gaining a BLACK bonus quickly. This two-turn sequence is efficient compared to other cards that require three turns due to multiple token types or colors. While the BLACK bonus may not directly help with available nobles, it accelerates my card acquisition and can reduce costs for future cards like L1_27. The board has 3 GREEN tokens available, so taking two is valid, and my token count will be 2, under the limit, so no returns needed.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 3 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens. My goal is to build my engine efficiently. I currently have one RED bonus from card L1_34, so I want to acquire another card that provides a useful bonus. Card L1_30 on the board offers a RED bonus and costs BLUE:2 and RED:2. With my existing RED bonus, the cost reduces to BLUE:2 and RED:1, requiring only three tokens. I cannot purchase it immediately because I have no tokens, and taking three tokens in one turn would not give me the specific combination needed. Taking two BLUE tokens this turn is valid since BLUE has 4 available, and it sets me up to have two BLUE tokens. Next turn, I can take three tokens including RED, and then purchase L1_30. This approach efficiently progresses my engine by adding another RED bonus, which can reduce costs for future cards with RED requirements. I considered reserving a card or taking other token combinations, but directly taking tokens towards L1_30 is more straightforward and avoids unnecessary delays.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {GRN=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 1 GREEN token, 1 BLACK token, and a BLACK bonus from my previous purchase (L1_8). My immediate goal is to acquire more Level 1 cards to build an engine and move toward higher-point Level 2 cards. Two affordable options are L1_5 (costs 2 GREEN, 1 RED) and L1_18 (costs 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK). By taking 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED token this turn, I will have the exact resources needed to purchase either L1_5 or L1_18 on my next turn, depending on availability. This strategy keeps my options open and utilizes my existing tokens effectively.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 2 BLUE tokens. My goal is to efficiently acquire card L1_30, which costs BLUE:2 and RED:2 and provides a GREEN bonus. With my existing RED bonus from L1_34, the cost reduces to BLUE:2 and RED:1. Since I already have BLUE:2, I only need one RED token to purchase L1_30 on my next turn. However, I must take exactly three different tokens this turn because no color has 4+ tokens available to take two of the same. Taking RED, GREEN, and BLUE tokens is optimal: RED is essential for L1_30, GREEN aligns with the noble N9 (which requires GREEN bonuses) and future purchases like L1_5, and BLUE is scarce (only one left) and useful for reducing costs in upcoming cards. After taking these tokens, I will have BLUE:3, RED:1, and GREEN:1, allowing me to purchase L1_30 next turn. This sets up a sequence to purchase L1_5 afterward, building my engine toward nobles and points efficiently.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I will purchase L1_18 as I have the exact tokens required: 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK (including my 1 BLACK bonus). Since there are currently 0 BLUE tokens available on the board, using my single BLUE token now to acquire a card is highly efficient. This purchase also grants me a WHITE bonus, which is a key requirement for several high-prestige cards like L2_67, L2_68, and L3_82, helping to diversify my engine.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1. I can purchase card L1_30, which costs BLUE:2 and RED:2. With my existing RED bonus from L1_34, the cost reduces to BLUE:2 and RED:1. I have exactly BLUE:3 and RED:1, so I can pay the required tokens. Purchasing L1_30 gives me a GREEN bonus, which aligns with the noble N9 (requiring RED, BLUE, GREEN bonuses) and future cards like L1_5. This move efficiently advances my engine by adding a second bonus without delaying for token acquisition. After purchase, I will have BLUE:1 and GREEN:1 left, which sets up future turns.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase card L1_5 immediately with my current tokens and bonuses. The cost is GREEN:2 and RED:1, but with my GREEN:1 and RED:1 bonuses, the effective cost reduces to GREEN:1. I have exactly one GREEN token, so I can pay for it without needing additional tokens. Purchasing L1_5 gives me a BLACK bonus, which expands my engine and could be useful for future cards like L1_14 or L2_66, and it aligns with my goal of building bonuses for nobles like N9 (which requires RED, BLUE, GREEN). After purchase, I will have one BLUE token left, which can be used towards other purchases. This move is efficient as it uses my existing resources without delay.

The cheapest cards to purchase are L1_14 and L1_27, but L1_14 provides a BLUE bonus, which I lack and is crucial for noble N9 (requiring RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3) and future cost reductions. To purchase L1_14 (effective cost GREEN:1, BLACK:1 with my bonuses), I need GREEN and BLACK tokens. By taking one GREEN, one BLACK, and one BLUE token this turn, I will have BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, allowing me to purchase L1_14 immediately on my next turn. This action efficiently builds my engine by acquiring a new bonus color and sets up future purchases. Taking BLUE also accumulates tokens for cards like L1_23 or L2_52. This avoids delaying my progress and minimizes the risk of losing key cards to the opponent.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can currently purchase L1_14 using my existing tokens (1 GREEN, 1 BLACK) and bonuses (1 GREEN, 1 BLACK). This provides a BLUE bonus, which I currently lack. This diversifies my engine and moves me closer to targeting higher-tier cards like L2_67, which requires BLUE, or working toward the N8 noble (BLUE, WHITE, GREEN requirements).

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. My bonuses are GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I need to build my engine by acquiring new bonuses, particularly BLUE, to work towards nobles like N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). The only card on the board that provides a new bonus is L1_23 (BLUE bonus), but it costs BLUE:3. I currently have only two BLUE tokens, so I need one more BLUE token to purchase it. Since I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens, I must take tokens this turn. I must take exactly three tokens of different colors or two of the same, but only one color (RED) has 4+ tokens available for taking two same. However, taking two RED tokens would not give me the needed BLUE token, so I take three different tokens: one BLUE, one RED, and one GREEN. This gives me BLUE:3, allowing me to purchase L1_23 on my next turn. RED and GREEN tokens are useful for future purchases and align with my noble goals. After taking, I have 7 tokens, so no tokens need to be returned.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have a solid foundation with one bonus each in WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, and BLACK. To further diversify my engine and work toward nobles like N9 and N8, I need a RED bonus and more points. Card L1_35 (RED bonus) is an excellent target; it costs 2 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 2 BLACK. With my current bonuses (1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK), the effective cost is only 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK. By taking 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token this turn, along with 1 BLUE token (taking advantage of its scarcity on the board), I position myself to purchase L1_35 on the next turn. This move ensures I continue building my engine while keeping an eye on high-prestige Level 2 cards like L2_67 or L2_52.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 and bonuses: GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. My strategic goal is to acquire a BLUE bonus to work towards noble N9, which requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses. Currently, no face-up cards on the board offer a BLUE bonus. The affordable cards are L1_27 (GREEN bonus) and L1_23 (WHITE bonus), but purchasing them would not provide the needed BLUE bonus and would only use my existing tokens without advancing my core objective. Therefore, I decide to reserve a card from the LEVEL_1 deck. This action allows me to potentially draw a card with a BLUE bonus while also gaining a gold token, which can be used as any color in future purchases for flexibility. With 7 tokens currently, reserving does not cause token overflow, and I can continue to build my engine in subsequent turns.

Reasoning: I will purchase L1_35 because it allows me to diversify my engine by acquiring my first RED bonus. It costs 2 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 2 BLACK. Given my current bonuses (1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK), the effective cost is only 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token. Since I have 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token in my inventory, I can afford it immediately. Having a bonus in every color (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK) will significantly lower the cost of higher-tier cards and help me progress toward noble tiles like N9 and N8.

Reasoning: I currently have a balanced engine with one bonus of each color. Since BLUE tokens are currently unavailable on the board (0 in the bank), I cannot pursue cards that strictly require additional BLUE tokens for now. Instead, I will continue building my engine by targeting Level 1 cards that I am close to purchasing. Specifically, card L1_6 (BLACK bonus) costs 2 WHITE and 2 GREEN. With my current bonuses (1 WHITE, 1 GREEN), I only need 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN token. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK token this turn, I position myself to purchase L1_6 on my next turn. The additional BLACK token will also be useful for future prestige cards like L2_68 or L2_66. My total token count will be 4, well within the limit of 10.

Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I need to acquire a blue bonus to work towards noble N9, which requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses. Currently, no face-up blue bonus cards are affordable, but L2_52 provides a blue bonus and 3 prestige points. I have three blue tokens and two gold tokens, so I need one more gold token to purchase L2_52. By reserving L2_52, I gain one gold token, giving me three gold tokens. This allows me to purchase L2_52 on my next turn using three blue tokens and three gold tokens (substituting for the missing blue tokens). This action efficiently secures a key card and advances my strategic goal without wasting tokens or risking token overflow.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_52, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have successfully built a balanced engine with one bonus of each color. Currently, card L1_6 (BLACK bonus) is immediately affordable. It costs 2 WHITE and 2 GREEN; with my bonuses (1 WHITE, 1 GREEN), I only need to spend 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN token. This move is efficient because it further develops my engine while preserving my single BLUE token, which is valuable since the board currently has 0 BLUE tokens. Stacking another BLACK bonus also brings me closer to high-prestige Level 2 cards like L2_68 (2 points, 5 BLACK).

Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=3}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 10 tokens, so taking tokens would require returning tokens, which is inefficient and wastes a turn. Therefore, I should purchase a card. My primary strategic goal is to acquire a BLUE bonus to work towards noble N9 (requiring RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses). Currently, I have no BLUE bonus. Among the face-up cards, L1_12 offers a BLUE bonus and is affordable with my current tokens and bonuses. The cost after bonuses is BLUE:1 and GREEN:2, which I can pay with my BLUE:3 and GREEN:2 tokens. Purchasing L1_12 gives me the needed BLUE bonus without using my GOLD tokens, preserving them for future flexibility. After purchase, I will have 7 tokens, allowing me to take tokens in future turns if needed. While L2_52 (reserved) provides a BLUE bonus and 3 points, it would require 3 BLUE and 3 GOLD, depleting my GOLD tokens and reducing my flexibility. Thus, purchasing L1_12 is the most efficient action to advance my engine and noble pursuit.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I will take 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token. This move is strategic for several reasons: 1) It increases my token count to 5, providing more flexibility for future turns without hitting the 10-token limit. 2) It secures one of the few remaining BLACK tokens, which are essential for high-prestige cards like L2_68 (2 points), L3_80 (4 points), and L3_82 (5 points). 3) It takes the last available BLUE token from the board, which is an important resource for engine building and potentially slows down the opponent's progress on BLUE-heavy cards. By taking these tokens, I am positioning myself to purchase L1_22 (WHITE bonus) and L1_3 (BLACK bonus) in the next two turns. This will strengthen my engine, specifically targeting the BLACK and WHITE bonuses required for the highest-value cards on the board, which is the most efficient path to 15 points.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with 7 tokens: BLUE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:3. My bonuses are BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I need to acquire points and build towards noble N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses). I have L2_52 reserved, which provides a BLUE bonus and 3 prestige points. The cost is BLUE:6, but after my BLUE:1 bonus, I need to pay 5 tokens. I can cover this with my BLUE:2 tokens and use 3 GOLD tokens to substitute for the missing 3 BLUE tokens. Purchasing L2_52 gives me an immediate 3-point lead and advances my BLUE bonus to 2, getting me closer to the noble requirement. After purchase, I will have RED:1 and BLACK:1 tokens left, allowing me to take tokens in future turns to purchase my other reserved cards (L1_33 for RED bonus or L1_31 for GREEN bonus) or acquire more tokens for other opportunities. This action avoids token waste and efficiently uses my resources for point gain.

Reasoning: I will purchase L1_22 to strengthen my engine with a second WHITE bonus. This card is highly efficient for me: its cost of 2 BLUE and 2 BLACK is reduced to just 1 BLUE token because of my existing 1 BLUE and 2 BLACK bonuses. Acquiring this card supports a long-term strategy of reaching 15 points through high-prestige cards like L2_68 (2 points, requires 3 WHITE) and L3_82 (5 points, requires 3 WHITE). Additionally, having this second WHITE bonus makes the BLACK-bonus card L1_3 nearly free next turn, further accelerating my engine development.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with 2 tokens (1 RED, 1 BLACK) and bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. My goal is to build towards noble N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). I can purchase L1_37 immediately because it costs BLUE:2 and GREEN:1, which are fully covered by my bonuses. This gives me a RED bonus without spending tokens, increasing my RED bonus to 2. This action is efficient as it advances my bonus count while preserving my tokens for future turns, allowing me to take tokens or purchase other cards later. Purchasing other cards like L1_27 would cost tokens, leaving me with 0 tokens, which is less flexible. Reserving a card is less beneficial since I already have two reserved cards and need to build bonuses directly.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_37]

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_3 (BLACK bonus), which is highly efficient. It costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, and 1 RED. With my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED), the net cost is only 1 BLUE token, which I currently possess. This purchase strengthens my engine to 3 BLACK bonuses. More importantly, it strategically sets up the purchase of L2_68 (2 prestige points) for my next turn. L2_68 costs 3 WHITE and 5 BLACK; after buying L1_3, my bonuses (2 WHITE, 3 BLACK) and remaining tokens (1 WHITE, 2 BLACK) will exactly match that cost. This sequence allows me to gain 2 points quickly without wasting turns taking tokens from the board.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 2 tokens (RED:1, BLACK:1) and bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. My strategic goal is to achieve noble N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses). I currently have RED:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, so I need one more RED, one more BLUE, and two more GREEN bonuses. I have two reserved cards: L1_31 (GREEN bonus, cost RED:3) and L1_33 (RED bonus, cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1). After applying bonuses, L1_31 costs only 1 RED token, which I have. Purchasing L1_31 now gives me an immediate GREEN bonus, increasing my GREEN bonus to 2, and uses my RED token, leaving me with BLACK:1. This action advances my bonus count without wasting tokens and preserves flexibility. On my next turn, I can take tokens to acquire a WHITE token (needed for L1_33) and other colors to purchase L1_33 and continue building towards N9. Purchasing from reserved cards is safer than from the board, as it avoids opponent competition.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with only one BLACK token. I can purchase L1_27 from the board, which gives a GREEN bonus. After applying my bonuses, the cost reduces to only 1 BLACK token, which I have. Purchasing this card advances my GREEN bonus to 3, getting me closer to noble N9 (which requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). After this purchase, I will have no tokens, but I have reserved card L1_33 which I can purchase next turn by taking a WHITE token. This action efficiently uses my current token to gain a needed bonus without wasting resources.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: At this stage in the game, I have a strong engine with 2 WHITE and 3 BLACK bonuses, positioning me well for high-prestige Level 3 cards. My primary targets are L3_80 (4 points), which requires 7 BLACK (effectively 4 tokens), and L3_82 (5 points), which requires 3 WHITE and 7 BLACK (effectively 1 WHITE and 4 BLACK tokens). Taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token is the most efficient and flexible move. It directly accumulates the resources for my main targets while also providing a BLUE token to help with Level 2 cards like L2_67 (2 points) or L2_66 (1 point), should the L3 cards be reserved or purchased by the opponent. This move utilizes my turn fully without hitting the token limit.

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 0 tokens, so I cannot purchase any card. I need to take tokens to enable future purchases. My strategic goal is to qualify for noble N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses) by acquiring one more RED and one more BLUE bonus. I have L1_33 reserved, which provides a RED bonus and requires only a WHITE token after bonuses. I also plan to purchase L1_13 from the board, which provides a BLUE bonus and requires WHITE and BLACK tokens after bonuses. By taking one WHITE, one BLACK, and one GOLD token, I can next turn purchase L1_33 using the WHITE token (or GOLD if needed). Then, with the remaining BLACK and GOLD tokens, I can purchase L1_13 in the subsequent turn, using GOLD to cover the WHITE cost. This sequence efficiently advances my bonus counts and allows me to qualify for N9, gaining 3 points. Taking gold provides flexibility for any future needs. Reserving a card would only give me a gold token without the necessary tokens to purchase immediately, so taking tokens is superior.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: I need to acquire a BLUE bonus to achieve noble N9, which requires BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3 bonuses. I currently have BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, so I need one more BLUE bonus and one more RED bonus. I have L1_33 reserved, which provides a RED bonus, but I need a BLUE bonus. L1_13 on the board offers a BLUE bonus and is affordable after bonuses (costs WHITE:1 and BLACK:1). However, player 0 can purchase L1_13 for free due to their bonuses, so I should reserve it to secure it for myself and prevent opponent access. Reserving also gives me a gold token, which I can use to purchase L1_33 on my next turn by substituting for the WHITE cost. This strategy efficiently uses my turn to block the opponent, gain a gold token, and set up future purchases to complete my noble requirements.

This move is designed to pursue multiple strategic scoring opportunities simultaneously. 1) The BLACK token is a critical resource for my primary targets, the high-prestige Level 3 cards L3_80 (4 points) and L3_82 (5 points). Both require 7 BLACK; with 3 bonuses and 2 BLACK tokens (after this turn), I will be only 2 away from securing these major point boosts. 2) The BLUE token, added to my existing BLUE token and 1 BLUE bonus, will allow me to purchase L2_66 (1 prestige point) for its net cost of 2 BLUE tokens in a future turn. 3) The GREEN token builds toward L2_42 (1 point) or L2_67 (2 points), ensuring I have flexible point-scoring paths if the Level 3 cards are reserved by my opponent. This selection maintains a manageable token count of 6 and follows a clear trajectory toward 15 prestige points.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I need to achieve noble N9, which requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 bonuses. Currently, I have GREEN:3, RED:2, BLUE:2, so I need one more RED bonus and one more BLUE bonus. I have L1_33 reserved, which provides a RED bonus. I can purchase it now using my gold token to cover the WHITE cost, as after bonuses, only the WHITE cost requires a token (other costs are covered by my bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1). This allows me to immediately gain the RED bonus, bringing my RED bonus to 3. After this purchase, I will have no tokens left, but I can take tokens next turn to purchase L1_13 (which provides the BLUE bonus) by acquiring 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token. This action efficiently uses my gold token and advances my strategy without wasting turns, as purchasing from reserved cards avoids opponent competition and secures the needed bonus.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=5}
Reasoning: My primary objective is to secure the high-prestige Level 3 cards L3_82 (5 points) and L3_80 (4 points). Both require a total of 7 BLACK (I have 3 bonuses and 2 tokens, needing 2 more tokens). L3_82 also requires 3 WHITE (I have 2 bonuses and 1 token, which already satisfies the requirement, but taking an extra WHITE provides a safety margin). By taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token this turn, I increase my token count to 9 (W:2, B:3, G:1, R:0, K:3). This keeps me below the limit of 10, positions me to collect the final necessary BLACK token next turn, and maintains my existing BLUE tokens to keep options like L2_67 (2 points) or L2_66 (1 point) viable if the Level 3 cards are contested. This path is more efficient for reaching 15 points than purchasing the lower-value L2_66 immediately.

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 0 tokens and need to achieve noble N9 (requires RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). I currently have bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, so I need one more BLUE bonus. I have reserved card L1_13, which provides a BLUE bonus, and after bonuses, its cost is WHITE:1 and BLACK:1 (since my BLACK:1 bonus reduces the BLACK cost by 1). To purchase L1_13, I need at least 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token. Since I have no tokens, I must take tokens this turn. The board has WHITE:2, BLACK:1, and GREEN:3 available. I will take one WHITE, one BLACK, and one GREEN token. This allows me to have the required tokens for L1_13 on my next turn, after which I can claim noble N9 for 3 points, bringing my total to 6 points. The GREEN token can be used later to purchase point cards like L1_24 if available. Taking tokens now is efficient as it sets up immediate progress toward the noble without wasting turns. Player 0 cannot purchase L1_24 immediately due to insufficient GREEN tokens, so I have time to secure L1_13 first.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=6}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L2_67, which provides 2 prestige points. This is the most efficient move currently available as I have the exact resources required. The card costs 1 WHITE, 4 BLUE, and 2 GREEN. With my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN), the net cost is 3 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens, both of which I have in my inventory. Since BLACK tokens (needed for high-value Level 3 cards) are currently unavailable on the board, securing 2 points immediately is a better strategic move than waiting or taking other tokens. This purchase brings my total score to 5 points.

Reasoning: I have reserved card L1_13, which provides a BLUE bonus. My current bonuses are BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:1, so after applying bonuses, the cost of L1_13 is WHITE:1 and BLACK:1. I currently have WHITE:1 and BLACK:1 tokens, so I can purchase it immediately. Purchasing L1_13 will increase my BLUE bonus to 3, fulfilling the requirement for noble N9 (RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). Claiming noble N9 will grant me 3 points, bringing my total score to 6. This action efficiently uses my existing tokens to secure the noble and advance my strategy without wasting a turn on token collection.

Reasoning: I am taking 1 BLACK, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN token to prepare for purchasing the high-prestige Level 3 card L3_82. Currently, I have 5 prestige points and a resource base consisting of 2 WHITE bonuses, 3 BLACK bonuses, 2 WHITE tokens, and 3 BLACK tokens. This totals 4 WHITE and 6 BLACK resources. Since L3_82 costs 3 WHITE and 7 BLACK, I am exactly one BLACK token away from being able to afford it. By taking the last available BLACK token from the board now, I ensure I can purchase L3_82 on my next turn, bringing my total score to 10 points. The BLUE and GREEN tokens increase my resource flexibility for future turns, potentially contributing towards noble requirements or other Level 2 prestige cards.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=7}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L3_82 to gain 5 prestige points, bringing my total score to 10. The card costs 3 WHITE and 7 BLACK resources. With my current bonuses (2 WHITE, 3 BLACK) and tokens (2 WHITE, 4 BLACK), I can exactly satisfy the net cost of 1 WHITE token and 4 BLACK tokens. This is the most efficient move to reach the 15-point target, as it secures the highest-value card available and capitalizes on my engine before the opponent can catch up.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=1}
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 0 tokens. I can purchase card L1_23 from the board for free because its cost (BLUE:3) is fully covered by my current BLUE bonus of 3. This card provides a WHITE bonus, which progresses my progress towards noble N8 (requires WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3). By purchasing this card without spending tokens, I efficiently use my turn to enhance my bonuses while saving my token acquisition for future turns. This sets me up to take tokens next turn to pursue higher-value cards or nobles. After this purchase, my bonuses will be WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:1, and my score remains at 6 points.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am currently at 10 prestige points and only require 5 more to reach the target of 15. My strategy focuses on acquiring high-value cards that align with my existing engine. The most efficient path is to purchase the Level 3 card L3_80, which offers 4 points for a cost of 7 BLACK resources. With 3 BLACK bonuses, I need 4 supplementary BLACK tokens. There are currently 4 BLACK tokens available on the board, so I will take 2 this turn. This move is efficient and safe, keeping my total token count at 5 (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 BLACK). On subsequent turns, I will collect the remaining 2 BLACK tokens to purchase L3_80, and then aim for a final 1-point card like L1_24 or L2_42 to reach the 15-point goal.

Reasoning: I need to progress towards noble N4 (requires GREEN:4 and BLUE:4) to gain 3 points. Currently, I have BLUE:3 and GREEN:3, so I need one more of each. Purchasing L1_11 gives me a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE to 4, at no token cost due to my bonuses. This also prevents opponent player 0 from purchasing it, as they have the tokens to do so. After this purchase, I can next turn purchase L1_28 (free) to get GREEN:4 and claim N4, reaching 9 points. This strategy efficiently uses my turn to secure bonuses without spending tokens, saving my 1 GREEN token for future point card purchases.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I am currently at 10 points and need 5 more to reach the target. My strategy is to acquire L2_42 (1 point) and L3_80 (4 points). L2_42 requires 3 WHITE, 3 GREEN, and 2 BLACK resources; with my current bonuses (3W, 1G, 3B), I only need 2 GREEN tokens. L3_80 requires 7 BLACK resources, which means 4 tokens in addition to my 3 BLACK bonuses. By taking 1 BLACK, 1 GREEN, and 1 WHITE token this turn, I increase my token counts to 2 WHITE, 2 GREEN, and 3 BLACK. This makes L2_42 affordable on my next turn and positions me to collect the final BLACK tokens needed for L3_80 immediately after. Furthermore, taking a GREEN token denies the opponent the resource they need to fulfill the requirement for noble N4.

After purchasing, my GREEN bonus becomes 4, meeting the requirement for noble N4, which I can claim immediately for 3 points, bringing my total to 9 points.

Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=6}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L2_42 to reach 11 prestige points and secure a critical BLACK bonus. This card costs 3 WHITE, 3 GREEN, and 2 BLACK resources. With my current engine of 3 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 3 BLACK bonuses, the net cost is only 2 GREEN tokens, which I currently have in my inventory. This move is strategically optimal because it increases my total BLACK resources (bonuses + tokens) to 7 (4 bonuses after this purchase and my 3 existing BLACK tokens). This perfectly positions me to purchase the 4-point card L3_80 on my very next turn, which costs exactly 7 BLACK. Completing this two-turn sequence will bring my score to 15, securing the victory before my opponent can close their own point gap.

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 9 points and 1 GREEN token. My bonuses are WHITE:1, BLUE:4, GREEN:4, RED:3, BLACK:1. To reach 15 points, I need to claim nobles or purchase point cards efficiently. Noble N8 requires WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, and I currently have WHITE:1, so I need two more WHITE bonuses. The board has L1_24 available, which provides a WHITE bonus and 1 prestige point. Its cost is GREEN:4, but my GREEN:4 bonus reduces the cost to 0, so I can purchase it for free without spending tokens. This action gives me 1 point and increases my WHITE bonus to 2, moving me closer to N8. After this purchase, my score becomes 10, and I will have WHITE:2. On my next turn, I can purchase L1_21 (which is free and provides a WHITE bonus) to reach WHITE:3 and claim N8 for 3 points, bringing my total to 13. Then I need only 2 more points, which I can pursue by taking tokens to purchase point cards like L2_61 or L3_71. This approach prioritizes point gain and noble acquisition while preventing player 0 from easily claiming N8, as they still need BLUE:2 and GREEN:2 to meet its requirements.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_24]

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=7}
Reasoning: I have reached 11 prestige points and currently possess 4 BLACK bonuses and 3 BLACK tokens, giving me a total of 7 BLACK resources. The Level 3 card L3_80 costs exactly 7 BLACK resources and provides 4 prestige points. By purchasing this card, my total score will reach 15 points, meeting the game's victory objective. This is the most efficient and final move to secure the win this turn.

Turn 27 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I need to reach 15 points to win, but player 0 already has 15 points, so I must maximize my points in this turn. I currently have 10 points and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:4, GREEN:4, RED:3, BLACK:1. Noble N8 requires WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, and I only need one more WHITE bonus to meet this. L1_21 provides a WHITE bonus and 1 prestige point. Its cost is RED:2 and BLACK:1, but with my bonuses, the cost is fully covered (RED:0, BLACK:0), so I can purchase it for free without spending tokens. After purchasing, I gain 1 point, and my WHITE bonus increases to 3, allowing me to claim N8 immediately for 3 points. This gives me a total of 4 points in one turn, bringing my score to 14. Although I fall short of 15 points, this action is the most efficient way to gain points quickly. Since player 0 has already won, I cannot reach 15 on this turn, but purchasing L1_21 is still the optimal move to improve my score as much as possible.
