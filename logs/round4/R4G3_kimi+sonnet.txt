Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: This is the opening move (turn 1) with no tokens or cards for either player. My strategy is to build a bonus engine by targeting cheap Level 1 cards. I identified L1_5 (BLACK bonus, costs 2 GREEN + 1 RED) and L1_21 (WHITE bonus, costs 2 RED + 1 BLACK) as ideal first purchases. Taking GREEN, RED, and BLACK tokens now directly positions me to buy one of these cards on my next turn, establishing early bonuses that will make future purchases more efficient. All three colors have 4 tokens available on the board. Since I currently have 0 tokens, taking these 3 will give me a total of 3, which is well below the 10-token limit, so no returns are necessary. This diversified approach maintains maximum flexibility while working toward concrete, achievable goals.

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Turn 1 analysis: I have 0 tokens, opponent has GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 suggesting they're targeting L1_5 (costs GREEN=2, RED=1) or L1_21 (costs RED=2, BLACK=1). Looking at the board, L1_40 stands out as the most efficient Level 1 card: costs WHITE=4, gives 1 prestige point AND a RED bonus. With 4 WHITE tokens available, I can take 2 WHITE now, then 2 more next turn to purchase L1_40 on turn 3. This gets me on the scoreboard fast while the opponent is still building bonuses. The RED bonus will then help me efficiently purchase cards like L2_55 (2 points, costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2 - reduced to RED=3 with bonus) or L2_54. This focused strategy avoids competing with opponent's colors and establishes an early point lead.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Unexpected error: Received RST_STREAM: Internal error
Reasoning: Let me analyze the current game state carefully.\n\nCurrent tokens: GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 (total 3 tokens)\nAvailable tokens on board: WHITE 2, BLUE 4, GREEN 3, RED 3, BLACK 3, GOLD 5\n\nLooking at my token holdings:\n- GREEN: 1\n- RED: 1\n- BLACK: 1\n\nNow checking L1_5 card: Cost is 2 GREEN + 1 RED. Since I have 1 GREEN and 1 RED token, I need:\n- 1 more GREEN token (2 total needed - 1 I have = 1)\n- I already have the 1 RED needed\n- No other colors needed\n\nBut wait - I cannot use gold tokens for a card purchase unless I'm substituting for missing colors. Let me recalculate: To purchase L1_5, I need to pay:\n- 2 GREEN tokens (I have 1, need 1 more)\n- 1 RED token (I have exactly 1)\n\nBut I already have the tokens I need! I have 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK tokens. The card costs 2 GREEN + 1 RED. I can use the 1 GREEN token I have, but I still need 1 more GREEN token AND the 1 RED token. I don't have 2 GREEN tokens, I only have 1. So I need to calculate if I can afford this or not.\n\nLet me recount: current tokens: GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1.\n\nCard L1_5 costs: GREEN:2, RED:1.\n\nToken payment:\n- For the 2 GREEN cost: I have 1 GREEN token, so I need 1 more GREEN. I cannot use BLACK or RED for GREEN cost unless I use gold tokens. Since I don\'t have gold tokens, I can only pay with GREEN tokens. So I only have 1 of the 2 GREEN tokens needed. I cannot pay 1 GREEN + 1 RED to satisfy a 2 GREEN cost.\n\nTherefore I CANNOT purchase L1_5 with my current tokens. I was mistaken in my previous reasoning.\n\nLet me also check L1_21: Cost is 2 RED + 1 BLACK. I have RED:1, BLACK:1. So I need:\n- 1 more RED token (2 total needed - 1 I have = 1)\n- I already have the 1 BLACK needed\n\nSame problem - I would need 2 RED tokens but only have 1.\n\nSo I cannot purchase any Level 1 cards this turn.\n\nLet me reconsider my options:\n\n1. TAKE_TOKENS: I have 3 tokens, so I can take more. If I take 3 more (total of 6), no returns needed. I should plan ahead for which cards I want to purchase.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- L1_5 (BLACK bonus): cost 2 GREEN + 1 RED\n- L1_21 (WHITE bonus): cost 2 RED + 1 BLACK\n- L1_40 (RED bonus, 1 prestige): cost 4 WHITE\n- L1_36 (RED bonus): cost 1 WHITE + 1 RED + 3 BLACK\n\nCurrent token distribution:\n- I have: GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1\n- Opponent has: WHITE 2\n\nAvailable board tokens:\n- GREEN: 3 available\n- RED: 3 available\n- BLACK: 3 available\n- WHITE: 2 available\n- BLUE: 4 available\n\nTo target L1_5, I need more GREEN and RED. I already have 1 GREEN and 1 RED. I need 1 more GREEN to have 2 GREEN total. So taking GREEN now would let me buy L1_5 next turn (GREEN:2, RED:1).\n\nTo target L1_21, I need more RED. I have BLACK:1 already, need RED:2 total. So taking RED now would let me buy L1_21 next turn (RED:2, BLACK:1).\n\nI also see L1_40 costs 4 WHITE. I don\'t have any WHITE tokens, and opponent has 2 WHITE. Board has 2 WHITE. This would require 2 turns of taking WHITE tokens.\n\nGood strategic options:\n1. Take GREEN, RED, and BLACK - this would give me GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2. This would let me purchase either L1_5 (2 GREEN + 1 RED) or L1_21 (2 RED + 1 BLACK) next turn. Maximum flexibility.\n2. Take GREEN, RED, and a different color (like BLUE) - but BLUE isn\'t immediately useful for Level 1 cards I\'m targeting.\n\nOption 1 seems best - it directly targets both L1_5 and L1_21, and all three colors are available (GREEN 3, RED 3, BLACK 3).\n\nBut wait - is there a better move? Let me think about the opponent. Opponent has WHITE:2. What might they be planning? They could be targeting L1_40 (4 WHITE cost). If they take 1-2 more WHITE tokens on their turn, they could buy L1_40, which gives 1 prestige point and RED bonus.\n\nHowever, board only has 2 WHITE tokens left, and opponent already has 2. If they take the 2 WHITE tokens, they\'d have 4 WHITE, but that would require taking 2 of same color which isn\'t allowed unless there are 4+ available. Actually, taking 2 WHITE of same color IS allowed if 4+ available, but there are only 2 WHITE available, so they cannot take 2 WHITE. They could take 1 WHITE plus 2 other colors.\n\nBut anyway, I should focus on my own optimal play.\n\nMy token count is currently 3. Taking 3 more gives me 6 total, which is safe (under 10 threshold). No returns needed.\n\nSo I should take GREEN, RED, and BLACK tokens. This sets up perfect positioning for next turn.\n\nChecking availability:\n- GREEN: 3 available (enough)\n- RED: 3 available (enough)\n- BLACK: 3 available (enough)\n\nThis is a valid TAKE_TOKENS move (3 different colors, each set to 1).\n\nLet me verify the previous error. The error said \
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_5]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_5
Reasoning: Current tokens: GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (total 3). Cannot purchase any card yet: L1_5 needs GREEN=2, RED=1 (short 1 GREEN); L1_21 needs RED=2, BLACK=1 (short 1 RED). Cannot take 2 of same color since no color has 4+ tokens available (GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=3, WHITE=2, BLUE=4). Must take 3 different colors. Need GREEN and RED to progress towards L1_5 and L1_21. Third color: BLACK is strategic - helps afford L1_21 directly, reduces supply to potentially block opponent, and fits my plan to build a BLACK/WHITE bonus engine. Taking GREEN, RED, BLACK gives me GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 (total 6 tokens), positioning me to buy L1_5 next turn. No returns needed (6 ≤ 10).

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2}
Reasoning: My original plan to take 2 WHITE tokens is invalid because only 2 WHITE remain on board (rule requires 4+ available to take 2 of same color). I must take 3 different colors. My target remains L1_40 (costs WHITE=4, gives 1 point + RED bonus) - the only Level 1 card with prestige points and fastest path to scoring. I'll take WHITE=1 to progress toward WHITE=4 cost. For the other 2 colors, I'm selecting RED=1 and BLACK=1 to begin positioning for my next target after L1_40: L2_55 (costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2, gives 2 points + WHITE bonus). With RED bonus from L1_40, L2_55 will only cost RED=3. This creates a clear path: Turn 3 - take final WHITE and 2 others to reach WHITE=4 total (8 tokens), Turn 4 - purchase L1_40 for 1 point and RED bonus, Turns 5-6 - collect remaining RED/BLACK/GREEN for L2_55, Turn 7 - purchase L2_55 for 2 more points. After this move I'll have WHITE=3, RED=1, BLACK=1 (5 tokens total, well under 10 limit). Board verification: WHITE=2 available (taking 1), RED=2 available (taking 1), BLACK=2 available (taking 1) - all legal.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have tokens GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 (total 6). Card L1_5 costs exactly 2 GREEN + 1 RED, which I can afford with my current tokens. Purchasing now gives me a BLACK bonus, which helps with future purchases (especially L1_21 which costs 1 BLACK), and reduces my token count from 6 to 3 (paying 3 tokens). This is more efficient than continuing to take tokens and potentially hitting the 10-token limit. Buying this cheap Level 1 card establishes my bonus engine early.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: WHITE=3, RED=1, BLACK=1 (5 tokens). My target L1_40 costs WHITE=4 and gives 1 point + RED bonus. Board has only WHITE=1 remaining - CRITICAL to take it now or opponent might take it, blocking my strategy. I'll take WHITE=1 (reaching WHITE=4 to afford L1_40 next turn), plus RED=1 and GREEN=1 to progress toward L2_55 (my next target: costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2, gives 2 points + WHITE bonus). With the RED bonus from L1_40, L2_55 will effectively cost GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2. After this move I'll have WHITE=4, RED=2, BLACK=1, GREEN=1 (8 tokens total, under 10 limit). Turn 4: purchase L1_40 for first point + RED bonus, leaving me RED=2, BLACK=1, GREEN=1. Then I only need RED=1, BLACK=1 more to afford L2_55. This is the most efficient path to 3 points by turn 6-7.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 3 tokens (RED=1, BLACK=2) and cannot purchase any card. My target L1_21 (WHITE bonus) costs 2 RED + 1 BLACK, but with my BLACK bonus I need 2 RED. Taking the RED token from the board (only 1 available) is critical. Taking the BLACK token denies my opponent and builds my stock for future purchases. The BLUE token is the third available color and provides flexibility for future cards like L1_30 or Level 2 cards. This move brings me to 6 total tokens, well under the 10-token limit, and positions me to purchase L1_21 on my next turn. No returns are necessary.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Perfect! I have WHITE=4 tokens, exactly matching the cost of L1_40. This is the moment I've been building toward over 3 turns. Purchasing L1_40 gives me my first prestige point AND a RED bonus. After this purchase I'll have GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 (3 tokens) and the RED bonus, positioning me well for L2_55 (costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2 - reduced to RED=3 with bonus). I currently have GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, so I'll only need RED=1 + BLACK=1 more to afford L2_55's 2 points. The board shows RED=0 and BLACK=0 currently available, but tokens should replenish or my opponent may return some. Purchasing L1_40 now is critical - if I delay, the opponent could take it, destroying my entire strategy. This move gets me on the scoreboard with 1 point and establishes my engine to reach L2_55 for 3 total points within 2-3 turns.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens (BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=3) and 1 BLACK bonus. The opponent currently has 1 prestige point and can afford L1_21 on their turn (they have RED=2, BLACK=1). I must deny them this card immediately. 

L1_21 costs RED=2, BLACK=1. With my BLACK bonus of 1, the effective cost is RED=2, BLACK=0. I have exactly RED=2 tokens, so I can purchase this card now. 

Strategic benefits:
1. **Immediate Denial**: Prevents opponent from gaining the WHITE bonus and improving their engine
2. **Bonus Engine**: Gives me WHITE bonus, making future purchases cheaper and positioning me for noble N1 (needs WHITE=4, BLUE=4)
3. **Token Management**: Spending 2 tokens reduces my count from 6 to 4, keeping me safe from the 10-token limit
4. **Progression**: With BLACK and WHITE bonuses, I can efficiently target high-value cards like L2_45 (2PP, costs WHITE=5, will cost me WHITE=4 with bonus) or L2_54 (1PP, costs WHITE=2, BLUE=3, RED=3, will cost me WHITE=1, BLUE=3, RED=3)
5. **Score Catch-up**: While this card has 0 prestige points, building my bonus engine efficiently is crucial before transitioning to point-scoring cards

This is clearly superior to taking tokens (which would bring me to 9 tokens and risk future returns) or reserving (which wastes an opportunity to secure a key bonus the opponent can afford).

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current status: GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 (4 tokens), RED bonus from L1_40. My target L2_55 costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2, which with my RED bonus becomes GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2. I have the correct GREEN, 2 of 3 RED needed, but only 1 of 2 BLACK needed. CRITICAL ISSUE: BLACK=0 tokens on board - I cannot collect BLACK this turn! Three options: (A) Take RED + others anyway - but BLACK unavailable blocks my purchase path, (B) Pivot to L2_45 (costs WHITE=5, 2 points) - would take 3 turns to collect WHITE=5, slower timeline, (C) RESERVE L2_55 - secures my target, gives me a GOLD token (flexible substitute for any color!), fastest path to points. After reserving, I'll have GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (5 tokens). To purchase L2_55 I need: GREEN=1 ✓, RED=3, BLACK=2. Using GOLD to substitute for either RED or BLACK, I only need 1 more token next turn (whichever becomes available). Turn 7 I can purchase L2_55 for 2 points, reaching 3 total. This is my fastest route to 15 points and prevents opponent from interfering with my strategy.

======================================================================================

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have 4 tokens (BLUE=1, BLACK=3) and 2 bonuses (WHITE=1, BLACK=1). I cannot afford any face-up card. The opponent has 1 prestige point and reserved L2_55, but cannot immediately threaten high-value cards. 

Key strategic considerations:
1. I need to build toward high-value cards to catch up in prestige points
2. Primary targets: L2_45 (2PP, costs WHITE=5 → effective WHITE=4 with bonus) and L2_54 (1PP, costs WHITE=2, BLUE=3, RED=3 → effective WHITE=1, BLUE=3, RED=3)
3. Token bank has WHITE=4, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=0
4. I have room for 6 more tokens before reaching the 10-token limit
5. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN positions me optimally:
   - WHITE: Essential for L2_45 and L2_54, also needed for noble N1
   - BLUE: Needed for L2_54, L1_19, and noble N1
   - GREEN: Needed for L1_9 and L1_19
6. This move denies these colors to my opponent while keeping me well under the token limit (4 → 7 tokens)
7. Alternative of reserving L2_45 is suboptimal since I still need WHITE=4 to purchase it, and taking tokens now accelerates my timeline more effectively

This diversified token acquisition maintains maximum flexibility while building toward multiple viable purchase paths and noble N1 (BLUE=4, WHITE=4).

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current status: I have GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (5 tokens), RED bonus, and L2_55 reserved. L2_55 costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2, which with my RED bonus becomes effective cost GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2. Checking if I can purchase NOW: I have GREEN=1✓, RED=2 (need 3)✗, BLACK=1+GOLD=1 (covers 2)✓. I'm exactly 1 RED token SHORT! Board shows RED=2 available - CRITICAL to take RED=1 now to purchase L2_55 next turn for 2 points (bringing me to 3 total). For the other 2 colors, I'm taking WHITE=1 and GREEN=1 to position for post-L2_55 strategy. After L2_55 purchase I'll have RED+WHITE bonuses, making L2_45 attractive (costs WHITE=5, gives 2 points+BLACK bonus; with WHITE bonus needs WHITE=4). After this move I'll have WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 tokens under 10 limit). Turn 7 plan: purchase L2_55 using GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=1+GOLD=1, reaching 3 points with RED+WHITE bonuses. Then collect WHITE=3 more for L2_45 by turn 9-10 (5 total points), maintaining lead over opponent's 0 points.

L1_19 provides a WHITE bonus, giving me WHITE=2 bonuses total and making L2_45 cost effective WHITE=3. This move also denies these colors to my opponent and builds toward noble N1 (BLUE=4, WHITE=4).

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current status: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 tokens), RED bonus. I have my reserved L2_55 which costs GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=2 (effective GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 with my RED bonus). CRITICAL REALIZATION: I CAN PURCHASE L2_55 RIGHT NOW! Verification: GREEN need 1 have 2✓, RED need 3 have 3✓, BLACK need 2 have 1+GOLD=1✓. This is PERFECT! Purchasing L2_55 now will give me 2 prestige points (reaching 3 total), give me WHITE bonus (RED+WHITE bonuses combined), and leave me with WHITE=1 GREEN=1 (2 tokens). After purchase I'll have RED=1+WHITE=1 bonuses, positioning me perfectly for L2_45 (costs WHITE=5 but with WHITE bonus = WHITE=4, gives 2 points+BLACK bonus). I already have WHITE=1 so I need only WHITE=3 more to reach 5 points. Meanwhile opponent has 0 points and is at max token capacity (10 tokens), likely forced to purchase low-value cards or waste turns. My 3-point lead with strong bonuses puts me on track to 15 points first. This is the culmination of my 7-turn strategy!

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=2, BLK=4}
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=3), which is the maximum allowed. I cannot take any more tokens without returning some, which would be inefficient. I need to purchase a card to reduce my token count and build my engine.

Analyzing affordable cards:
- L1_19 costs BLUE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=1. With my BLACK bonus, effective cost is BLUE=2, GREEN=2. I have exactly these tokens.
- All other cards require RED tokens which I lack, or are too expensive.

Strategic benefits of purchasing L1_19:
1. **Token management**: Reduces my token count from 10 to 6, avoiding the token limit penalty
2. **Bonus engine**: Gives me WHITE bonus (would have WHITE=2 bonuses total), making future purchases significantly cheaper
3. **Noble positioning**: Contributes toward noble N1 (requires BLUE=4, WHITE=4)
4. **Enables L2_45**: After this purchase, L2_45 (2 prestige points) would cost effective WHITE=3 instead of WHITE=4
5. **Opponent analysis**: Opponent has 3 points but only 2 tokens and cannot afford any cards this turn, so I have time to build

This is superior to reserving (wastes a turn when I need to spend tokens) or taking/returning tokens (inefficient). The WHITE bonus synergizes perfectly with my existing BLACK bonus and positions me for high-value cards.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: Current status: WHITE=1, GREEN=1 (2 tokens), WHITE=1 + RED=1 bonuses, 3 points. My target is L2_45 (costs WHITE=5, with my bonus = WHITE=4, gives 2 points + BLACK bonus). I need WHITE=3 more. Board has WHITE=1 available. CRITICAL THREAT DETECTED: Opponent has WHITE=2 bonus and WHITE=2 tokens! For them, L2_45 costs effective WHITE=3, meaning they only need WHITE=1 more to purchase it! If I take WHITE=1 this turn, board becomes WHITE=0, blocking them temporarily. But if WHITE replenishes by opponent's next turn, they could grab it and steal L2_45 before I accumulate enough, destroying my entire 8-turn strategy. SAFEST MOVE: Reserve L2_45 NOW to guarantee exclusive access. I receive 1 GOLD token (universal substitute). After reserving: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, GOLD=1 (3 tokens). To purchase L2_45 (effective cost WHITE=4 with bonus), I can use WHITE=3 + GOLD=1. Over next 2-3 turns, collect WHITE=2 more to reach WHITE=3, then purchase L2_45 for 2 points (5 total points). This eliminates the race condition, secures my primary scoring path to 5 points by turn 11, and maintains my 3-point lead over opponent's 0 points. Opponent remains focused on difficult L3_82 (needs BLACK=3 more). Reservation is strategically optimal despite 1-turn delay.

======================================================================================

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3) with bonuses WHITE=2 and BLACK=1. I cannot afford any face-up cards right now, and I have room for 4 more tokens. Taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED tokens is optimal for several reasons:

1. **BLUE**: I only have 1 BLUE token, but need more for targets like L1_30 (effective cost BLUE=2, RED=2) and L2_54 (effective cost BLUE=3, RED=3, 1 prestige point).

2. **GREEN**: I have 0 GREEN tokens, but taking 1 enables me to purchase L1_9 next turn (costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1). With my bonuses (WHITE=2, BLACK=1), L1_9 effectively costs GREEN=1, RED=1, giving me a BLUE bonus.

3. **RED**: I have 0 RED tokens, which appear in many card costs. Taking 1 RED now positions me for L1_9, L1_30, and L2_54 while denying this critical color to my opponent who has 0 RED tokens.

4. **Token management**: Taking these 3 tokens brings me to 9 total, staying safely under the 10-token limit without needing returns.

5. **Strategic positioning**: After this move, I'll have multiple purchase options next turn:
   - L1_9 for BLUE bonus (costs me GREEN=1, RED=1)
   - L1_30 for GREEN bonus (need 1 more RED, costs me BLUE=2, RED=2)
   - L1_36 for RED bonus (need to acquire 1 more RED, costs me RED=1, BLACK=2)

6. **Opponent denial**: The opponent has 0 RED and 1 GREEN, so taking these colors denies them key resources while they only have 3 total tokens and cannot threaten major purchases.

This diversified approach builds toward noble N1 (BLUE=4, WHITE=4) while creating multiple pathways to acquire more bonuses and eventually prestige points.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current status: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, GOLD=1 (3 tokens), WHITE=1+RED=1 bonuses, 3 points, L2_45 reserved. My target L2_45 costs WHITE=5, with my WHITE bonus = effective WHITE=4. I can pay with combinations like WHITE=3+GOLD=1 or WHITE=2+GOLD=2. Currently have WHITE=1+GOLD=1, so I need 2 more payment units. Board shows WHITE=1 available - CRITICAL to take it now to advance toward L2_45. I'll take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 (3 different colors, valid per rules). After this move: WHITE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=1 (6 tokens, under 10 limit). Next turn options: (A) take WHITE=1 more → WHITE=3+GOLD=1 = can purchase L2_45, OR (B) reserve a card for GOLD=1 → WHITE=2+GOLD=2 = can purchase L2_45. Either path reaches my 5-point goal by turn 11 with BLACK bonus added. I considered reserving L2_67 now (would give immediate GOLD=1 and block opponent), but that commits me to collecting BLUE=4 later (time-consuming). Taking tokens maintains flexibility to reassess after L2_45 whether to pursue L2_67, L2_63, build toward Level 3 cards, or accumulate more bonuses for L3_82. Opponent has 0 points and can only afford 0-point Level 1 cards currently, so my 3-point lead is secure. This move directly advances my fastest scoring path established over 8 turns.

======================================================================================

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have 9 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3) which is dangerously close to the 10-token limit. I must spend tokens this turn to avoid forced returns later. I have 0 prestige points while the opponent has 3 points and a reserved 2PP card (L2_45), so I need to accelerate my engine.

Analyzing affordable cards:
- L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1 → all covered by my tokens
- L1_9 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 → affordable  
- L1_36 costs WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 → affordable (uses all my BLACK tokens)

L1_3 is the optimal choice because:
1. **Token management**: Spends exactly 5 tokens, bringing me from 9 to 4 tokens (plenty of room for future collection)
2. **Bonus engine**: Gives me BLACK=2 bonus (up from BLACK=1), which is powerful for targeting:
   - Noble N7 (needs BLACK=3, GREEN=3, RED=3) - now just 1 BLACK bonus away
   - L3_82 (5PP) cost reduces from BLACK=7 to effective BLACK=5
   - L2_42 (1PP) cost reduces from BLACK=2 to effective BLACK=1
3. **Resource positioning**: Leaves me with GREEN=1 and BLACK=3 tokens to use on future purchases
4. **Opponent denial**: Uses scarce BLUE tokens (only 2 on board), denying them from opponent who has 0 BLUE bonuses
5. **Strategic positioning**: With WHITE=2 and BLACK=2 bonuses, I can efficiently target:
   - L2_67 (2PP): effective cost BLUE=4, GREEN=2
   - L2_54 (1PP): effective cost WHITE=1, BLUE=3, RED=3
6. **Noble path**: This keeps options open for both N1 (needs BLUE=4, WHITE=4) and N7 (BLACK=3, GREEN=3, RED=3) nobles

This purchase efficiently spends my tokens, avoids the token limit penalty, strengthens my bonus engine significantly, and maintains flexibility for multiple high-point targets.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, GRN=2, RED=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current status: WHITE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=1 (6 tokens), WHITE=1+RED=1 bonuses, 3 points, L2_45 reserved (costs effective WHITE=4). CRITICAL DISCOVERY: My previous plan to take WHITE=1 is IMPOSSIBLE - board shows WHITE=0! To purchase L2_45, I need payment units totaling 4, but have only WHITE=2+GOLD=1=3 units, exactly 1 short. OPTIMAL SOLUTION: Reserve L2_67 NOW to receive automatic GOLD=1, reaching WHITE=2+GOLD=2=4 payment units, enabling L2_45 purchase next turn! Why L2_67? (1) Immediate strategic need (GOLD=1 unlocks L2_45), (2) High value itself (2 points + RED bonus), (3) Costs effective BLUE=4+GREEN=2 with my WHITE bonus, (4) Board has abundant BLUE=4 currently available vs scarce WHITE=0 and GREEN=1. Timeline: Turn 10 reserve L2_67→GOLD=2 total, Turn 11 purchase L2_45 spending WHITE=2+GOLD=2→5 points+BLACK bonus, Turns 12-13 collect BLUE=4 (board currently shows BLUE=4), Turn 14 purchase L2_67→7 points+RED=2 bonus. Opponent at 0 points with no affordable cards. This is my fastest guaranteed path forward.

======================================================================================

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, GRN=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, BLACK=3) with bonuses WHITE=2, BLACK=2, and 0 prestige points. The opponent has 3 points with two reserved 2PP cards, so I need to accelerate toward points while managing token scarcity.

Key analysis:
1. I cannot purchase any card this turn - all affordable cards require RED tokens which I lack
2. Token bank availability: WHITE=0, BLUE=4, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=1
3. GREEN is critically scarce (only 1 token left) and needed for multiple targets
4. Taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED (1 each) positions me optimally:
   - GREEN: Secures the last token of this scarce color, needed for L1_9, L2_42, L2_63, and noble N7
   - BLUE: Essential for L1_30, L2_54, L1_22, and noble N1/N4; denying from opponent who has 0 BLUE
   - RED: Required for L1_9, L1_30, L2_54, L2_59 and noble N7; opponent has only 1 RED token
5. This brings me to 9 total tokens, staying safely under the limit without returns
6. Next turn I can purchase L1_9 (costs GREEN=1, RED=1) to gain BLUE bonus, enabling L2_54 (1PP) and other high-value cards
7. This diversified acquisition builds toward multiple paths: noble N1 (BLUE=4, WHITE=4), noble N7 (BLACK=3, GREEN=3, RED=3), and Level 2/3 point cards

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, GRN=2, RED=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Current status: WHITE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=2 (7 tokens), WHITE=1+RED=1 bonuses, 3 points, L2_45+L2_67 reserved. This is Turn 11, exactly as planned in my Turn 10 reasoning! I can now purchase L2_45: it costs WHITE=5, with my WHITE bonus = effective WHITE=4. I have WHITE=2 + GOLD=2 = 4 payment units - PERFECT MATCH! Verification: L2_45 is in my reserved cards, costs effective WHITE=4 with my bonus, I pay WHITE=2 tokens + GOLD=2 tokens = 4 units. Purchasing L2_45 gives me 2 prestige points (reaching 5 total), BLACK bonus (WHITE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses), and leaves me with GREEN=2, RED=1 (3 tokens). Next target: L2_67 costs WHITE=1+BLUE=4+GREEN=2, with my WHITE bonus = effective BLUE=4+GREEN=2. I have GREEN=2 already, need BLUE=4 (board shows BLUE=3, will collect over 2 turns), then purchase L2_67 for 2 more points (7 total) + RED=2 bonus. With WHITE=1+RED=2+BLACK=1 bonuses, I'll target Level 3 cards or nobles to reach 15 points. Opponent stuck at 0 points with 9 tokens. My 5-point lead with strong bonus engine is decisive.

======================================================================================

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I currently have 9 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=3) which is dangerously close to the 10-token limit, so I should purchase a card this turn rather than take tokens. I have two affordable options:

1. **L1_9** (BLUE bonus): Costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. With my WHITE=2 and BLACK=2 bonuses, I effectively need GREEN=1, RED=1. I have both, so I can purchase this. It gives me a BLUE bonus, diversifying my engine to WHITE=2, BLACK=2, BLUE=1.

2. **L1_36** (RED bonus): Costs WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=3. With my bonuses, I need RED=1, BLACK=1. I can afford this, but RED bonus is less versatile than BLUE.

**L1_9 is superior** because:
- BLUE bonus is highly valuable for targeting L2_54 (1PP), Level 3 cards, and nobles
- It preserves my BLACK=3 tokens for future purchases
- It positions me to buy L1_22 next turn (WHITE bonus), reaching WHITE=3 bonus for noble N1
- After purchase, I'll have 7 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=3), well under the limit
- The opponent has no BLUE bonuses, so this gives me a competitive edge

This purchase efficiently spends tokens while building a diversified bonus engine that can target multiple point cards and nobles.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current status: GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=0 (3 tokens), WHITE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 5 points, L2_67 reserved. My original plan was collecting BLUE=4 over 4 turns to purchase L2_67 (costs effective BLUE=4+GREEN=2), but this creates 10-token limit problems requiring wasteful token returns. OPTIMAL PIVOT: Reserve L2_63 NOW. L2_63 costs GREEN=5, gives 2 points+GREEN bonus—same 2-point value as L2_67 but achievable via flexible GOLD tokens! After reserving: GREEN=2+GOLD=1=3 payment units toward the 5 needed. Timeline: Turn 12 (now) reserve L2_63→GOLD=1, Turn 13 reserve another high-value card→GOLD=2 (GREEN=2+GOLD=2=4 units), Turn 14 take GREEN=1→GREEN=3 or reserve third card→GOLD=3, Turn 15 purchase L2_63 using GREEN+GOLD→7 points+GREEN bonus. This reaches 7 points in 4 turns (same timeframe as BLUE path) while avoiding token overflow and providing flexibility to reassess each turn. The GOLD tokens can substitute for any color, so if a better opportunity appears (like L2_67 becoming easier or a Level 3 card), I can pivot. Blocking L2_63 from opponent (not threatening with 0 points). After 7 points with WHITE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1+GREEN=1 diverse bonuses, I'll target Level 3 cards or nobles toward 15 points. This is strategically superior to rigid BLUE collection.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I have 0 prestige points while the opponent has 5 points and a growing engine. I currently cannot afford any face-up cards due to lacking RED tokens, and I have only 7 tokens with room for 3 more. The optimal play is to take RED, GREEN, and BLUE tokens for three critical reasons: First, RED is my most significant deficiency (I have 0 tokens and no bonus), and RED appears in multiple target cards (L1_36, L1_30, L2_54, L2_59, L2_47). Second, GREEN is extremely scarce with only 1 token remaining on the board, and securing it denies this resource from my opponent while building toward cards like L1_30, L2_42, L2_59 and noble N7. Third, BLUE is essential for noble N1 and multiple Level 2 point cards, and I currently have only 1 BLUE token. This move brings me to exactly 10 tokens without requiring any returns, positioning me to purchase L1_22 next turn (for WHITE=3 bonus) or L1_36 (for RED bonus), either of which strengthens my engine for subsequent high-value purchases like L2_67 (2PP) or L2_54 (1PP). This engine-building approach is more valuable than immediately reserving a point card I cannot afford, as it creates multiple pathways to score while building a stronger long-term position.

Reasoning: Current status: GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=1 (4 tokens), WHITE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 5 points, L2_67 and L2_63 reserved. Following my Turn 12 plan to accumulate GOLD tokens via reservations. Reserving L3_82 (5-point card, WHITE bonus, costs effective WHITE=2+BLACK=6 with my bonuses) accomplishes multiple goals: (1) Receive GOLD=1 → total GOLD=2, bringing me to GREEN=2+GOLD=2=4 payment units for L2_63 (need 5), just 1 unit short. (2) Secure valuable 5-point L3_82 for late game, achievable with my WHITE+BLACK bonuses after building more resources. (3) Maintain flexibility - with GOLD=2, I can pursue L2_63 if GREEN appears on board (take GREEN=1 → purchase L2_63 for 7 points), OR pivot to L2_67 by collecting BLUE=2 over 2 turns (BLUE=2+GREEN=2+GOLD=2 satisfies its BLUE=4+GREEN=2 cost) for 7 points. Board shows BLUE=2, GOLD=4 available, opponent at 10 tokens (must purchase/return) which may refresh GREEN supply. At 3 reserved cards max, this is my last reservation until I purchase one. This is strategically superior to taking tokens now (GREEN=0 on board, BLUE collection requires 3+ turns) as it accelerates both paths via GOLD flexibility. Timeline: Turn 14 take GREEN (if available) OR BLUE, Turn 15 purchase L2_63 OR continue building for L2_67, reaching 7 points by Turn 15-16. Opponent stuck at 0 points, my 5-point lead secure.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=3) which means taking tokens would require discarding some, which is highly inefficient. I can afford two cards this turn:

1. **L1_22** (WHITE bonus): Costs BLUE=2, BLACK=2. With my BLACK=2 bonus, I only need to pay BLUE=1 token. This gives me WHITE=3 bonus, putting me just 1 WHITE bonus away from noble N1 (needs BLUE=4, WHITE=4). After purchase, I'll have 9 tokens remaining, giving me flexibility for future token collection.

2. **L1_36** (RED bonus): Costs WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=3. With my bonuses (WHITE=2, BLACK=2), I pay RED=1, BLACK=1. This gives me RED=1 bonus but only puts me at 8 tokens, and I'm further from the nobles.

**L1_22 is superior** because:
- It maximizes my token efficiency (spending only 1 token vs 2)
- WHITE=3 bonus is extremely valuable for targeting noble N1 (3 prestige points)
- I maintain more tokens for future purchases (9 vs 8)
- The opponent has 5 points and is closing in on victory; I need to build toward a 3-point noble efficiently
- After this purchase, I can target L1_16 (1PP, gives BLUE bonus) or continue building toward Level 2 point cards

This purchase optimally positions my engine for a quick pivot to scoring points through nobles and high-value cards while maintaining token flexibility.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Current status: GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=2 (5 tokens), WHITE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 5 points, 3/3 reserved cards (L2_67, L2_63, L3_82). CRITICAL BLOCKAGE: Board shows GREEN=0, so I cannot collect GREEN tokens needed for L2_63 (needs GREEN=5 total, have GREEN=2+GOLD=2=4). L2_67 requires BLUE=4+GREEN=2 effective cost - I have GREEN=2 but need BLUE=4 with only GOLD=2 to help. Both paths blocked. BREAKTHROUGH: Purchase L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point, costs effective RED=3). This is affordable: RED=1 token + GOLD=2 tokens = 3 payment units for RED=3 cost. Three strategic wins: (1) Score 1 point →6 points (extending lead vs opponent's 0), (2) Gain BLUE=1 bonus (reduces L2_67's cost from BLUE=4+GREEN=2 to BLUE=3+GREEN=2, saving 1 BLUE token!), (3) Free a reservation slot (→2/3 reserved), enabling Turn 15 reservation for another GOLD token. After purchase: GREEN=2 tokens, WHITE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1+BLUE=1 bonuses, 6 points. Timeline: Turn 15 reserve a high-value Level 2 card→GOLD=1, Turn 16-17 collect BLUE tokens (board has BLUE=3 available, take BLUE=1 each turn as part of 3-token action), Turn 18 purchase L2_67 (pay GREEN=2+BLUE=3)→8 points+RED=2 bonus. The BLUE bonus transforms L2_67 from unaffordable into a 4-turn target. Opponent at 0 points with strong bonuses but no immediate scoring path. My 6-point lead with accelerated L2_67 path maintains dominance toward 15-point goal.

======================================================================================

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I currently have 9 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=3), dangerously close to the 10-token limit. The opponent has 6 points and reserved cards worth 9 more points, so I must act efficiently to avoid forced discards while building my engine.

Analyzing affordable options:
1. **Level 1 cards**: L1_36 and L1_17 are both affordable
2. **Level 2/3 cards**: None are affordable without more bonuses or tokens
3. **Taking tokens**: At 9 tokens, any token collection would require discarding, which is inefficient

**L1_36 (RED bonus) is the optimal choice** because:
- **Token efficiency**: Costs only RED=1, BLACK=1 (2 tokens total) due to my WHITE=3 and BLACK=2 bonuses, bringing me from 9 to 7 tokens (safe buffer)
- **Resource preservation**: Does NOT require spending any GREEN tokens, which is critical since GREEN=0 tokens remain on the board and I have no GREEN bonuses
- **Engine diversification**: Gives me RED=1 bonus, enabling access to RED-heavy point cards like L2_54 (1PP), L2_59 (1PP), and L2_47 (1PP)
- **Future positioning**: After purchase, I can target L1_30 (GREEN bonus) next turn by taking RED tokens, building toward both GREEN bonuses and eventual Level 2 point cards
- **Opponent denial**: Removes a RED bonus card from the board that the opponent could potentially purchase

**Alternative L1_17 analysis**:
- Costs 4 tokens (BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1), leaving only 5 tokens
- Spending precious GREEN when none remain on board is risky
- While it gives WHITE=4 bonus (close to noble N1), the path to points is slower

**Final decision**: Purchase L1_36 to efficiently manage tokens, preserve scarce GREEN resources, diversify my bonus engine with RED, and maintain flexibility for multiple paths to points while staying safely under the token limit.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current status: GREEN=2 tokens only, WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 6 points, 3/3 reserved (L2_67, L2_63, L3_82). L2_63 blocked (board has GREEN=0, need GREEN=3 more but impossible to collect). L3_82 too expensive (need WHITE=2+BLACK=6 effective). L2_67 IS achievable: costs WHITE=1+BLUE=4+GREEN=2 raw, with my WHITE=1+BLUE=1 bonuses = effective BLUE=3+GREEN=2. I have GREEN=2 already - PERFECT! Just need BLUE=3. Board shows BLUE=3 available. OPTIMAL PATH: Take BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 now (valid 3-color action, board has BLUE=3+RED=4+BLACK=2 all available) → tokens become GREEN=2+BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 (5 total, under 10 limit). Turn 16: take more BLUE → BLUE=2 total. Turn 17: take final BLUE → BLUE=3 total. Turn 18: purchase L2_67 paying BLUE=3+GREEN=2 → 8 points total + RED=2 bonus (powerful for future Level 3 cards). Considered L1_17 (costs effective GREEN=1, gives WHITE=2 bonus+0 points) but purchasing face-up card doesn't free reservation slots - I'd still be stuck at 3/3 reserved with no ability to get GOLD tokens via new reservations. Considered L2_47 face-up (1 point, costs effective BLUE=1+GREEN=2+RED=2) but opponent with WHITE=3+BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=2 bonuses could collect RED tokens and snipe it, whereas my L2_67 is reserved and SAFE from opponent interference. This BLUE collection path reaches 8 points by Turn 18 with strong RED=2 bonus, maintaining 8-point lead vs opponent's 0 points. Most secure, highest-scoring path forward.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Analyzing my current position: I have 7 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=2) and 0 prestige points, while opponent has 6 points with 3 reserved cards worth 9 more points. I need to start scoring while managing resources wisely.

Key calculations with my bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2):
- L1_15 costs BLACK=3, after BLACK=2 bonus I need only BLACK=1 token
- L1_17 costs GREEN=1 (after bonuses), which would spend precious GREEN tokens
- Level 2/3 point cards are unaffordable currently
- GREEN tokens on board = 0, making them extremely valuable

The optimal play is purchasing L1_15 for three critical reasons:

1. **Resource preservation**: Costs BLACK=1 instead of GREEN=1, saving my scarce GREEN tokens (board has GREEN=0) for future 1PP cards like L2_42 and L2_59 that require GREEN.

2. **Strategic bonus**: Gives me BLUE=2 bonus (total BLUE=2), positioning me for:
   - Noble N1 (needs BLUE=4, WHITE=4)
   - L2_47 (1PP, needs BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3)
   - Multiple Level 3 point cards

3. **Token efficiency**: Spending only 1 BLACK token leaves me with 6 tokens, allowing me to take 3 tokens next turn (including RED to target Level 2 point cards) without exceeding the limit.

This purchase denies opponent a BLUE bonus card while building my engine toward immediate point-scoring opportunities, which is critical given their 6-point lead.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current status: BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 (5 tokens), WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 6 points, 3/3 reserved (L2_67, L2_63, L3_82). Following Turn 15 plan to collect BLUE tokens for L2_67 purchase. L2_67 costs WHITE=1+BLUE=4+GREEN=2 raw; with my bonuses = effective BLUE=3+GREEN=2. Current: BLUE=1, GREEN=2 (need BLUE=2 more). Board has BLUE=2 available but cannot take 2 same color (requires 4+ on board per rules). Must take 3 different colors. Optimal: Take BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 → tokens become BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 (8 total, under 10 limit, no return needed). This advances L2_67 path: need BLUE=1 more. Timeline: Turn 17 take BLUE=1+others (with 1 token return) → BLUE=3+GREEN=2, Turn 18 purchase L2_67 → 8 points+RED=2 bonus. RED denial blocks opponent (needs RED for L2_54/L2_59/L2_47 face-up cards, currently has RED=0 tokens). Considered purchasing L1_30 (affordable with BLUE=1+RED=1, gives GREEN bonus+0 points) but extends timeline by 2 turns (Turn 20 vs Turn 18 for 8 points) because would still need BLUE=3 collection over 3 turns. Token collection path fastest. Verified: Board BLUE=2≥1✓, RED=3≥1✓, BLACK=2≥1✓, taking 3 different colors✓, no token return needed✓. Maintaining 6-point lead vs opponent's 0 points.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Analysis of critical position: Opponent has 6 points with 9 more points in reserve (L2_67, L2_63, L3_82). They can purchase L2_47 this turn for 1 point using their BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2 tokens, reaching 7 points and maintaining strong momentum. 

Reserving L2_47 serves three critical purposes: 1) Denies opponent their only viable face-up scoring opportunity this turn (they cannot buy L2_54 due to lacking WHITE tokens, and their reserved cards are unaffordable), 2) Secures me a 1PP card that synergizes with my existing bonuses (after purchase I'll have BLUE=3, just 1 away from noble N1), and 3) Provides a GOLD token (board has 5) which is essential for affording the card next turn.

My plan: Reserve L2_47 now, receive GOLD=1. Next turn, collect RED=1, BLUE=1, WHITE=1 tokens (board supplies sufficient quantities). Then purchase L2_47 using my existing GREEN=2 tokens, the collected RED=1 token, and GOLD=1 substituting for the second RED token. This scores my first point while significantly disrupting opponent's tempo during their critical 6-point position.

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current status: BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 (8 tokens), WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 6 points, 3/3 reserved (L2_67, L2_63, L3_82). Following my Turn 16 plan to collect the final BLUE token for L2_67 purchase. L2_67 costs WHITE=1+BLUE=4+GREEN=2 raw; with my bonuses WHITE=1+BLUE=1, effective cost = BLUE=3+GREEN=2. Current tokens: BLUE=2+GREEN=2, need exactly BLUE=1 more! Board has BLUE=1 available (confirm available✓). Must take 3 different colors per rules. Optimal: Take BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 (board shows BLUE=1✓+RED=2✓+BLACK=1✓ all available). After taking: BLUE=3+GREEN=2+RED=3+BLACK=3+WHITE=0 = 11 tokens, exceeds 10 limit, must return 1 token. Return BLACK=1 (least critical after purchase; RED=3 more useful for future face-up cards like L2_65). Result: BLUE=3+GREEN=2+RED=3+BLACK=2 = 10 tokens. Turn 18: Purchase L2_67 paying BLUE=3+GREEN=2 → 8 points + RED=2 bonus (powerful for future Level 3 cards). This reaches 8 points in 2 turns vs opponent's 0 points, maintaining 8-point lead. Considered purchasing L1_30 (costs effective BLUE=1+RED=1, gives GREEN bonus) but this SLOWS timeline: would gain GREEN bonus but leave only BLUE=1 token, need 2 more turns collecting BLUE=2 (board only has BLUE=1, can't take 2 same color), reaching 8 points Turn 19 vs Turn 18 with token path. Considered L1_17 (costs effective GREEN=1, gives WHITE=2 bonus) but extra WHITE bonus doesn't help L2_67 (WHITE=1 already covered by my WHITE=1 bonus), same BLUE=3+GREEN=2 effective cost, and delays by 1 turn. Token collection is fastest path to 8 points, most secure (L2_67 reserved, no opponent interference risk).

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Critical analysis: Opponent has 6 points and can purchase reserved L2_67 this turn (costs BLUE=3, which they have) reaching 8 points. I have 0 points and MUST start scoring immediately. 

My reserved L2_47 (1PP) is the fastest path to points. Current cost after bonuses: GREEN=2, RED=2. I have GREEN=2, RED=0, GOLD=1. I need 1 RED token (or equivalent via gold substitution).

Board tokens: WHITE=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 available. Taking RED=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1 brings me to exactly 10 tokens with no discards. Next turn I can purchase L2_47 using GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=1 (substituting gold for the second RED), scoring my first point and gaining BLUE=3 bonus.

Alternative actions:
- Cannot afford any face-up cards (all require RED tokens I lack)
- Reserving another card would delay scoring while opponent reaches 8+ points
- Taking different tokens isn't possible (only WHITE/RED/BLACK available)

This move is mandatory for survival: it denies opponent potential resources, maintains token efficiency, and creates the only viable path to scoring before the opponent wins.

Reasoning: Current status: BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2 (10 tokens), WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 bonuses, 6 points, 3/3 reserved (L2_67, L2_63, L3_82). THIS IS IT - the moment I've been building toward! L2_67 costs WHITE=1+BLUE=4+GREEN=2 raw; with my WHITE=1+BLUE=1 bonuses, effective cost = BLUE=3+GREEN=2. I have EXACTLY BLUE=3+GREEN=2 tokens! PURCHASE L2_67 NOW! This achieves: (1) Score 2 points → 8 points total, maintaining 8-0 lead over opponent, (2) Gain RED=2 bonus → total RED=3 bonus (powerful for future Level 3 cards like L3_79 which needs RED=5 raw but only RED=2 effective with my bonus), (3) Free a reservation slot → 2/3 reserved, enabling future GOLD token acquisition, (4) Reduce tokens from 10 to 5, creating space for future collection. Board shows BLUE=0+GREEN=0+RED=0+BLACK=0, only WHITE=1+GOLD=4 available - if I delay, I'm blocked from taking useful tokens. Verified alternatives: L1_30 (0 points, costs effective BLUE=1+RED=1) and L1_17 (0 points, costs effective GREEN=1) are both affordable but give 0 points vs L2_67's 2 points - NO COMPARISON. This is Turn 18, exactly when I planned this purchase in my Turn 17 reasoning. After purchase: 8 points, RED=3 bonus positions me for high-value Level 3 cards. Path to 15 points clear.

I have tokens: GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=1 → Can purchase L2_47 NOW using GREEN=2, RED=1, GOLD=1 (substituting gold for second RED)

This purchase is optimal because:
1. **Immediate scoring**: Gives my first prestige point (critical with opponent at 8)
2. **Premium bonus**: BLUE=3 bonus gives me BLUE=5 total, which is exceptional for Level 3 cards:
   - L3_84 (4PP) needs only BLUE=2 more
   - L3_78 (5PP) needs WHITE=4 more
   - L3_86 (5PP) needs BLUE=2, GREEN=3
3. **Noble positioning**: BLUE=5 puts me 80% toward Noble N1 (BLUE=4, WHITE=4)
4. **Resource efficiency**: Uses exactly my available GREEN tokens (board has only GREEN=2) and frees token space
5. **Guaranteed availability**: My reserved card cannot be taken by opponent

After purchase: 1PP, tokens=WHITE=3, BLUE=1, BLACK=2 (6 total), bonuses=WHITE=3, BLUE=5, RED=1, BLACK=2
Next turn: Take BLUE=2, WHITE=1 to target L3_84 (4PP) or collect for other high-value plays while maintaining 9-token capacity.

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=5, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current: 8 points, RED=3+BLACK=2 tokens (5 total), WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=2+BLACK=1 bonuses, 2/3 reserved (L2_63, L3_82). Successfully purchased L2_67 last turn as planned! Now analyzing path to 15 points (need 7 more). CRITICAL INSIGHT: Board has BLACK=0 - my BLACK=2 tokens are irreplaceable and MUST be preserved for BLACK-cost cards. Reserved cards analysis: L2_63 needs GREEN=5 (board has GREEN=4, long collection path), L3_82 needs effective WHITE=2+BLACK=6 (BLACK=0 on board = PERMANENTLY BLOCKED). Both reserved cards are poor paths. BREAKTHROUGH PATH: L3_79 (3 points, gives WHITE bonus) costs effective BLUE=2+GREEN=3+RED=3+BLACK=2. I have RED=3+BLACK=2 already! Just need BLUE=2+GREEN=3 (board has BLUE=3+GREEN=4). After L3_79→11 points, purchase L3_84 (4 points, costs effective BLUE=6 with my BLUE=1 bonus)→15 points EXACTLY! OPTIMAL TURN 19 MOVE: Reserve L3_84 NOW. Three strategic wins: (1) Secure L3_84 from opponent (they have WHITE=3+BLUE=3 bonuses, could compete for it), (2) Get GOLD=1 token (board has GOLD=5)→enables substitution flexibility for L3_79 purchase (GOLD substitutes for GREEN=1, letting me purchase T22 instead of T23), (3) Clear 8-turn path to VICTORY. Timeline: T19=Reserve L3_84→GOLD=1 (6 tokens), T20=Take GREEN=2→8 tokens, T21=Take BLUE=2→10 tokens, T22=Purchase L3_79 using RED=3+BLACK=2+BLUE=2+GREEN=2+GOLD=1→11 points+WHITE=2 bonus+0 tokens, T23-26=Collect BLUE=6 (T23: BLUE=2, T24: BLUE=2, T25-26: BLUE=2 more), T27=Purchase L3_84→15 points WIN! Opponent at 1 point, 7-point lead maintained. Reserving secures victory path, prevents opponent interference on critical 4-point card. EXECUTE RESERVE L3_84!

======================================================================================

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Critical position: Opponent at 8 points with reserved 9 more points, but cannot afford any face-up cards currently (lack WHITE/GREEN tokens). I have 1 point and urgently need to accelerate scoring while securing scarce resources.

Current board scarcity: RED=1 token available (critical for my engine), WHITE=1, GREEN=4, BLUE=3, BLACK=0. I must seize the scarce RED token now before opponent takes it.

With my bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2), I cannot purchase any cards this turn - all require RED or GREEN tokens I lack. Taking 3 different tokens is optimal since I'm at 6 tokens (under the 10-token limit).

Taking RED=1, GREEN=1, BLUE=1 is superior to other combinations:
1. **Secures scarce RED** (only 1 remains on board) - essential for L2_54 (1PP), L2_59 (1PP), L2_65 (1PP)
2. **Enables immediate next-turn purchase**: After taking these tokens, I'll have RED=1, BLACK=2, allowing me to purchase L2_65 (costs RED=1, BLACK=1) next turn, reaching 2PP total
3. **Positions for multiple paths**: GREEN+BLUE progress toward Level 3 cards (L3_85=4PP, L3_86=5PP) while maintaining flexibility
4. **Better than GREEN=2**: Taking 2 GREEN would miss the crucial RED token and delay scoring by at least one turn
5. **Token count safe**: After taking 3 tokens, I'll be at 9 total, staying under limit

This move efficiently builds toward immediate points (L2_65 next turn), secures the scarce RED resource, and maintains flexibility for both Level 2 and Level 3 strategies while opponent struggles to afford their reserved cards.

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=5, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current: 8 points, RED=3+BLACK=2+GOLD=1 (6 tokens), WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=2+BLACK=1 bonuses, 3/3 reserved (L2_63, L3_82, L3_84). Following optimized path to L3_79 (3 points, gives WHITE bonus, costs effective BLUE=2+GREEN=3+RED=3+BLACK=2). I already have RED=3✓+BLACK=2✓ perfectly matching L3_79 requirements! Just need BLUE=2+GREEN=3. With GOLD=1, I can substitute 1 color → collect BLUE=2+GREEN=2, use GOLD for GREEN=1 → total BLUE=2+GREEN=3✓. Board has BLUE=2+GREEN=3 available. OPTIMAL ACTION: Take BLUE=1+GREEN=1+WHITE=1 (valid 3-color rule, board shows BLUE=2≥1✓+GREEN=3≥1✓+WHITE=1≥1✓) → tokens become RED=3+BLACK=2+GOLD=1+BLUE=1+GREEN=1+WHITE=1 (9 total, under 10 limit, no return needed✓). Timeline: T20=this token collection (9 tokens), T21=Take BLUE=1+GREEN=1+other → BLUE=2+GREEN=2 total (10 tokens), T22=Purchase L3_79 paying RED=3+BLACK=2+BLUE=2+GREEN=2+GOLD=1 → 11 points+WHITE=2 bonus. Then T23-25 collect BLUE=6, T26 purchase L3_84 → 15 points WIN! Considered purchasing L2_65 (1 point, costs effective WHITE=1+BLACK=2, affordable with GOLD=1+BLACK=2) but delays overall timeline by 1-2 turns: would give 9 points+RED=3 bonus but then still need full L3_79 collection (BLUE=2+GREEN=3+BLACK=2 takes 3+ turns) + L3_84 collection → total ~7-8 turns vs token path 6 turns. Token collection is fastest route to victory. Opponent at 1 point, maintaining 7-point lead.

======================================================================================

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current critical position: Opponent at 8PP with 11PP in reserve (L2_63=2, L3_84=4, L3_82=5). I have 1PP and must score immediately.

Token availability is extremely limited: only BLUE=1, GREEN=2, GOLD=4 on board. Opponent cannot take valid token combinations (cannot take 3 different colors, cannot take 2 same-color as no pile has 4+ tokens).

With my bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2) and tokens (WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2), I can purchase:
- L2_65 costs RED=2, BLACK=3 → after bonuses: RED=1, BLACK=1 (I have exactly RED=1, BLACK=2)
- L1_17 costs GREEN=1 (I have GREEN=1) but gives 0PP
- All other cards require tokens I lack

L2_65 is the ONLY card that scores this turn. Purchasing it:
1. Scores immediate 1PP (moving to 2PP total)
2. Increases RED bonus to 2, strengthening my engine
3. Leaves me at 7 tokens (WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=1), well under limit
4. Opponent cannot respond with a scoring play (they cannot afford any point cards this turn)
5. Denies opponent a RED bonus card they might target later

Delaying this purchase would be catastrophic - opponent could score next turn if board refreshes, while I remain at 1PP. This is the only viable path to maintain competitive tempo.

Reasoning: I'm at 8 points with BLUE=1+GREEN=1+RED=3+BLACK=2+GOLD=1+WHITE=1 (9 tokens), bonuses WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=2+BLACK=1, 3/3 reserved. My optimal path to 15 points is: T21 collect final tokens for L3_79, T22 purchase L3_79 (11 points), T23-26 collect BLUE=6, T27 purchase L3_84 (15 points WIN). L3_79 costs BLUE=3+GREEN=3+RED=5+BLACK=3 raw, with my bonuses = effective BLUE=2+GREEN=3+RED=3+BLACK=2. I already have RED=3✓+BLACK=2✓ perfectly matching requirements! Just need BLUE=1+GREEN=2 more tokens (or use GOLD=1 to substitute 1 GREEN). Board has BLUE=1✓+GREEN=2✓+RED=1✓ available. Taking BLUE=1+GREEN=1+RED=1 (valid 3 different colors rule) → tokens become BLUE=2+GREEN=2+RED=4+BLACK=2+GOLD=1+WHITE=1 = 12 total, exceeds 10 limit. Must return 2 tokens. Return WHITE=1 (not needed for L3_79 which has no WHITE cost) + RED=1 (keeping RED=3 which is exactly what L3_79 needs) → final: BLUE=2+GREEN=2+RED=3+BLACK=2+GOLD=1 = 10 tokens perfectly positioned. T22: Purchase L3_79 paying BLUE=2+GREEN=2+GOLD(as GREEN)+RED=3+BLACK=2 = all 10 tokens → 11 points+WHITE bonus. Then T23-26 collect BLUE=6 tokens (board will refresh), T27 purchase L3_84 → 15 points WIN! Considered purchasing L2_54 (1 point, costs effective WHITE=1+BLUE=2+RED=1, I can afford with GOLD) but this delays overall timeline: would give 9 points but then need 3-4 turns collecting for L3_79, reaching 15 points Turn 30 vs Turn 27 with token path. Considered purchasing L1_30 (GREEN bonus, costs BLUE=1) but also delays by 1 turn to T28. Token collection is FASTEST route! Opponent at 2 points, could purchase L3_85 by T23 for 6 points. I maintain crushing lead: 11 points vs 6 points by T22, then 15 vs 6 by T27. Token path secures victory in 6 turns!

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Critical analysis: Opponent at 8PP with 11PP in reserve (L2_63=2, L3_84=4, L3_82=5). They cannot afford any face-up cards due to scarce resources (no BLUE tokens, limited WHITE/GREEN). I have 2PP and must accelerate while denying resources.

Token scarcity is extreme: only WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 available. Opponent needs WHITE for L3_82 (5PP), GREEN for L2_63 (2PP), and RED for general flexibility. Taking all three denies their entire scoring path.

My optimal target is L3_78 (5PP). Current cost after bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=3): needs WHITE=4 tokens. I have WHITE=3 tokens. By taking WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 now:
1. Reaches exactly 10 tokens (no discards)
2. Secures the final WHITE needed for L3_78 next turn
3. Denies opponent all scarce resources simultaneously
4. Creates multiple fallback options: can buy L2_54 (1PP), L2_59 (1PP), or L2_42 (1PP) if L3_78 is replaced
5. Opponent cannot respond effectively - they're stuck at 8PP with no viable token takes (no 4+ pile)

This move combines resource denial, optimal positioning for a 5-point swing, and maintains perfect token efficiency while opponent's engine stagnates.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 22 - EXECUTE THE PURCHASE! Current status: 8 points, BLUE=2+GREEN=2+RED=3+BLACK=2+GOLD=1 (10 tokens), WHITE=1+BLUE=1+RED=2+BLACK=1 bonuses, 3/3 reserved. L3_79 (3 points, WHITE bonus) costs BLUE=3+GREEN=3+RED=5+BLACK=3 raw. With my bonuses, effective cost = BLUE=2+GREEN=3+RED=3+BLACK=2. I have EXACTLY the tokens needed: BLUE=2✓+GREEN=2+GOLD=1(substitute for 1 GREEN)=total GREEN=3✓+RED=3✓+BLACK=2✓. PERFECT MATCH! This purchase: (1) Scores 3 points→11 total, maintaining 9-point lead over opponent's 2 points, (2) Gains WHITE bonus→total WHITE=2 (powerful for future), (3) Reduces tokens to 0 (board has no colored tokens anyway, only BLACK=1+GOLD=4, so having tokens is useless this turn), (4) Positions me for final L3_84 purchase (need 4 more points to reach 15). After this, I'll collect BLUE=6 tokens over 4-5 turns then purchase L3_84 (costs BLUE=7 raw - BLUE=1 bonus = BLUE=6 effective) for 4 points→15 points WIN! Opponent will likely purchase L3_78 (5 points, costs effective WHITE=4 which they have) next turn→7 points, but they'd still need 8 more points vs my 4. Board will refresh with tokens from their purchase. This is the exact turn I planned in my Turn 21 reasoning. Verified L3_79 is face-up on board✓ (not reserved by opponent, still available). NO OTHER OPTION: Can't take tokens (board empty except BLACK=1), can't reserve (3/3 full), other purchasable cards give 0-1 points vs L3_79's 3 points. EXECUTE PURCHASE L3_79!

======================================================================================

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=7, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Opponent has 11PP with 11 more in reserve (L2_63=2, L3_82=5, L3_84=4) and can reach 15+ quickly if they collect needed tokens. I have only 2PP and must score rapidly. 

L3_78 (5PP) is my highest-value target. Cost after bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=3): needs WHITE=4 tokens. I have exactly WHITE=4. Purchasing it now gives 5PP (total 7PP) and leaves me at 6 tokens, allowing a token take next turn.

Post-purchase plan:
1. Next turn: Take BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 to deny opponent's key resources (they need BLUE=6, GREEN=5, BLACK=5 for their reserved cards). This brings me to 9 tokens and sets up L3_85.
2. Following turn: Purchase L3_85 (4PP) using BLUE=2, GREEN=3 (cost after bonuses: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3). Score reaches 11PP.
3. Final turn sequence: Purchase L2_54 (1PP) for RED=1 (cost after bonuses). This gives WHITE bonus, reaching WHITE=4. Claim noble N1 (3PP) with BLUE=4, WHITE=4. Total score: 11+1+3=15PP.

This 3-turn path to victory is optimal. L3_78 is the only card that provides 5PP immediately. Alternatives like L3_83 (3PP) are slower. Risks: Opponent could reserve L2_54, but fallback exists via L1_17 (WHITE bonus) if needed. Token denial is critical to slow opponent's collection of BLUE/GREEN/BLACK for their reserved cards.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 23 - Successfully purchased L3_79 last turn! Now at 11 points with 0 tokens, need 4 more points to reach 15 and WIN. Reserved cards: L2_63 (needs GREEN=5), L3_82 (needs effective WHITE=1+BLACK=6), L3_84 (needs effective BLUE=6). L3_84 is the FASTEST path to victory: collect BLUE=6 over 3-4 turns, then purchase for 4 points→15 points WIN! Board has BLUE=2+GREEN=2+RED=3+BLACK=3+WHITE=4+GOLD=5. Opponent at 7 points with strong bonuses (WHITE=3+BLUE=4+RED=2+BLACK=2) threatens L3_77 (needs WHITE=3+BLACK=1 effective, has BLACK=1) or L3_85 (needs BLUE=2+GREEN=3 effective, has BLUE=2+GREEN=2) for 4 points→11 points in 1-2 turns. But opponent would still need 4+ more points after that, taking 2-3 additional turns. My timeline: T23 collect BLUE=1 (+ extras), T24 collect more BLUE, T25 collect more BLUE, T26 purchase L3_84→15 points WIN! (4 turns total). Opponent needs 2 turns to 11 points + 2-3 turns to 15→total 4-5 turns. I WIN THE RACE! This turn: take BLUE=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 (valid 3 different colors, all available on board✓, starts my BLUE=6 collection path). BLACK=1 also provides backup flexibility for L3_82 plan if needed (costs effective WHITE=1+BLACK=6). Tokens become 3 total (under 10 limit, no returns needed). Execute token collection!

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=6, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Critical position: Opponent has 11PP with 11 more in reserve (L2_63=2, L3_82=5, L3_84=4). I have 7PP and must accelerate scoring immediately. Analysis of affordable cards shows L3_85 (4PP) is purchasable now - after applying my bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=4, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2), the cost is BLUE=2, GREEN=1, which I have exactly. Purchasing L3_85 moves me to 11PP and creates a guaranteed 2-turn win path: next turn I purchase L2_54 for 1PP (costs RED=1 after bonuses), reaching 12PP and gaining WHITE=4 bonus, then claim Noble N1 for 3PP to reach 15PP. Opponent cannot purchase any face-up cards this turn (all unaffordable with their current tokens/bonuses) and cannot reserve more cards (already at max). This is the fastest, most efficient scoring play that denies opponent any counterplay while securing victory.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L3_85]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L3_85
Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 7PP, opponent has 11PP with 11PP in reserve. I need 8 more points to win.

My bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=4, RED=2, BLACK=2
My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1

**Critical Discovery: L2_54 purchase triggers immediate Noble claim**

L2_54 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=3, RED=3. After my bonuses, this costs only RED=1 (which I have exactly).

Upon purchasing L2_54:
1. Score increases to 8PP (7+1)
2. WHITE bonus increases to 4
3. With BLUE=4 and WHITE=4, I immediately satisfy Noble N1 (BLUE=4, WHITE=4)
4. Noble N1 gives +3PP → Total score: 11PP

This positions me perfectly for a 2-turn win:
- Next turn I can purchase L3_85 (4PP) using my remaining BLUE=2, GREEN=1 tokens
- Final score: 11PP + 4PP = 15PP → VICTORY

Alternative analysis:
- L3_85 now: Need BLUE=2, GREEN=1 (have BLUE=2, GREEN=2) BUT also need to pay GREEN=3 total after bonuses, so I'm short by 1 GREEN token
- L2_44: Would give 9PP but delays noble and doesn't guarantee faster win
- Taking tokens: Slower when immediate scoring+purchasing is available

Opponent cannot interfere with this plan - they lack the resources to purchase any high-value cards this turn. This move efficiently combines scoring, noble acquisition, and sets up guaranteed victory next turn.

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL: Tied 11-11! Analyzing win conditions: Opponent can win T27 via L3_85 (4 pts, effective BLUE=2+GREEN=3 after their WHITE=4+BLUE=4 bonuses, they currently have BLUE=2+GREEN=2 tokens) by taking GREEN=1 on T25 then purchasing T27. OR via L3_77 (4 pts, effective WHITE=2+BLACK=1 after bonuses, they have BLACK=1) by taking WHITE=2 on T25 then purchasing T27. My L3_84 path needs BLUE=6 effective (have BLUE=1, need 5 more) = minimum 3 turns collecting then 1 turn purchasing = T30+ earliest. I lose race by 3+ turns. Blocking attempts fail: (1) Can't reserve to block L3_85/L3_77 (3/3 reserved slots full), (2) Taking WHITE=2 to delay L3_77 doesn't work (opponent switches to L3_85 path), (3) Taking GREEN doesn't work (opponent does L3_77 instead). No purchasable cards give 4 points now. BEST MOVE: Progress toward L3_84, take BLUE=1+GREEN=1+RED=1 (valid 3 different colors, board has BLUE=1✓+GREEN=2✓+RED=3✓). Results in BLUE=2+GREEN=1+RED=2+BLACK=1 (6 tokens, under 10 limit, no returns). BLUE=2 advances L3_84 path (need 4 more), GREEN=1 provides L2_63 backup option. Opponent highly likely wins T27, but this maximizes my position.

======================================================================================

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=6, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 11 prestige points and need just 4 more to win. Analyzing my purchase options:

**L3_85 (4PP)** is on the board and I can afford it:
- Cost: WHITE=3, BLUE=6, GREEN=3
- My bonuses: WHITE=4, BLUE=4, GREEN=2
- Effective cost: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1
- My tokens: BLUE=2, GREEN=2 ✓

Purchasing L3_85 will give me exactly 4PP, reaching 15PP and winning immediately. No other action canbeat this.

Alternative checks:
- Opponent has 11PP with reserved cards totaling 11PP, but cannot afford any this turn
- Board token scarcity (BLUE=0, GREEN=1) limits opponent's options
- Even if opponent could win next turn, winning now is strictly dominant

This is a guaranteed winning move with zero risk.

**Final decision**: Purchase L3_85 for 4PP to reach 15PP and win the game.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L3_85]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L3_85
Reasoning: I have 11 prestige points and need just 4 more to win. Analyzing my options:

1) Current token count: 5 total (BLUE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=1, WHITE=0, RED=0)
2) Target cards for 4+ points:
   - L3_77 (4PP): After my bonuses (WHITE=4, BLUE=4, BLACK=2), costs WHITE=2, BLACK=1. I have BLACK=1 already, need WHITE=2.
   - L3_85 (4PP): After bonuses, costs BLUE=2, GREEN=3. I have BLUE=2, GREEN=2 (need 1 more GREEN).
   - L3_86 (5PP): After bonuses, costs BLUE=3, GREEN=3. I have BLUE=2, GREEN=2 (need 1 more BLUE, 1 more GREEN).

3) Board token supply: WHITE=4, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2
   - I can take 2 WHITE tokens (4+ available)
   - I cannot take 2 of any other color (none have 4+)
   - I can take 3 different colors, but that delays my win

4) Optimal move: Take 2 WHITE tokens now. This sets up an immediate winning purchase of L3_77 next turn for 4PP, reaching exactly 15PP.

5) Risk mitigation: Even if opponent reserves L3_77 this turn, I can pivot to L3_85 (need GREEN=1) or L3_86 (need BLUE=1, GREEN=1) next turn. Both are still viable paths to victory.

6) Token limit safety: I have 5 tokens + taking 2 = 7 tokens, well under the 10-token limit. No returns needed.

Taking WHITE=2 is the most direct, efficient path to victory while also denying opponent access to WHITE tokens they need for their reserved L3_82 (5PP) card.

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 25 - CRITICAL SITUATION: Tied 11-11, opponent (WHITE=4+BLUE=4+RED=2+BLACK=2 bonuses, WHITE=2+BLUE=2+GREEN=2+BLACK=1 tokens) can purchase L3_77 (4 points, costs WHITE=6+BLUE=3+BLACK=3) on their next turn for immediate 15-11 victory. With their bonuses, L3_77 effective cost = WHITE=2+BLUE=0(covered)+BLACK=1. They have EXACTLY these tokens: WHITE=2✓+BLACK=1✓. I CANNOT prevent this: (1) Can't reserve L3_77 (3/3 slots full), (2) Can't purchase it myself (costs effective WHITE=4+BLUE=2+BLACK=2 with my bonuses, I have WHITE=0+BLUE=2+BLACK=1 = missing WHITE=4), (3) Can't deny tokens (they already possess what's needed). My paths all blocked: L3_84 needs BLUE=6 effective (have BLUE=2, board has BLUE=0 available), L3_82 needs WHITE=1+BLACK=6 effective (have WHITE=0+BLACK=1), L2_63 needs GREEN=4 effective (have GREEN=1). No face-up cards give me 4+ points to win. Game effectively LOST on Turn 26. OPTIMAL MOVE: Purchase L1_38 (0 points, RED bonus, costs WHITE=2+RED=2 raw). With my bonuses WHITE=2+RED=2, effective cost = WHITE=0+RED=0 = COMPLETELY FREE! This preserves all my tokens (stay at BLUE=2+GREEN=1+RED=2+BLACK=1=6 total) while gaining RED=3 bonus (vs L1_30 costing BLUE=1, L1_17 costing GREEN=1, L1_35 costing GREEN=1+BLACK=1). Free purchase is mathematically optimal in losing position. Verified L1_38 on board✓. Executing.

======================================================================================

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=6, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Analysis of winning move:

Current state: 11 prestige points, need 4 more to reach 15 and win.

My resources:
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=1 (total 7)
- Bonuses: WHITE=4, BLUE=4, RED=2, BLACK=2

Face-up Level 3 cards:
- L3_77: 4 prestige points, bonus BLUE, cost {WHITE:6, BLUE:3, BLACK:3}

Cost calculation for L3_77 after applying bonuses:
- WHITE: 6 - 4 = 2 tokens needed
- BLUE: 3 - 4 = 0 tokens needed (bonus covers it)
- BLACK: 3 - 2 = 1 token needed

I have exactly: WHITE=2, BLACK=1. This is a perfect match.

Purchase outcome:
1. Spend WHITE=2, BLACK=1 (remaining tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=0)
2. Gain 4 prestige points (11 + 4 = 15)
3. Reach 15 prestige points → immediate victory
4. Gain BLUE bonus (increases to BLUE=5)

This is the optimal winning move. No other action can achieve victory faster. Taking tokens would delay the win and risk opponent reaching 15 first (they also have 11PP). Alternative purchases (L3_85, L3_83, L3_86) require more tokens or give fewer points, delaying victory.

Conclusion: Purchase L3_77 now for immediate win.

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 26 - OPPONENT HAS WON: Opponent reached 15 points last turn (Turn 25) by purchasing L3_77, bringing them from 11→15 points. I'm at 11 points with BLUE=2+GREEN=1+RED=2+BLACK=1 (6 tokens), bonuses WHITE=2+BLUE=1+RED=3+BLACK=1, 3/3 reserved. According to Splendor rules, when a player reaches 15 points, the round completes so all players have equal turns. This is my final turn. CAN I WIN? My reserved cards: L3_84 (4 pts, needs effective BLUE=6, I have BLUE=2 → SHORT 4 tokens, board has BLUE=0 available), L2_63 (2 pts, needs GREEN=5 effective → SHORT 4), L3_82 (5 pts, needs effective WHITE=1+BLACK=6 → SHORT 6). Face-up cards with 3+ points: L3_86 (5 pts, needs effective BLUE=6+GREEN=3 → SHORT 7), L3_85 (4 pts, needs 9 tokens → SHORT 3), L3_83 (3 pts, needs 8 effective tokens → SHORT 4), L3_73 (4 pts, needs GREEN=3+RED=3+BLACK=2 → SHORT 4). NONE AFFORDABLE. Best face-up: L2_44 (2 pts, needs GREEN=5 → SHORT 4), L2_50 (2 pts, needs effective BLACK=3 → SHORT 2). CANNOT REACH 15 POINTS THIS TURN. Opponent wins 15-11. BEST ENDGAME MOVE: Purchase cheapest available card to gain bonus efficiently. L1_17 (0 pts, WHITE bonus) costs BLUE=1+GREEN=1+RED=1+BLACK=1 raw, with my bonuses (BLUE=1+RED=3+BLACK=1 cover those colors) = effective GREEN=1 only. I have GREEN=1✓. This is tied for cheapest card available (L1_13 also costs 1 token) and gains WHITE=3 total bonus. While it doesn't change outcome, it demonstrates proper play by spending tokens productively rather than wasting turn collecting unused tokens. Verified L1_17 on board✓. Executing dignified final purchase.
