Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Opening turn strategy: I need to establish a flexible token base for my engine. Taking 3 different colored tokens (WHITE, GREEN, BLACK) provides maximum optionality for purchasing multiple Level 1 cards. Current board analysis: All token colors have 4 available, so this move is legal. Token count: Currently 0, taking 3 puts me at 3 total (well under the 10 limit, no returns needed). This combination positions me for several efficient paths: (1) L1_14 (BLUE bonus for GREEN 2, BLACK 2) - I'll be halfway there with GREEN 1, BLACK 1; (2) L1_39 (RED bonus for WHITE 3) - I'll have 1/3 of the cost; (3) L1_24 (WHITE bonus + 1 point for GREEN 4) - I'll have 1/4 of the cost. The key principle is avoiding early commitment while maintaining access to cheap bonuses that compound into bigger purchases. WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK are core colors appearing frequently in affordable Level 1 cards, making this the most strategically sound opening move.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: As Player 1 with no tokens or cards, I need to acquire tokens to start purchasing cards. Taking 3 different tokens is optimal because it maximizes token acquisition (3 tokens vs. 2 for taking duplicates) and provides flexibility. I choose WHITE, BLUE, and RED because they align with the cost of L1_3 (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1), an affordable Level 1 card that gives a BLACK bonus. This sets me up for an early purchase. All chosen colors have sufficient board supply (WHITE:3, BLUE:4, RED:4), and I have 0 tokens, so no risk of exceeding 10. Avoiding reserving or purchasing now as token accumulation is priority early game.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 2 strategy: My goal is to purchase L1_14 next turn (BLUE bonus costing GREEN 2, BLACK 2). I currently have GREEN 1, BLACK 1, so I need exactly 1 more of each. Since the rules require taking 3 different colored tokens, I'm choosing GREEN, BLACK, and WHITE. This brings me to: WHITE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 2 (6 tokens total, well under the limit). Next turn I'll purchase L1_14, leaving me with WHITE 2 and a BLUE bonus. This sets up a clean path to L1_39 (RED bonus, costs WHITE 3) - I'll only need WHITE 1 more. By turn 5, I'll have both BLUE and RED bonuses, which significantly reduce costs for valuable Level 2 cards. For example, L2_55 (WHITE bonus, 2 points) costs GREEN 1, RED 4, BLACK 2, but with my RED bonus it becomes GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2. WHITE is also crucial for multiple high-value Level 3 cards (L3_82 and L3_85). While my opponent appears positioned for L1_3, my path focuses on the efficient BLUE→RED bonus combo that enables mid-game scoring.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: I need to accumulate tokens to afford cards. I currently have 3 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1). Taking 3 different tokens will bring me to 6, which is safe and efficient. I aim to purchase L1_3, which costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1. I already have 1 of each, so I need 1 more WHITE, 1 more BLUE, and no more RED (since I already meet the RED requirement). However, looking at the board, WHITE only has 1 token available, so I cannot take WHITE if I need 1 more (since taking WHITE requires at least 1 available, but I want to take 3 different colors). Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN, because GREEN is useful for other cards (like L1_24 which costs GREEN:4 and gives 1 prestige, or L2_48 which needs GREEN). Checking token availability: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:2. All have at least 1, so I can take one of each. This gives me WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, plus my existing RED:1, BLACK:0. That sets me up to buy L1_3 next turn (needs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1) and also start accumulating GREEN for future purchases. Another option is to take 2 tokens of the same color, but taking 3 different is better for flexibility. I could also consider reserving a card, but since I have only 3 tokens, I should accumulate more first. Purchasing is not possible yet because I don't have enough tokens for any card. So, taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN is a solid choice.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 3 execution: According to my multi-turn plan, I'm now purchasing L1_14 (BLUE bonus, costs GREEN 2, BLACK 2). Verification: (1) Card exists on board ✓ (2) I have exactly GREEN 2, BLACK 2 ✓ (3) No bonuses needed ✓. This purchase is on schedule and strategically sound. After this move, I'll have WHITE 2 and a BLUE bonus. Critical board observation: WHITE tokens are at 0, so my original plan to take WHITE 1 next turn for L1_39 needs adjustment. Instead, my revised plan is: Turn 4: Take BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1 (all available on board) → total WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, plus BLUE bonus. Turn 5: Purchase L1_3 (costs WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1, but with BLUE bonus becomes WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 1) → gain BLACK bonus. This modified path still achieves the BLUE→BLACK bonus combo within 5 turns, which enables efficient Level 2 purchases. The opponent took WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, possibly setting up for L1_3, but I'll reach it first with my BLUE bonus advantage.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1. I aimed to purchase L1_3 (cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1). I have exactly those tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1. Purchasing this card now will give me a BLACK bonus and free up tokens (spending them). This is efficient because it uses my accumulated tokens to gain a bonus and progress toward points. After purchase, my tokens will be: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, and I'll have 1 BLACK bonus. This leaves me with only 1 token (GREEN), allowing me to take more tokens next turn without risk of exceeding 10. Purchasing is better than taking tokens because it advances my engine and reduces token count, avoiding the need to return tokens later. Also, L1_3 is available on the board (face-up). No need to reserve or take tokens now.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1}
Reasoning: Turn 4 strategic analysis: My opponent purchased L1_3 (BLACK bonus) last turn, invalidating my original plan to buy it. I need to pivot. Current state: WHITE 2, BLUE 1 bonus. Available Level 1 cards analysis: (1) L1_26 (GREEN bonus) costs WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 2 with my BLUE bonus - I already have WHITE 2, so I need RED 1, BLACK 2; (2) L1_22 (WHITE bonus) costs BLUE 1, BLACK 2 - I need BLUE 1, BLACK 2; (3) L1_39 (RED bonus) costs WHITE 3 - I need WHITE 1 but can't take it legally since board only has WHITE 2. Strategic comparison: GREEN bonus vs WHITE bonus. Looking at high-value cards: L2_55 (2 points) with GREEN bonus costs RED 4, BLACK 2 instead of GREEN 1, RED 4, BLACK 2 - saves 1 token. L3_85 (4 points) with GREEN bonus costs WHITE 3, BLUE 5, GREEN 2 instead of WHITE 3, BLUE 6, GREEN 3 - saves 1 token. GREEN also appears in 2 of 3 nobles (N2 needs GREEN 4, RED 4; N9 needs GREEN 3, RED 3, BLUE 3). WHITE appears in 0 nobles. GREEN bonus is clearly superior for this board state. Path to L1_26: Turn 4 (now): Take RED 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1 → WHITE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 (5 total, legal). Turn 5: Take BLACK 2 → WHITE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 3 (6 total). Turn 6: Purchase L1_26 using WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, gaining GREEN bonus. This positions me with BLUE 1, GREEN 1 bonuses for efficient Level 2 purchases. Board verification: RED 4 available ✓, GREEN 3 available ✓, BLACK 4 available ✓. Taking 3 different colors at 1 each is legal. Total tokens: 2 → 5 (under limit, no returns needed).

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with only 1 GREEN token and 1 BLACK bonus. No face-up cards are immediately affordable with my current resources, so I need to accumulate tokens to pursue future purchases. Taking 3 different tokens is the most efficient action, granting 3 tokens versus 2 for taking duplicates. I choose GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK because they align with potential targets: L1_24 (costs GREEN:4, gives 1 prestige and WHITE bonus) and L2_48 (costs BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3, with my BLACK bonus reducing the BLACK cost). All selected colors have at least 1 token available on the board (GREEN:2, BLUE:4, BLACK:3). After this action, I will have 4 tokens total (GREEN:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1), which is well under the 10-token limit, so no tokens need to be returned. This move builds flexibility and progress toward scoring points.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 5 critical strategic pivot: After analyzing both paths, I'm switching from my original GREEN bonus plan to a faster WHITE bonus path. Here's why: If I take BLUE 1, BLACK 1, GREEN 1 (all available on board), I'll have WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 2 (8 tokens, legal). Turn 6: Purchase L1_22 (costs BLUE 1, BLACK 2 with BLUE bonus) → remaining WHITE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1 with BLUE 1, WHITE 1 bonuses. Turn 7: Purchase L1_39 (costs WHITE 2 with WHITE bonus) IMMEDIATELY without taking more tokens → remaining GREEN 2, RED 1 with BLUE 1, WHITE 1, RED 1 bonuses. This gives me 3 bonuses by turn 7 vs only 2 bonuses by turn 8 in the GREEN path! Speed matters: The WHITE→RED chain allows me to purchase L2_55 (2 points) faster because RED bonus reduces its cost from GREEN 1, RED 4, BLACK 2 to GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 (same savings as GREEN bonus). After L2_55, I'll have BLUE 1, WHITE 2, RED 1 bonuses, positioning me perfectly for L3_82 (5 points, costs WHITE 1, BLACK 7 with WHITE 2). This tempo advantage is decisive - building bonuses one turn faster compounds into reaching 15 points multiple turns faster. My previous GREEN plan was solid but slower. Board verification: BLUE 3✓, BLACK 2✓, GREEN 1✓ all available. Token math: 5→8 total (under limit, no returns).

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 0 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 0 RED, 1 BLACK tokens (total 4) and 1 BLACK bonus. I need to accumulate tokens to afford cards. I can purchase L1_24 (cost GREEN:4, gives 1 prestige and WHITE bonus) but need 2 more GREEN tokens. I also aim for L2_48 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3) which aligns with my BLACK bonus. Currently, I have GREEN:2, need 1 more; BLUE:1, need 1 more; BLACK:1, need 2 more. Taking tokens efficiently: I could take 3 different colors. Available tokens on board: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:1. GREEN has 0 available, so I cannot take GREEN. I could take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK: all have at least 1. Taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK would give me WHITE:1, BLUE:2, BLACK:2 after adding to current, plus existing GREEN:2, RED:0. That totals 5 tokens, well under 10. This sets me up for future purchases: L1_24 still needs GREEN but I can't take GREEN now; L2_48 needs BLUE:2 (I'll have 2), GREEN:3 (I have 2, need 1 more), BLACK:3 (I'll have 2, need 1 more). Alternatively, I could take 2 tokens of the same color, but only if 4+ available. BLUE has 2 available (not enough), RED has 3 (not enough), WHITE has 2, BLACK has 1. So taking duplicates is not possible. Therefore, taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK is the best legal move. It gives me tokens toward multiple goals and avoids reserving or purchasing prematurely.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 6 execution: Following my turn 5 plan precisely, I'm purchasing L1_22 (WHITE bonus, costs BLUE 2, BLACK 2). Verification: (1) Card exists on board ✓ (2) With BLUE 1 bonus, cost becomes BLUE 1, BLACK 2 (3) I have exactly BLUE 1, BLACK 2 ✓. This purchase is strategically crucial for two reasons: First, it keeps me on schedule for the fast 3-bonus path (BLUE→WHITE→RED by turn 7). Second, my opponent can also afford L1_22 (they have BLUE 2, BLACK 2, and their BLACK bonus reduces cost to BLUE 2, BLACK 1), so I must take it first. After this purchase, I'll have WHITE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1 (5 tokens) and BLUE 1, WHITE 1 bonuses. Turn 7: I can immediately purchase L1_39 for WHITE 2 (WHITE 3 cost minus WHITE 1 bonus) without taking more tokens, gaining RED bonus. By turn 7, I'll have 3 bonuses (BLUE, WHITE, RED) with only 0 points, but this engine enables efficient Level 2-3 purchases. For example, L2_55 (2 points) will cost GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 (with RED bonus), which I can gather quickly. The tempo advantage of having 3 bonuses by turn 7 vs my opponent's 1 bonus is decisive for the mid-game.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2 (total 7). I need to accumulate tokens to afford cards. I aim for L2_48 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3) which aligns with my BLACK bonus (reduces BLACK cost by 1, so I need BLACK:2 effectively). Currently I have BLUE:2 (enough), GREEN:2 (need 1 more), BLACK:2 (need 1 more effectively? Actually with my BLACK bonus of 1, the cost is 3 BLACK, so I need 3 - 1 = 2 BLACK tokens. I have 2 BLACK tokens, so I have enough BLACK already! Wait: I have 2 BLACK tokens and 1 BLACK bonus, so for a cost of BLACK:3, I can use 2 tokens and the bonus to cover it. So BLACK is satisfied. For GREEN I need 3, I have 2, need 1 more. For BLUE I need 2, I have 2, so BLUE is satisfied. So I only need 1 more GREEN token to afford L2_48. However, looking at the board, GREEN has 0 available tokens, so I cannot take GREEN. So I need to consider other options. I could purchase L1_24 (cost GREEN:4, gives 1 prestige and WHITE bonus). I have GREEN:2, need 2 more, but GREEN is 0 on board, so I cannot take GREEN. So L1_24 is not immediately feasible. I could consider other cards: L1_26 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2) gives GREEN bonus. I have WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:0, BLACK:2. So I need 1 RED. I could take RED tokens. Available tokens on board: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2. I could take RED, WHITE, and BLACK? But I already have BLACK:2, and taking BLACK would give me 3, which is okay. But my priority should be to get cards that give points. L1_26 gives 0 points but a GREEN bonus. That's not great. L1_17 gives WHITE bonus, cost BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I have BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2. So I need 1 RED. Again, I could take RED. L1_39 costs WHITE:3, gives RED bonus, 0 points. I have WHITE:1, need 2 more WHITE. But WHITE only has 1 on board, so cannot take 2 WHITE. Taking duplicates not possible because WHITE has only 1 available. So I think the best move is to take tokens that set me up for future purchases and maybe deny my opponent. My opponent (Player 0) has tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0 and bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1. They might be aiming for something. I should consider taking tokens they might need. But I should focus on my own engine. Since I am close to L2_48 (needs only 1 GREEN), but GREEN is unavailable, I could reserve L2_48 to secure it and get a gold token. However, reserving would use an action and I have no reserved cards yet. But reserving L2_48 would guarantee I can buy it later when I get the GREEN token. Also, reserving gives me a gold token, which can substitute for the missing GREEN. That might be a good move because then I can purchase L2_48 next turn using gold as GREEN. Let's check: If I reserve L2_48, I get 1 gold token (if available, there are 5 gold). Then my tokens become: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1. Total 8 tokens. Then next turn I can purchase L2_48 using: cost BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3. My bonuses: BLACK:1, so need BLACK tokens: 2. I have BLACK:2, good. BLUE:2, I have BLUE:2, good. GREEN:3, I have GREEN:2 and 1 gold, so I can use gold as the third GREEN. So I can purchase it next turn! That gives me 1 point and a BLUE bonus. That seems very efficient. Alternatively, I could take tokens now to try to afford something else, but with GREEN unavailable, I might take RED, WHITE, BLACK? That would give me RED:1, WHITE:2, BLACK:3, plus existing. Then I could afford L1_26 or L1_17, but they give 0 points. Not great. Reserving L2_48 seems superior because it leads to a point next turn. Also, reserving denies my opponent that card. Let's verify: L2_48 is face-up, so I can reserve it by setting card_id="L2_48". That's a valid action. So I'll do that. But wait: I need to consider if taking tokens might be better for long-term. L2_48 is only 1 point, but it gives a BLUE bonus, which could help with nobles (N9 requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). I currently have GREEN:2, RED:0, BLUE:2 (after buying L2_48, I'll have BLUE bonus:1, so BLUE total bonus:1, but nobles count bonuses, not tokens). Actually nobles count purchased card bonuses. So after buying L2_48, my bonuses: BLACK:1, BLUE:1. That's not helping much for N9. N9 requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3. I have no GREEN bonus, no RED bonus. So maybe not. Other nobles: N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4. I have BLACK:1, no RED. N2 requires GREEN:4, RED:4. Not close. So maybe I should focus on getting points from higher-level cards. Reserving L2_48 gives me a point, but maybe I should reserve a level 3 card instead? But level 3 cards are expensive and I'm far from them. Alternatively, I could take tokens to build toward a level 2 or 3 card. But given that I'm close to L2_48 and it gives a point, I think it's a solid move. Also, reserving gives me a gold token, which is useful. I'll reserve L2_48. Action: RESERVE_CARD with card_id L2_48. I need to ensure I don't exceed 10 tokens. Currently I have 7 tokens. Reserving gives +1 gold, so total 8. That's fine. So no returns needed. I'll go with that.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2 (total 7). Bonuses: BLACK:1. Purchased: L1_3. I need to accumulate tokens to afford cards. My current total tokens is 7 (WHITE1 + BLUE2 + GREEN2 + BLACK2 = 7). I can take up to 3 more tokens without exceeding 10, so I don't need to return any. I want to work towards purchasing L2_48 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3) which gives 1 prestige and a BLUE bonus. With my BLACK bonus of 1, the effective cost is BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:2. I currently have BLUE:2 (meets), GREEN:2 (need 1 more), BLACK:2 (meets). So I need 1 more GREEN. Alternatively, L1_24 (cost GREEN:4, gives 1 prestige and WHITE bonus) requires GREEN:4, I have GREEN:2, need 2 more. But GREEN tokens on board are 0, so I cannot take GREEN. So L1_24 is not immediately feasible via token taking. Another target is L1_26 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2) which gives GREEN bonus. I have WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:0, BLACK:2. I need 1 RED. That card gives 0 prestige but a GREEN bonus, which could be useful for future. Also L1_17 (cost BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) gives WHITE bonus. I have BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2. Need 1 RED. Both require RED. RED on board is 3, so I can take RED. I also consider L2_55 (cost GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2) gives WHITE bonus and 2 prestige. I have GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2. Need 4 RED, which is many. Not close. L3 cards are too expensive. So my short-term goals: get 1 more GREEN for L2_48, or get RED for L1_26 or L1_17. However, GREEN is unavailable on board (0). So I cannot take GREEN. Therefore, I should take tokens that advance me toward other cards. Taking 3 different colors is optimal. Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2. I cannot take GREEN. So I can take WHITE, BLUE, RED? But BLUE I already have 2, and taking BLUE would give me 3 BLUE, which is okay but not necessary for L2_48 (already have 2). However, taking BLUE could be useful for other cards or for future purchases. But note: if I take BLUE, I would have 3 BLUE tokens, and L2_48 only needs 2 BLUE, so I'd have an extra. That's fine. But also, taking BLACK would give me 3 BLACK, but L2_48 needs only 2 effective BLACK (3 cost - 1 bonus). So I already have 2 BLACK, taking another would be extra. But extra tokens can be used for other cards. However, I should consider that taking tokens that are not immediately needed might clutter my hand, but I have only 7 tokens, so I can take 3 more. But I need to be careful not to exceed 10. After taking 3, I'll have 10 exactly. That's okay, but then next turn I might need to purchase or return. So it's acceptable. Which colors to take? I could take WHITE, RED, BLACK. That gives me WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:3, plus existing BLUE:2, GREEN:2. That would help with L1_26 (needs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2) - I'd have all. And L1_17 (needs BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) - I'd have all. So that sets up multiple purchases. Alternatively, take WHITE, BLUE, RED: gives WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:1, plus GREEN:2, BLACK:2. That also helps with L1_26 and L1_17. Both are good. But note: taking BLUE when I already have 2 might be less efficient because BLUE is not needed for L2_48 (already have 2). However, BLUE could be useful for other cards. I think taking WHITE, RED, BLACK is better because it gives me RED which I lack, and BLACK which is useful for L2_48 (though I already have enough, but extra is okay). Also, WHITE is useful for many cards. Check token availability: WHITE:1 (so I can take 1), RED:3, BLACK:2. All have at least 1. So taking WHITE, RED, BLACK is legal. Alternatively, I could take 2 tokens of the same color if 4+ available. RED has 3, not enough. BLUE has 2, not enough. BLACK has 2, not enough. WHITE has 1. So taking duplicates is not possible. Therefore, I will take WHITE, RED, BLACK. This gives me flexibility to purchase L1_26 or L1_17 next turn, and still progress toward L2_48 (need GREEN). After this, I'll have 10 tokens total, so next turn I must purchase or reserve to avoid returning tokens. That's fine. I could also consider reserving a card now, but I have no reserved cards yet. Reserving L2_48 might be good to secure it, but I would get a gold token. However, I have 7 tokens, if I reserve I would get 1 gold, total tokens 8, still under 10. But reserving uses a turn and doesn't advance my board position immediately. Since I am close to purchasing some Level 1 cards, I prefer to take tokens now to enable a purchase next turn. So TAKE_TOKENS is the best action. Ensure I set exactly 3 colors to 1 each: take_WHITE=1, take_RED=1, take_BLACK=1. Others 0. No return needed because 7+3=10.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: Turn 7 execution: Following my multi-turn plan precisely, I'm purchasing L1_39 (RED bonus, costs WHITE 3). Verification: (1) Card exists on board ✓ (2) With WHITE 1 bonus, effective cost becomes WHITE 2 (3) I have exactly WHITE 2 ✓. This purchase completes my fast 3-bonus path on schedule. After this move, I'll have GREEN 2, RED 1 (3 tokens) and BLUE 1, WHITE 1, RED 1 bonuses with 0 points. Critical board observation: My opponent is at 10 tokens (the maximum limit), which severely constrains their options - they must either purchase a card or return tokens if taking new ones. This gives me a decisive tempo advantage. Post-purchase board state: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 0, RED 2, BLACK 1 available. Turn 8 strategy: I can take BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 (the only 3 different colors available) → total GREEN 2, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1 (6 tokens). Turn 9: Purchase L1_17 (costs GREEN 1, BLACK 1 after bonuses) to gain WHITE bonus → 4 total bonuses. This rapid bonus accumulation (4 bonuses by turn 9) positions me perfectly for efficient Level 2 purchases like L2_55 (2 points), which will cost only GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 with my RED bonus.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens, so taking tokens would require returning an equal number, wasting a turn. I can afford L1_26, which costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, and I have sufficient tokens. Purchasing L1_26 gives me a GREEN bonus, which reduces the effective cost of L2_48 (my primary target) from GREEN:3 to GREEN:2. After buying L1_26, my token count drops to 5, freeing up capacity to take tokens next turn. I'll then collect the missing BLUE:1 and BLACK:1 to afford L2_48, which gives 1 prestige and a BLUE bonus. This purchase advances my engine and sets up for future points efficiently.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 8—CRITICAL GREEN BOTTLENECK: Board has 0 GREEN tokens, blocking all purchases. Verification: Every affordable Level 1 card requires GREEN—L1_17 needs GREEN 1 (with my WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1 bonuses, base cost BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 becomes GREEN 1, BLACK 1). L1_10 needs GREEN 1. L1_28 needs GREEN 1. L1_24 needs GREEN 4. I cannot purchase ANY card this turn. Taking tokens won't help next turn unless GREEN miraculously reappears (unlikely—opponent also stuck, can't afford cards with RED 0). Solution: Reserve L2_55 achieves THREE critical goals: (1) Receive 1 GOLD token (substitutes for missing GREEN when purchasing L1_17 later). (2) Secure valuable 2-point card affordable with my bonuses—base cost GREEN 1, RED 4, BLACK 2, with RED 1 bonus becomes GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2. (3) Transition from pure engine-building (0 points) to scoring track. Post-reserve multi-turn plan: Turn 9: Take WHITE 1, BLUE 1, BLACK 1 (all available on board: WHITE 3, BLUE 3, BLACK 2) → total WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 1 (7 tokens, legal). Turn 10: Purchase L1_17 using GOLD 1 (for GREEN), BLACK 1 → gain WHITE 2 bonus. Turn 11-12: Gather RED 2, BLACK 2 (I'll have WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 1 after L1_17). Turn 13: Purchase L2_55 → score 2 points, gain WHITE 3 bonus total. This path provides tempo advantage: gold solves GREEN shortage, 2-point card starts scoring race, bonuses compound for efficient Level 3 purchases later. Opponent threat minimal (needs RED 1 to afford L1_17, has RED 0).

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2 (total 6). Bonuses: GREEN:1, BLACK:1. Purchased cards: L1_3 (BLACK bonus), L1_26 (GREEN bonus). Score: 0. I need to aim for L2_48 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3) which gives 1 prestige and BLUE bonus. Effective cost with bonuses: GREEN reduced by 1 (GREEN:2), BLACK reduced by 1 (BLACK:2), BLUE:2. I currently have BLUE:1 (need 1 more), GREEN:2 (need 0 more? Actually need 2 effective, but I have 2 tokens, so meets), BLACK:2 (meets). Wait: Effective cost GREEN:2, I have GREEN tokens 2, so I have exactly enough GREEN tokens. Effective cost BLACK:2, I have BLACK tokens 2, exactly enough. Effective cost BLUE:2, I have BLUE:1, need 1 more BLUE token. So I am 1 BLUE token away from purchasing L2_48. However, I also have 6 tokens total, so I can take up to 4 tokens without exceeding 10. I should take tokens to get that BLUE. But note: GREEN tokens on board are 0, so I cannot take GREEN. That's fine because I don't need more GREEN. BLUE on board: 3, so I can take BLUE. I could take 3 different tokens to maximize gain. Available tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2. Since I need BLUE, I should take BLUE. Also, I might consider taking WHITE and RED for future cards. Taking WHITE, BLUE, RED would give me WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1, plus existing GREEN:2, BLACK:2, total 9 tokens. That would set me up for L2_48 (have BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2) and also give me flexibility for other cards like L1_17 (needs BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) or L1_10 (needs WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1). However, I need to check if taking 3 tokens is legal: all selected colors must have at least 1 token on board. WHITE:3, BLUE:3, RED:3 all have >=1, so legal. Alternatively, I could take 2 BLUE tokens if 4+ available, but BLUE has 3, not enough. So taking 3 different is best. After taking WHITE, BLUE, RED, I will have 9 tokens total, leaving room for one more next turn. Then I can purchase L2_48 next turn. That seems efficient. I should avoid taking BLACK because I already have enough BLACK for L2_48, and extra tokens might clutter. But taking BLACK would give me 3 BLACK, which is okay but not necessary. I think taking WHITE, BLUE, RED is optimal. This also gives me RED which I currently lack, opening up more purchase options. Therefore, I will take WHITE, BLUE, RED. No return needed. Action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1, others 0.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 9—Executing WHITE bonus path: L1_17 is affordable and critical. Verification: (1) Card exists on board ✓ (2) Base cost BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1, with my WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1 bonuses becomes GREEN 1, BLACK 1 (3) I have GREEN 2, RED 1, GOLD 1, so I'll pay GREEN 1 and GOLD 1 (substitute for BLACK) ✓. Strategic importance: This gives me WHITE 2 bonus, positioning me perfectly for L3_82 (5 points, costs WHITE 3, BLACK 7 → with WHITE 2 becomes WHITE 1, BLACK 7). Opponent threat analysis: Opponent has BLUE 2, RED 1 and can afford L1_17 with their GREEN 1, BLACK 1 bonuses (reduces cost to BLUE 1, RED 1). If I don't buy now, opponent takes WHITE bonus and gains tempo advantage. Additionally, opponent can buy L2_48 (1 point, BLUE bonus) next turn using BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 2 (cost with their bonuses). Post-purchase state: I'll have WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 1 bonuses with GREEN 1, RED 1 tokens (2 total), setting up to gather BLACK tokens for L3_82 or RED/BLACK tokens for L2_55 (2 points, currently reserved). Using GOLD now is acceptable because it secures WHITE 2 bonus faster—the tempo gain outweighs preserving GOLD for later flexibility. Next turn plan: Take WHITE 1, BLACK 2 (board has WHITE 2, BLACK 2 available) to begin accumulating BLACK for L3_82.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2 (total 9). Bonuses: GREEN:1, BLACK:1. Purchased cards: L1_3 (BLACK bonus), L1_26 (GREEN bonus). Score: 0. I have been aiming for L2_48 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3) which gives 1 prestige and a BLUE bonus. With my bonuses, the effective cost is BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2. I currently have tokens: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2, exactly meeting the effective cost. I also have WHITE:2 and RED:1 which are not needed for this purchase. I have 9 tokens total, so after purchasing, I will have 9 - 6 = 3 tokens (since I spend 6 tokens: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2). That frees up capacity for future token grabs. Purchasing L2_48 now is optimal because it scores 1 point and gives a BLUE bonus, advancing my engine. It also reduces my token count, allowing me to take more tokens next turn. Other options: I could take tokens, but I already have 9 tokens and taking 3 would exceed 10, requiring me to return tokens. That would be inefficient. I could reserve a card, but that doesn't score points. I could purchase other cards like L1_10 (cost WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1) which gives BLUE bonus, but I already have BLUE bonus from L2_48 purchase, and L1_10 gives 0 points. L2_48 gives a point and is my target. Checking affordability: I need to verify I have enough tokens to cover the cost after bonuses. Cost: BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3. Bonuses: GREEN:1, BLACK:1. So I need to pay with tokens: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2. I have exactly those tokens. No gold tokens. So purchase is valid. Therefore, I will purchase L2_48.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 10 strategic pivot: I'm at 0 points vs opponent's 1 point - I MUST start scoring urgently. My reserved L2_55 (2 points) requires GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 after my RED 1 bonus. I currently have GREEN 1, RED 1, so I need RED 2, BLACK 2 more. Critical insight: After purchasing L2_55 (which grants me WHITE 3 bonus total), L2_45 becomes incredibly cheap - just WHITE 2 cost due to WHITE 3 bonus (base cost WHITE 5 minus WHITE 3 = WHITE 2)! This creates a fast 4-point path that's much faster than accumulating BLACK 7 for L3_82. Multi-turn execution: Turn 10 (now): Take GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 → tokens GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1 (5 tokens, legal). Turn 11: Take RED 1, BLACK 1, WHITE 1 → GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 2, WHITE 1 (8 tokens). Turn 12: Purchase L2_55 (costs exactly GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 with bonuses) → 2 points, WHITE 3 bonus, remaining GREEN 1, WHITE 1 (2 tokens). Turn 13: Take WHITE 1 plus two others → accumulate WHITE 2 total. Turn 14: Purchase L2_45 (costs WHITE 2 with WHITE 3 bonus) → 4 points total, gain BLACK 1 bonus! Board verification: GREEN 3✓, RED 2✓, BLACK 4✓ all available. Taking exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors with 1 each (valid TAKE_TOKENS action). Token math: 2 current → 5 after (under 10 limit, no returns). Opponent has WHITE 2, RED 1 and cannot afford either L2_45 or L2_55 this turn, so my targets are safe. This balanced gathering (GREEN for flexibility, RED/BLACK for L2_55) executes my 4-point plan efficiently.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0 (total 3 tokens). I have 1 point from L2_48. Bonuses: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. I have 3 tokens total, so I can take up to 7 tokens without exceeding 10. I should aim to build towards another card to increase my score. Looking at the board, potential targets: L2_49 (cost WHITE:5, BLUE:3) gives 2 prestige and BLUE bonus. With my BLUE bonus of 1, effective cost WHITE:5, BLUE:2. I have WHITE:2 tokens, BLUE:0 tokens, need WHITE:3 more, BLUE:2 more. That's a bit far. L2_45 (cost WHITE:5) gives 2 prestige and BLACK bonus. Effective cost WHITE:5, I have WHITE:2, need 3 more. L2_46 (cost BLACK:6) gives 3 prestige and BLACK bonus. With BLACK bonus 1, effective cost BLACK:5, I have BLACK:0 tokens, need 5. L2_64 (cost GREEN:6) gives 3 prestige and GREEN bonus. With GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:5, I have GREEN:0, need 5. Level 1 cards: L1_24 (cost GREEN:4) gives 1 prestige and WHITE bonus. With GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:3, I have GREEN:0, need 3. L1_10 (cost WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1) gives BLUE bonus. With my bonuses: GREEN:1 reduces GREEN cost to 0, BLACK:1 reduces BLACK cost to 0, so effective cost WHITE:1, RED:2. I have WHITE:2, RED:1, need RED:1 more. That card gives 0 prestige but a BLUE bonus, which would bring my BLUE bonus to 2. That could help with L2_49. L1_28 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) gives GREEN bonus. Bonuses: BLUE:1 reduces BLUE to 2, GREEN:1 reduces GREEN to 0, effective cost WHITE:1, BLUE:2. I have WHITE:2, BLUE:0, need BLUE:2. L1_32 (cost BLACK:4) gives 1 prestige and GREEN bonus. With BLACK bonus 1, effective cost BLACK:3, I have BLACK:0, need 3. Nobles: N9 requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3. I have bonuses: GREEN:1, RED:0, BLUE:1, so I need cards giving additional bonuses. N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4. I have RED:0, BLACK:1. N2 requires GREEN:4, RED:4. I have GREEN:1, RED:0. So nobles are not close. I need to prioritize points. L2_49 gives 2 points, which is good. To get there, I need WHITE and BLUE tokens. I should start collecting WHITE and BLUE. Available tokens on board: WHITE:2, BLUE:4, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:3. I can take 3 different colors. Since I need WHITE and BLUE, I should take WHITE and BLUE plus a third color that helps another goal. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and RED would give me WHITE:3, BLUE:1, RED:2 after adding to current, which helps with L1_10 (needs WHITE:1, RED:2). That card gives BLUE bonus, advancing my engine. Alternatively, taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK would give WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, which helps with L1_32 (needs BLACK:3) but not immediately. L1_10 seems more immediately affordable after this token grab. After taking WHITE, BLUE, RED, I would have tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, RED:2, GREEN:0, BLACK:0. Total 6 tokens. Then I could purchase L1_10 next turn if I want, costing WHITE:1, RED:2 (effective after bonuses), spending WHITE:1, RED:2, leaving WHITE:2, BLUE:1, others 0, total 3 tokens. That gives me another BLUE bonus, making BLUE bonus total 2, which reduces L2_49's BLUE cost to 1 (since cost BLUE:3, bonus 2 => BLUE:1). Then I would need WHITE:5, which I would have WHITE:2, need 3 more. So that's a path. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN to start building towards L1_24 (needs GREEN:3) or L2_64. But L1_24 gives 1 point and WHITE bonus, which is also good. After taking WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, I'd have WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0. Then L1_24 effective cost GREEN:3, I'd have GREEN:1, need 2 more. That's also reasonable. But L1_10 is cheaper and gives a bonus I need for L2_49. I think going for L1_10 is efficient because it uses my existing RED token and WHITE tokens, and it's affordable soon. Also, note that taking RED is safe because there is 1 RED on board, so I can take 1 RED. But if I take RED, the board will have 0 RED left, which might hinder opponent if they need RED. That's good. So I'll take WHITE, BLUE, RED. Check legality: WHITE has 2 >=1, BLUE has 4 >=1, RED has 1 >=1. All good. I cannot take 2 of any color because none have 4+. So TAKE_TOKENS with take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1. No return needed.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 11—RED BOTTLENECK + LIMITED TOKEN OPTIONS: Board RED 0 blocks L2_55 purchase (needs GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 after bonuses; I'm short RED 1). Attempted pivot to taking BLACK 2 fails: Board has only BLACK 3, and rules require 4+ available to take 2-of-same! Invalid action. Valid token options: Only 3-different-colors with 1 each (WHITE/BLUE/GREEN/BLACK combinations). Taking tokens doesn't solve RED shortage—L2_55 remains inaccessible until board gets RED. Opponent has RED 2 and can afford L1_10 (costs WHITE 1, RED 2 with their bonuses), so they might purchase it next turn, returning RED 2 to board. However, I should secure L1_10 for myself because: (1) IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE: Costs WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 1; with my WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 1 bonuses becomes GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1. I have GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1✓. (2) ENGINE STRENGTH: Gains BLUE 2 bonus (total BLUE 3), significantly reducing future BLUE costs. (3) COMPETITIVE DENIAL: Prevents opponent from getting BLUE bonus, maintaining tempo advantage. (4) TOKEN RETURN: My spent tokens (GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1) return to board, making board RED=1 for next turn. Post-purchase: GREEN 1, RED 1 tokens (2 total), WHITE 2/BLUE 3/RED 1 bonuses. With BLUE 3, cards like L2_49 (2 points, costs WHITE 5, BLUE 3 → WHITE 5, BLUE 0) become accessible if I gather WHITE. Turn 12+: Either pursue L2_55 if RED accumulates, or pivot to WHITE-heavy cards using BLUE 3 discount. At 0 points vs opponent's 1, need both engine (done) and scoring (next). Purchasing L1_10 maximizes immediate utility given constraints.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 6 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0) and 1 prestige point. My goal is to efficiently reach 15 points. I analyzed two main options: purchasing L1_30 (0 points, GREEN bonus) or reserving L2_49 (2 points, BLUE bonus). Purchasing L1_30 uses my tokens efficiently but yields no immediate points and slows my point progression. Reserving L2_49 secures a valuable 2-point card and provides a gold token for flexibility. With the reserve, I can take WHITE and BLUE tokens next turn and use the gold to cover the missing WHITE, enabling me to purchase L2_49 in two turns for a total of 3 points. This path accelerates my scoring and denies my opponent (who has strong BLUE bonuses) access to L2_49. Given my token count (6), reserving adds one gold, keeping me at 7 tokens, well under the limit. Therefore, reserving L2_49 is the optimal move.

Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 12 critical decision: Purchase L1_30 to (1) gain GREEN 1 bonus, making my reserved L2_55 significantly cheaper—it becomes RED 3, BLACK 2 instead of GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 2 (saves GREEN 1!), (2) deny opponent GREEN 2 bonus—opponent has BLUE 1, RED 2 and can also afford L1_30 this turn; if they get GREEN 2 bonus (total GREEN 3), they'd easily afford high-value cards like L2_64 (3 points, costs GREEN 6 → GREEN 3), and (3) return RED 1 to board, improving token availability from RED 1 to RED 2 (critical since RED is the bottleneck color). Verification: L1_30 exists on board ✓, costs BLUE 2, RED 2 base → RED 1 with my WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1 bonuses ✓. I have GREEN 1, RED 1 tokens, so I pay RED 1 ✓. Post-purchase state: GREEN 1 token remaining, WHITE 2/BLUE 2/GREEN 1/RED 1 bonuses (6 total bonuses!), 0 points. Multi-turn plan to L2_55: Board after my purchase becomes RED 2, BLACK 4. Turn 13: Take BLACK 2 → GREEN 1, BLACK 2 (3 tokens). Turn 14-15: Gather RED 3 via taking RED 1 each turn with others. Turn 16: Purchase L2_55 (costs RED 3, BLACK 2 with G1 bonus) → score 2 points, gain WHITE 3 bonus. While this 4-turn path seems slow, buying L1_30 NOW is strategically critical: opponent is at 1 point vs my 0, and preventing them from accessing GREEN-heavy scoring cards (by denying GREEN 3 total) maintains tempo balance. The 6-bonus engine positions me for efficient Level 2/3 purchases later.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am close to affording my reserved card L2_49, which gives 2 prestige points. I currently have WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GOLD:1, and need 2 more WHITE and 1 more BLUE to afford it without gold, but with gold I can cover one missing token. By taking WHITE, BLUE, and RED tokens, I will have WHITE:4, BLUE:2, and GOLD:1, allowing me to purchase L2_49 next turn by spending WHITE:4, BLUE:2, and using gold for the remaining WHITE cost. This move efficiently progresses toward scoring points without wasting turns on low-value purchases. Taking RED also potentially denies the opponent, who may need RED for their strategies. My token count will be exactly 10, so no need to return any tokens.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: Turn 13—BLACK BONUS FOR TOKEN EFFICIENCY: L1_6 affordable (costs GREEN 1 with my bonuses) and critical for managing token scarcity + accelerating scoring. Analysis: (1) TOKEN BOTTLENECK: Board has RED 1, BLACK 4—highly constrained supply. Taking tokens without bonuses risks hitting 10-token-cap before gathering enough for L2_55 (needs RED 3, BLACK 2). Path simulation: Take BLACK 2 → GREEN 1, BLACK 2 (turn 13) → gather RED slowly due to RED 1 scarcity → hit 9-10 tokens by turn 15-16 → cannot take more tokens without purchasing/returning → delayed L2_55 by 6+ turns. (2) BLACK BONUS SOLUTION: Buying L1_6 gains BLACK 1 bonus, reducing L2_55 from RED 3, BLACK 2 to RED 3, BLACK 1 (saves 1 token slot). More importantly, opens alternative HIGH-VALUE path: L2_46 (3 points, BLACK 6 → BLACK 5 with B1 bonus). Post-purchase: Take BLACK 2 + BLACK 2 + BLACK 1 = BLACK 5 over 3 turns → purchase L2_46 for 3 points immediately, instead of waiting for scarce RED tokens! (3) BOARD TOKEN RETURN: Spending GREEN 1 returns it to board (GREEN 4 available), maintaining healthy supply. Opponent at 10 tokens MUST purchase next turn (likely L2_49), returning WHITE 4, BLUE 2—diversifying board. (4) BONUS ENGINE: 7 total bonuses (W2/B2/G1/R1/B1) maximize discount efficiency across ALL future purchases. Post-purchase state: 0 tokens, prime position to execute either L2_46 path (3 points fast) or L2_55 path (2 points + WHITE 3 bonus). Verification: L1_6 exists on board ✓, costs GREEN 1 with bonuses ✓, I have GREEN 1 ✓. Strategic pivot from RED-dependent L2_55 to BLACK-rich L2_46 path (board has BLACK 4, enabling faster accumulation than RED 1). This purchases 0-point card but unblocks 3-point L2_46 within 4 turns, vs 6+ turns for L2_55 under RED scarcity.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GOLD:1 tokens, and my reserved card L2_49 costs WHITE:5, BLUE:3. My BLUE bonus is 1, so effective cost is WHITE:5, BLUE:2. I have WHITE tokens 4, BLUE tokens 2, and 1 gold token. To cover the cost: I need WHITE:5, but I have only 4 WHITE tokens. I can use the gold token as a wildcard to cover the missing WHITE, so I can spend 4 WHITE, 2 BLUE, and 1 gold. That exactly meets the cost. After purchasing, I will spend 4 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 gold, leaving me with WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GOLD:0, plus my other tokens (GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:0). I will gain 2 prestige points, bringing my total to 3, and increase my BLUE bonus to 2 (since L2_49 gives a BLUE bonus). This is the optimal move because it scores points immediately and advances my engine. I should not take tokens because I am at 10 tokens currently (WHITE:4 + BLUE:2 + RED:3 + GOLD:1 = 10). Taking any tokens would exceed 10 and require returning tokens, which is inefficient. I could consider purchasing other cards, but L2_49 is the highest point card I can afford right now. Other affordable cards: L1_24 (cost GREEN:4) I have GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:3, but I have 0 GREEN tokens and 0 gold left after using gold for L2_49, so cannot afford. L1_28 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) with bonuses BLUE:1, GREEN:1, effective cost WHITE:1, BLUE:2, but I would have to spend BLUE:2 and WHITE:1, which I have, but it gives 0 points and a GREEN bonus, which is less valuable than the 2 points from L2_49. L1_32 (cost BLACK:4) effective BLACK:3 with my BLACK bonus 1, but I have 0 BLACK tokens. L1_21 (cost RED:2, BLACK:1) effective RED:2, BLACK:0 with bonuses, I have RED:3, so I could afford it, but it gives 0 points and a WHITE bonus, which is not as good as scoring 2 points. Therefore, purchasing L2_49 is the best move.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 14—L2_60 GATEWAY TO 4 POINTS (FASTEST SCORING): At 0 points vs opponent's 3, I need to score URGENTLY. Analysis reveals L2_60 (1 point, GREEN bonus, costs WHITE:2/BLUE:3/BLACK:2) as THE optimal target. Affordability check: Base cost becomes BLUE:1, BLACK:1 after my WHITE:2/BLUE:2/BLACK:1 bonuses (WHITE:2-2=0✓, BLUE:3-2=1✓, BLACK:2-1=1✓). Taking BLUE:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1 (3 different colors from board supply: BLUE:4✓, BLACK:4✓, GREEN:4✓) enables immediate L2_60 purchase next turn. Strategic superiority: (1) FAST FIRST POINT: Turn 15 purchase → 1 point scored, narrowing gap to 1-3 quickly (critical tempo when behind). (2) GREEN:2 MULTIPLIER: L2_60 grants GREEN bonus, making my total GREEN:2. This reduces L2_64 (3 points, costs GREEN:6) to just GREEN:4! (3) 4-POINT EXECUTION: Post-L2_60: GREEN:1 token remains → Turn 16: Take GREEN:2 (board GREEN:3 after my turn) → GREEN:3 total → Turn 17: Take GREEN:1 + 2 others → GREEN:4 → Turn 18: Purchase L2_64 → 4 POINTS TOTAL in 5 turns (T14-T18)! Alternative path comparison: L2_46 (BLACK:5 needed): 4 turns → 3 points, but doesn't score until T17 (delayed tempo). L2_45 (WHITE:3 needed): 3 turns → 2 points, no multiplier unlock. L2_60→L2_64: 5 turns → 4 points, scores 1pt by T15 (superior tempo + higher total). Why include GREEN:1 when I only need BLUE/BLACK for L2_60? Answer: GREEN token feeds directly into L2_64 accumulation plan—efficient multi-turn resource positioning! Post-turn state: 3 tokens (BLUE:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1), perfectly staged for T15 L2_60 purchase. Opponent threat: Opponent has RED:3 and might buy L1_21 (0 points), but that doesn't advance their 3-point lead, giving me free tempo to execute 4-point path.

======================================================================================

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1, and I just purchased L2_49. My current tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:0, GOLD:0. Total 3 tokens. Score: 3. Bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1.

I need to plan my next move to continue scoring points efficiently. My token count is low (3), so I can take up to 7 more tokens without hitting the limit. I should aim for another high-value card.

Looking at the board:
- L2_46 (cost BLACK:6, 3 points, BLACK bonus). With my BLACK bonus 1, effective cost BLACK:5. I have BLACK:0 tokens, need 5. That's a lot, but 3 points is good.
- L2_64 (cost GREEN:6, 3 points, GREEN bonus). With GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:5. I have GREEN:0 tokens, need 5.
- L2_45 (cost WHITE:5, 2 points, BLACK bonus). With no WHITE bonus, effective cost WHITE:5. I have WHITE:0 tokens, need 5.
- L2_60 (cost WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2, 1 point, GREEN bonus). With bonuses BLUE:2, BLACK:1, effective cost WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. I have WHITE:0, BLUE:0, BLACK:0, need those tokens.
- Level 1 cards: L1_24 (cost GREEN:4, 1 point, WHITE bonus). With GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:3. I have GREEN:0, need 3.
- L1_28 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, 0 points, GREEN bonus). With bonuses BLUE:2, GREEN:1, effective cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1. I have WHITE:0, BLUE:0, need those.
- L1_32 (cost BLACK:4, 1 point, GREEN bonus). With BLACK bonus 1, effective cost BLACK:3. I have BLACK:0, need 3.
- L1_21 (cost RED:2, BLACK:1, 0 points, WHITE bonus). With bonuses RED:0, BLACK:1, effective cost RED:2, BLACK:0. I have RED:3, so I could afford it now! But it gives 0 points and a WHITE bonus. Purchasing it would spend RED:2, leaving me with RED:1, and give me a WHITE bonus (bringing WHITE to 1). That's not terrible, but 0 points doesn't help my score. However, it could help with nobles or future cards. But I should prioritize points.

Nobles: N9 (GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). My bonuses: GREEN:1, RED:0, BLUE:2. I need additional bonuses: GREEN 2 more, RED 3 more, BLUE 1 more. Not close.
N5 (RED:4, BLACK:4). Bonuses: RED:0, BLACK:1. Need RED 4, BLACK 3.
N2 (GREEN:4, RED:4). Need GREEN 3, RED 4.

So nobles are not immediate.

Given my low token count, I should take tokens to build towards a high-point card. L2_46 (3 points) or L2_64 (3 points) are attractive. L2_46 requires BLACK tokens, L2_64 requires GREEN tokens. Looking at the board token supply: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:3. I can take three different colors.

I could start collecting BLACK tokens for L2_46. Taking BLACK, plus two other colors that might help with other cards. For example, taking BLACK, BLUE, and WHITE. That would give me BLACK:1, BLUE:1, WHITE:1, adding to my RED:3, total 6 tokens. Then I'd need more BLACK tokens (4 more) to afford L2_46. That's a long way.

Alternatively, L2_64 requires GREEN tokens. Taking GREEN, plus BLUE and WHITE. That would give me GREEN:1, BLUE:1, WHITE:1, total 6 tokens. Need 4 more GREEN.

L2_45 requires WHITE tokens. Taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK would give WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, need 4 more WHITE.

L1_24 (1 point) requires GREEN tokens. Taking GREEN, WHITE, BLUE would give GREEN:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, need 2 more GREEN to afford L1_24, which gives 1 point and a WHITE bonus. That's a relatively quick target.

L1_32 (1 point) requires BLACK tokens. Taking BLACK, WHITE, BLUE would give BLACK:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, need 2 more BLACK to afford L1_32.

Both L1_24 and L1_32 give 1 point and a bonus. L1_24 gives WHITE bonus, which I have 0 of currently. L1_32 gives GREEN bonus, which I already have 1 of. Getting a WHITE bonus could help with nobles or cards like L2_45 or L3_82.

But maybe I should aim for a higher-point card. L2_60 gives 1 point and a GREEN bonus. Effective cost WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. I could take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK now, giving me WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. Then I'd need one more WHITE to afford it (since I have RED:3, but RED not needed). That's close.

Actually, after taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, I'd have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:3. To afford L2_60, I need WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. So I'd be short one WHITE. I could use a gold if I had one, but I don't. So I'd need another turn to get another WHITE.

Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN to start building towards L1_28 (0 points) or L1_24. But L1_28 gives GREEN bonus, which I already have, and 0 points.

Given my current position, I think the best move is to take tokens that set me up for a quick purchase next turn, preferably one that gives points. L1_21 is affordable now (0 points), but spending tokens on a 0-point card might be okay if it gives a useful bonus. However, I have RED:3, and L1_21 costs RED:2, BLACK:1. With my BLACK bonus 1, the BLACK cost is reduced to 0, so I only need RED:2. I have RED:3, so I could purchase it now without taking any tokens. That would give me a WHITE bonus, bringing my WHITE bonus to 1, and spend RED:2, leaving me with RED:1. That would be a quick engine building move, but no points.

But I should consider that purchasing L1_21 would leave me with only 1 token (RED:1), and I'd have 3 tokens total (since I spend 2). That's even lower, and I could then take 3 tokens next turn. That might be a valid strategy: buy the 0-point card now to increase bonuses, then take tokens towards a bigger card.

Let's evaluate: If I purchase L1_21 now, I spend RED:2, have RED:1 left, tokens total 1. Score remains 3. Bonuses become WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, RED:0. Then next turn I can take 3 tokens, e.g., WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, giving me WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, plus RED:1, total 4 tokens. Then I could aim for L2_60 (cost WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 after bonuses) which I'd be short one WHITE. Or L1_24 (need GREEN:3) etc.

Alternatively, if I take tokens now, I could take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, giving me WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:3, total 6 tokens. Then next turn I could purchase L1_21 (cost RED:2, BLACK:0 after bonuses) using RED:2, leaving me with WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:1, total 4 tokens, and I'd get a WHITE bonus. That delays the purchase by one turn but gives me more tokens in hand.

I think taking tokens first is better because it keeps my options open. Also, note that the board has RED:1 only, so if I take RED now, I would take the last RED token, which could deny the opponent. But I already have RED:3, and RED is not crucial for me. Taking RED might be good for denial.

Given that, I could take WHITE, BLUE, RED. That would give me WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:4 (since I have 3, add 1), total tokens 5 (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:4). That's a lot of RED, but RED is not very useful for my current targets. However, it could be used for purchasing L1_21 (needs RED:2) or for future cards. But I'd rather take colors I need more, like BLACK or GREEN.

Considering the board token counts: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:3. I can take any three colors with at least 1 token each. I think the best is to take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK because those are colors needed for L2_60 and other cards. That gives me WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:3, total 6 tokens.

Then next turn I can purchase L1_21 if I want (cost RED:2, BLACK:0), spending RED:2, leaving me with WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:1, and gaining a WHITE bonus. That's fine.

But maybe I should consider L2_60 more seriously. With my bonuses, L2_60 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. After taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, so I need one more WHITE. I could get that by taking two WHITE tokens if available, but next turn I might be able to take 2 WHITE if there are at least 4 WHITE on board. Currently WHITE:4, so if I take 1 WHITE now, there will be 3 left. If opponent takes none, next turn WHITE will be 3, not enough to take 2 (need 4+). So I can't take 2 WHITE next turn. I could take WHITE and another color, but then I'd still be short one WHITE. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token, but that doesn't give points.

Maybe I should aim for L1_24 (1 point, WHITE bonus). That requires GREEN:3 after bonus. I have GREEN:0. If I take GREEN, WHITE, BLUE now, I'll have GREEN:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:3. Then I need two more GREEN. I could take 2 GREEN next turn if GREEN has at least 4. Currently GREEN:3, after I take 1, becomes 2, so not enough for 2. So that path is slow.

Given the complexities, I think the safest move is to take tokens that are generally useful: WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. That builds towards multiple cards.

I'll take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. Check legality: WHITE:4 >=1, BLUE:3 >=1, BLACK:3 >=1. All good. No need to return tokens.

Therefore, action_type: TAKE_TOKENS, take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_BLACK=1. Others 0.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 15—EXECUTE L2_60 PURCHASE (CRITICAL FIRST POINT): Perfect execution of Turn 14 plan! I have exactly BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1 tokens (3 total). L2_60 verification: Board position confirmed✓, costs WHITE 2/BLUE 3/BLACK 2 base → BLUE 1/BLACK 1 after my WHITE 2/BLUE 2/BLACK 1 bonuses✓, I possess required BLUE 1✓ and BLACK 1✓. Purchase impact: (1) SCORE FIRST POINT: 0→1 points, narrowing gap from 0-3 to 1-3 (critical tempo when opponent leads). (2) GREEN 2 MULTIPLIER: Gain GREEN bonus → total GREEN 2, reducing L2_64 from GREEN 6 to GREEN 4 needed! (3) FAST 4-POINT PATH: Post-purchase GREEN 1 token remains, positioning for L2_64 execution. Turn 16: Take GREEN 2 (board GREEN 3+ available) → GREEN 3 tokens. Turn 17: Take GREEN 1 + 2 others → GREEN 4 tokens. Turn 18: Purchase L2_64 (costs GREEN 4 with GREEN 2 bonus) → 4 POINTS TOTAL in just 4 turns! Alternative paths rejected: L2_55 requires RED 3 (board only RED 1, would take 6+ turns to execute). L1_28 also affordable (costs BLUE 1 only with bonuses) but gives 0 points vs L2_60's 1 point—strictly inferior when behind. Board threat: Opponent at 3 points might purchase L1_21 (0 points) next turn but that doesn't advance their score, maintaining safe tempo window. Token efficiency: Spending BLUE 1, BLACK 1 leaves GREEN 1 (1 token post-purchase), perfect staging for GREEN accumulation phase. This purchase executes the strategic plan flawlessly!

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:1, total 6. Score 3. Bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. I need to accumulate tokens to afford a high-point card. My current token count is 6, so I can take up to 4 more tokens without exceeding 10. I should take tokens that advance my immediate goals. I can afford L1_21 now (cost RED:2, BLACK:1; after bonuses, effective cost RED:2, BLACK:0) using RED:2, but it gives 0 points and a WHITE bonus. While this boosts my engine, scoring points is more urgent. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but that delays points. Taking tokens to build towards L2_60 (1 point, GREEN bonus) is promising: after bonuses, cost is WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. I currently have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:3, so I need 1 more WHITE to afford L2_60. However, the board has WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:3. If I take WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK again, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:2, RED:3, total 9 tokens. Then I could afford L2_60 next turn by spending WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, leaving me with WHITE:0, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:3, total 5 tokens and scoring 1 point. That's a solid plan. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK to build towards L1_24 (1 point, WHITE bonus) or L1_32 (1 point, GREEN bonus). But L1_24 requires GREEN:3 after bonus, and I'd have GREEN:1 after taking, needing 2 more GREEN; that's slower. L1_32 requires BLACK:3 after bonus, and I'd have BLACK:2 after taking, needing 1 more BLACK; that's also possible but only 1 point. L2_60 gives 1 point as well but also a GREEN bonus, which I already have, so it's similar. However, L2_60 is a level 2 card, which might be better for denying opponent. Also, note that opponent has strong WHITE and GREEN bonuses and may be aiming for L2_64 or L2_44. I should consider denying colors. The board has RED:1, which is low; taking RED would deny opponent, but I already have 3 RED, and RED isn't crucial for my plans. Taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK is efficient because it gets me closer to L2_60 and also builds towards L2_46 (3 points) in the long term. After taking, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:2, RED:3, total 9 tokens. Next turn, I can purchase L2_60 if I want, or perhaps reserve a high-point card if a good one appears. But purchasing L2_60 gives a point and a bonus, which is decent. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN to start building towards L1_24 or L2_64, but that delays L2_60. Given my current bonuses, L2_60 is very close. So I'll take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. Check legality: WHITE:3 >=1, BLUE:3 >=1, BLACK:3 >=1. Yes. No need to return tokens.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 16—L2_64 PATH EXECUTION (3-TOKEN GATHERING): Following Turn 15's plan to purchase L2_64 (3 points, costs GREEN 4 with my GREEN 2 bonus). Current state: GREEN 1 token, need GREEN 3 more. Board has GREEN 3 (cannot take 2-of-same; need 4+ available per rules). Taking GREEN 1 + 2 others is only valid option. Strategic token selection: (1) GREEN 1 (mandatory progress towards L2_64), (2) BLUE 1 (positions for L3_85: 4 points, costs WHITE 1, BLUE 4 after bonuses post-L2_64), (3) WHITE 1 (also for L3_85). Board verification: WHITE 2✓, BLUE 2✓, GREEN 3✓. Post-turn: GREEN 2, BLUE 1, WHITE 1 (4 tokens total, well under 10 cap). Multi-turn execution: T17: Take GREEN 1 + others → GREEN 3. T18: Take GREEN 1 + others → GREEN 4. T19: Purchase L2_64 → 4 points total (taking lead over opponent's 3). Why not reserve L3_85 now? Answer: Both paths (reserve vs take-tokens) reach L2_64 by T19 (same timeline), and L3_85 unlikely to be taken by opponent (they need BLUE 4 after bonuses; have only BLUE 2 tokens). Keeping token-gathering flexibility. Opponent threat: At 9 tokens, opponent must purchase soon (likely L1_28 gaining GREEN bonus), but that doesn't block L2_64 race. First to 4 points wins tempo; executing fastest path.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:0, total 9 tokens. Score: 3. Bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1.

I can now afford L2_60, which costs WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2. My bonuses reduce BLUE by 2 and BLACK by 1, so effective cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. I have exactly WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:2, so I can spend WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, leaving me with WHITE:0, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, RED:3, total 5 tokens. This purchase gives me 1 prestige point (bringing my total to 4) and a GREEN bonus (bringing my GREEN bonus to 2).

Other options:
- Purchase L1_21: cost RED:2, BLACK:1, effective RED:2 (since BLACK bonus 1). I have RED:3, so I could afford it, but it gives 0 points and a WHITE bonus. While a WHITE bonus could be useful for future cards like L3_82, scoring points is more urgent. Purchasing L1_21 would spend RED:2, leaving me with RED:1, and not increase my score. That's inefficient at this stage.
- Take tokens: I have 9 tokens, so I could take 3 tokens (or 2 of the same color if available). However, taking tokens would put me at 12 tokens, exceeding the 10 limit, so I would need to return 2 tokens. This is inefficient because I can instead purchase a card and reduce my token count while scoring points. Taking tokens would delay scoring and potentially waste a turn.
- Reserve a card: I could reserve a high-point card like L3_82 or L2_46, but that would not give me points immediately and would only add a gold token. My token count is 9, so reserving would bring me to 10 tokens, limiting future token-taking. It's better to purchase now.

L2_60 is a level 2 card with 1 point and a GREEN bonus. It also denies the opponent (who has GREEN bonuses) from potentially taking it. Purchasing it now is efficient and aligns with my plan from previous turns. I should also note that my opponent has a reserved card L2_55 (2 points, WHITE bonus) and may be close to purchasing it, so I need to keep scoring points to stay ahead.

Thus, purchasing L2_60 is the optimal move.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_60]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card L2_60 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, total 9 tokens, score 3, bonuses BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. I reviewed the board and my options. I cannot purchase L2_60 because it is not on the board (I see L2_46, L2_64, L2_45, L2_44). My previous reasoning mistakenly referred to L2_60, but it appears that card is not available; perhaps it was purchased by opponent or replaced. I need to choose a valid action. I could take tokens, but I have 9 tokens already, so taking 3 would bring me to 12, requiring me to return 2 tokens. That is inefficient. I could purchase a card. Affordable cards with my current tokens and bonuses:
- L1_21 (cost RED:2, BLACK:1). With my BLACK bonus 1, effective cost RED:2, BLACK:0. I have RED:3, so I can afford it. It gives 0 points and a WHITE bonus, increasing my WHITE bonus to 1. This is not great for points but improves my engine and gets me closer to nobles (N9 requires WHITE? actually N9 requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3; I have GREEN:1, RED:0, BLUE:2, so WHITE not directly helpful). However, it spends tokens and reduces my token count, allowing me to take tokens more freely next turn.
- L1_24 (cost GREEN:4). With GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:3. I have GREEN:0 tokens, cannot afford.
- L1_28 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1). With bonuses BLUE:2, GREEN:1, effective cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1. I have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, so I can afford it. It gives 0 points and a GREEN bonus (which I already have). Spending WHITE:1, BLUE:1 would leave me with WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:3, BLACK:2, total 7 tokens. That's also an option, but again 0 points.
- L1_32 (cost BLACK:4). With BLACK bonus 1, effective cost BLACK:3. I have BLACK:2, cannot afford.
- L2_46 (cost BLACK:6). With BLACK bonus 1, effective cost BLACK:5. I have BLACK:2, cannot afford.
- L2_64 (cost GREEN:6). With GREEN bonus 1, effective cost GREEN:5. I have GREEN:0, cannot afford.
- L2_45 (cost WHITE:5). No WHITE bonus, effective cost WHITE:5. I have WHITE:2, cannot afford.
- L2_44 (cost GREEN:5, RED:3). With bonuses GREEN:1, RED:0, effective cost GREEN:4, RED:3. I have GREEN:0, RED:3, cannot afford.
- Level 3 cards are too expensive.
Thus, the only cards I can afford are L1_21 and L1_28, both 0 points. Between them, L1_21 gives a WHITE bonus (which I lack) and uses RED tokens (which I have excess of). L1_28 uses WHITE and BLUE, which are also useful for future cards. However, L1_21 is cheaper in terms of token diversity; it only spends RED, leaving my WHITE and BLUE intact for future purchases like L2_45 or L3_82. Moreover, purchasing L1_21 reduces my token count to 7 (spend RED:2, left with WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2), allowing me to take 3 tokens next turn without returning any. That is a good position.
Alternatively, I could reserve a card. Reserving L2_64 (3 points) might be good, but it would give me a gold token and put me at 10 tokens, then I would need to return tokens if I take more. I think purchasing a card now is better because it advances my engine. Since I cannot score points immediately, improving my bonuses is acceptable. I'll purchase L1_21.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 17 STRATEGIC PIVOT: Purchase L1_28 to unlock GREEN:3 bonus for accelerated L2_64→L3_85 path! Analysis: (1) Original T16 plan BLOCKED—board has only GREEN:2, cannot take 2-of-same (need 4+ per rules), making token-gathering path to L2_64 require 3+ turns (T17-T20+). (2) L1_24 alternative (1pt, costs GREEN:2) gives immediate point BUT leads to slower path—WHITE:3 bonus targets (L3_82/L3_80) need BLACK:7, extremely hard to gather. (3) L1_28 SUPERIOR: 0pts but GREEN:3 bonus transforms game! Affordability verified: L1_28 exists on board✓, costs WHITE:1/BLUE:3/GREEN:1 base → BLUE:1 only after my WHITE:2/BLUE:2/GREEN:2 bonuses✓, I have BLUE:1✓. CRITICAL IMPACT: GREEN:3 bonus reduces L2_64 from GREEN:4 to GREEN:3 needed! I have GREEN:2 tokens, only need GREEN:1 more (vs GREEN:2 more with GREEN:2 bonus). Execution: T17 (now): Buy L1_28 → GREEN:3 bonus unlocked, GREEN:2 tokens remain. T18: Take GREEN:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 (board supplies verified: GREEN:2✓, RED:3✓, BLACK:2✓) → GREEN:3 total. T19: Purchase L2_64 (costs GREEN:3 with bonus) → 4 POINTS TOTAL, TAKING LEAD vs opponent's 3! Long-term dominance: L2_64 grants GREEN bonus → total GREEN:4 → L3_85 (4pts, costs WHITE:3/BLUE:6/GREEN:3) becomes WHITE:1/BLUE:4 only (GREEN:0 after bonus!) → 8 points by T23! This 0-point sacrifice enables FASTEST path to 15: GREEN-heavy cards (L2_64+L3_85=7pts in 6 turns) vs alternatives needing 10+ turns. Opponent denial: Opponent can also afford L1_28 (has BLUE:2, needs BLUE:1); buying first blocks their GREEN:2 path!

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:0, total 7 tokens. Score 3. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. I need to progress towards scoring more points. My token count is 7, so I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10 (will be 10 exactly). Taking tokens is efficient because I have no immediate high-point purchase available. I should aim to collect tokens for a future high-value card. Looking at the board, L2_46 (3 points, BLACK bonus) requires BLACK:6, with my BLACK bonus 1 effective cost BLACK:5. I have BLACK:2, need 3 more. L2_64 (3 points, GREEN bonus) requires GREEN:6, effective GREEN:5, I have GREEN:0. L2_45 (2 points, BLACK bonus) requires WHITE:5, effective WHITE:5, I have WHITE:2. L2_44 (2 points, BLACK bonus) requires GREEN:5, RED:3, effective GREEN:4, RED:3, I have GREEN:0, RED:1. L3 cards are too expensive now. Among these, L2_46 is attractive (3 points). I can take BLACK, WHITE, and BLUE to build towards it and other cards. Board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:2. I can take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. That gives me WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, bringing totals to WHITE:3, BLUE:3, BLACK:3, RED:1, total 10 tokens. This sets me up to possibly afford L2_45 (needs WHITE:5) or L2_46 (needs BLACK:5) in future turns after acquiring more tokens. Alternatively, I could reserve L2_64 (3 points) to secure it and get a gold, but that would put me at 8 tokens (since I get a gold) and I'd have to return tokens if I take more later. However, reserving might be good to deny opponent. But my current strategy is to gather tokens for a purchase. I think taking tokens is better because I can then purchase something soon. Also, note that opponent has strong GREEN bonuses and may be eyeing L2_64; taking GREEN tokens could deny them. But I need to consider my own goals. I'll take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK to maximize my flexibility. This brings me to exactly 10 tokens, no need to return any.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 18 CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION—Purchase L1_29 for FREE to unlock GREEN 4 bonus and enable immediate L2_64 next turn! Discovery: L1_29 (0 points, GREEN bonus) costs WHITE 2 + BLUE 1 base, which is COMPLETELY COVERED by my WHITE 2 + BLUE 2 bonuses (0 tokens needed after discount)! This is a free bonus upgrade. Strategic superiority: (1) IMMEDIATE L2_64 ACCESS: GREEN 4 bonus transforms L2_64 cost from GREEN 3 needed (per original T17 plan requiring token gathering) to GREEN 2 needed—EXACTLY what I currently have! Execution: T18 (now) buy L1_29 → GREEN 4 bonus unlocked. T19: Purchase L2_64 (costs GREEN 2 with G4 bonus, I have G2) → 4 POINTS TOTAL! Same timeline as original plan but WITHOUT token-gathering risk. (2) ACCELERATED L3_85 PATH: Post-L2_64, I gain GREEN 5 total bonus, reducing L3_85 from WHITE 3/BLUE 6/GREEN 3 to WHITE 1/BLUE 4 only (5 tokens total, vs 6 tokens with GREEN 4). This shaves 1 turn off execution → 8 points by T22 instead of T23! (3) RISK ELIMINATION: Original plan (take GREEN 1 + RED 1 + BLACK 1) exposed me to board token volatility. Board has only GREEN 2 currently—opponent likely purchases L1_32 next (spending BLACK 3, they're at 10 tokens), then might take GREEN tokens, potentially blocking my L2_64 path. Free L1_29 purchase bypasses all token-gathering, guaranteeing L2_64 access T19! (4) TOKEN FLEXIBILITY: Keeping 3 tokens (WHITE 1, GREEN 2) post-purchase preserves capacity to gather BLUE tokens for L3_85 immediately after L2_64, vs spending tokens now. Opponent analysis: They're at 3 points, 10 tokens—MUST purchase. L1_32 affordable (BLACK 3 needed, they have B3) → 4 points. By T19, I match at 4 points via L2_64, then race to L3_85 (4pts more) vs their constrained paths (L2_46 needs BLACK 5, L2_45 needs WHITE 4—both 3+ turns due to token scarcity). Verification: L1_29 on board ✓, costs WHITE 2/BLUE 1 → 0 after W2/B2 bonuses ✓, grants GREEN → total G4 ✓. FREE BONUS ENGINE UPGRADE!

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, total 10 tokens. Score: 3. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. I need to spend tokens to avoid being at the limit and to score points. I can afford L1_38 (cost WHITE:2, RED:2) with my bonuses: WHITE bonus 1 reduces WHITE cost to 1, RED bonus 0 so RED cost 2. I have WHITE:3, RED:1. I need WHITE:1, RED:2. I have WHITE:3, but only RED:1. However, I can use my other tokens or gold to substitute? I have no gold. But I can use other tokens? No, in Splendor you can only use tokens you have, and gold can substitute any color. Since I lack one RED token, I cannot afford L1_38 unless I use a gold token, which I don't have. Wait, check if I have any gold: GOLD:0. So I cannot afford L1_38. Let's check other affordable cards: L1_21 I already purchased. L1_28 (cost WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) with bonuses BLUE:2, GREEN:1, effective cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1. I have WHITE:3, BLUE:3, so I can afford it. It gives 0 points and a GREEN bonus. That's not ideal but it spends tokens and gives a bonus. L1_4 (cost GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1) with bonuses GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, effective cost GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:0. I have RED:1, cannot afford. L1_24 (cost GREEN:4) effective GREEN:3, I have GREEN:0. L1_32 (cost BLACK:4) effective BLACK:3, I have BLACK:3, so I can afford L1_32! It gives 1 point and a GREEN bonus. That's a good purchase: spend BLACK:3, use my BLACK bonus 1 to reduce cost by 1, so I need to pay BLACK:3. I have exactly BLACK:3. After purchasing, I will have WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0, total tokens 7, score 4, and increase GREEN bonus to 2. That's a solid move. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but I'm at 10 tokens, reserving would give me a gold and put me at 11, requiring me to return a token immediately. That's messy. Purchasing is better. So I'll purchase L1_32. It's on the board, I can afford it, and it gives a point.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_38]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_38
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, RED:1, BLACK:3, GREEN:0, GOLD:0), which is the maximum. Taking tokens would require returning tokens, making it inefficient. I should purchase a card if possible. Checking all face-up cards:
- L1_24: Effective cost GREEN:3, I have 0 GREEN tokens, cannot afford.
- L1_32: Cost BLACK:4, with my BLACK bonus of 1, effective cost BLACK:3. I have exactly 3 BLACK tokens, so I can afford it. It gives 1 prestige point and a GREEN bonus.
- L1_38: Effective cost WHITE:1, RED:2; I have WHITE:3 but only RED:1, cannot afford.
- L1_4: Effective cost RED:3; I have RED:1, cannot afford.
- All Level 2 and 3 cards are too expensive due to insufficient tokens or bonuses.
Purchasing L1_32 scores 1 point, bringing my total to 4, and increases my GREEN bonus to 2, aiding future purchases. Reserving a card would give a gold token but exceed the token limit, forcing a return and delaying points. Thus, purchasing L1_32 is the optimal move.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=6, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 19: EXECUTE L2_64 PURCHASE - CRITICAL PATH TO VICTORY! Current state analysis: I have GREEN:2 tokens with GREEN:4 bonus (thanks to "free" L1_29 purchase last turn). L2_64 (3 points, costs GREEN:6 base) now requires only GREEN:2 after my GREEN:4 bonus discount - EXACTLY what I possess! Verification: L2_64 exists on board ✓, costs GREEN:6 base → GREEN:2 after bonus ✓, I have GREEN:2 tokens ✓. PURCHASE IMPACT: (1) SCORE 3 POINTS: 1→4 points total, matching opponent's 4 points (eliminating their lead)! (2) UNLOCK FREE L1_24: Purchasing L2_64 grants GREEN bonus → total GREEN:5. This makes L1_24 (1 point, WHITE bonus, costs GREEN:4) completely FREE next turn (GREEN:4 - GREEN:5 = 0 cost!)! (3) ACCELERATED PATH TO 9 POINTS: T19 (now): L2_64 → 4 points, GREEN:5 bonus. T20: L1_24 (FREE) → 5 points, WHITE:3 bonus. T21-22: Gather BLUE:4 tokens (board has BLUE:1, will refill). T23: Purchase L3_85 (costs WHITE:3/BLUE:6/GREEN:3 base → BLUE:4 only after WHITE:3/BLUE:2/GREEN:5 bonuses) → 9 POINTS TOTAL! (4) WHITE:3 MULTIPLIER: L1_24's WHITE bonus transforms late-game options. L2_45 (2pt) becomes WHITE:2 cost, L3_82 (5pt) becomes BLACK:7 only. Multiple paths to 15 unlock. Strategic superiority: Opponent at 4 points has 7 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:1). Their best immediate move is L1_37 (0pt, FREE with bonuses), which doesn't advance their score. Their 3-point cards (L2_46, L2_64) require resource gathering I'm executing faster. By T20 I'll lead 5-4, and my accelerated L3_85 path (3 turns vs their 5+ turns to equivalent points) ensures victory. This purchase executes the strategic optimization from T18 perfectly - the "free" L1_29 investment now pays off with immediate access to 3 points + unlocking cascading free/cheap high-value cards!

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 7 tokens and need 1 BLUE and 1 GREEN to afford L3_85 (4 points). The board has BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:3, BLACK:4, WHITE:0. Taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED gives me the needed BLUE and GREEN, plus an extra RED for future. This brings me to 10 tokens, setting up L3_85 purchase next turn. Purchasing L1_37 now is free but gives no points and delays securing the scarce BLUE token. Opponent could take the last BLUE, so I should take it now.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 20 EXECUTE FREE L1_24: Following Turn 19's strategic plan perfectly! L1_24 verification: (1) Card exists on board✓, (2) costs GREEN:4 base → 0 after my GREEN:5 bonus✓, (3) completely FREE purchase✓. CRITICAL IMPACTS: (1) SCORE LEADERSHIP: 4→5 points, taking 5-4 LEAD over opponent! First to 5 points establishes tempo advantage. (2) WHITE:3 UNLOCK: Gain WHITE bonus → total WHITE:3, transforming multiple high-value targets! L3_85 (4pt) cost reduces from WHITE:1/BLUE:4 to just BLUE:4 only (GREEN:3 covered by G:5, WHITE:3 covered by W:3 new bonus)! L2_45 (2pt) becomes WHITE:5 - WHITE:3 = WHITE:2 only. L3_82 (5pt) becomes BLACK:6 only. (3) OPTIMAL SEQUENCING: Board has BLUE:0, so cannot gather BLUE tokens this turn anyway. Free purchase advances score while waiting for token refills. (4) OPPONENT CONSTRAINT: Opponent at 10 tokens MUST purchase or discard. Their free option L1_37 (0pt, RED bonus) doesn't advance score. Board threat: If opponent takes L1_24 first, I lose the free point! But they're unlikely to—they have abundant tokens, prefer higher-value purchases. VERIFICATION FINAL: L1_24 on board✓, costs 0 after GREEN:5 bonus✓, gains WHITE bonus✓, scores 1 point✓. Next turn plan: Gather tokens (preferably BLUE for L3_85 if available, or BLACK for L2_46/L3_82 paths). Multi-path flexibility: WHITE:3 bonus opens L2_45 (2pt), L3_82 (5pt), L3_80 (4pt) as alternatives to L3_85 if BLUE remains scarce. This FREE point positions me for mid-game dominance!

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=6, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:3, BLUE:4, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:0, total 10 tokens. Score 4. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:1. In my previous reasoning, I took BLUE, GREEN, RED to set up purchasing L3_85 (4 points, GREEN bonus). I now have the required tokens to purchase L3_85. Checking cost: L3_85 costs WHITE:3, BLUE:6, GREEN:3. With my bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, so effective cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:4, GREEN:1. I have tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:4, GREEN:1, exactly covering the cost. Purchasing this card will spend WHITE:2, BLUE:4, GREEN:1, leaving me with WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0, total 3 tokens, and increase my score to 8. This is a significant leap. I could also consider purchasing L2_57 (2 points, WHITE bonus) which costs RED:5, effective RED:5 (no RED bonus). I have RED:2, cannot afford. L2_46 (3 points) requires BLACK:6, effective BLACK:5, I have BLACK:0, cannot afford. L2_45 (2 points) requires WHITE:5, effective WHITE:4, I have WHITE:3, cannot afford. L2_44 (2 points) requires GREEN:5, RED:3, effective GREEN:3, RED:3, I have GREEN:1, RED:2, cannot afford. The only affordable card that gives points is L3_85. I should purchase it immediately to score 4 points and get closer to 15. This also gives me a GREEN bonus, increasing my GREEN bonus to 3, which helps with future purchases and nobles (N9 requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). After purchase, my bonuses will be WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1. That puts me closer to N9 (I have GREEN:3, RED:? I have RED:1, need RED:3; BLUE:2, need BLUE:1). Another noble, N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4, not close. N2 requires GREEN:4, RED:4, I have GREEN:3, RED:1. So nobles are still a bit away. But scoring 4 points is a priority. I must verify L3_85 is still on the board: yes, it is in faceUpCards LEVEL_3. So I will purchase L3_85.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 21 TACTICAL SHIFT—Opponent stole L3_85 (my planned card), now at 8 points vs my 5! CRITICAL ANALYSIS: (1) Opponent has 8 points, threatening to reach 15 before me. (2) I have only WHITE:1 token (1 total), bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:5, RED:1, BLACK:1. (3) Board has BLACK:4—can take BLACK:2 per rules (4+ available). OPTIMAL PATH DISCOVERED: BLACK-dominant card chain reaches 15 by T28! TARGET SEQUENCE: L3_82 (5pt, costs BLACK:7 base → BLACK:6 after BLACK:1 bonus) → L2_45 (2pt, costs WHITE:5 base → WHITE:1 after WHITE:4 bonus post-L3_82) → L2_46 (3pt, costs BLACK:6 base → BLACK:4 after BLACK:2 bonus post-L2_45). EXECUTION: T21 (now): Take BLACK:2 → BLACK:2, WHITE:1 (3 tokens). T22: Take BLACK:2 → BLACK:4. T23: Take BLACK:2 → BLACK:6. T24: Purchase L3_82 (spend BLACK:6) → 10 POINTS, gain WHITE:4 bonus. T25: Purchase L2_45 (spend WHITE:1, costs WHITE:1 after W:4 bonus) → 12 POINTS, gain BLACK:2 bonus. T26-27: Gather BLACK:4. T28: Purchase L2_46 (spend BLACK:4, costs BLACK:4 after BL:2 bonus) → 15 POINTS, WIN! WHY BLACK:2 (not 3-token spread)? Answer: Taking BLACK:2 accelerates gathering (6 tokens in 3 turns vs 4+ turns with 3-token strategy). Simple, clean execution—no token limit issues (peak at 7 tokens T23). ALTERNATIVE REJECTED: Taking free L1_37 + L2_44 first seems attractive (2 points in 2 turns) but extends timeline to T30 vs T28 (verified). Opponent threat: They need 7 more points. Fastest path: L2_46 (3pt, need BLACK:5 tokens, ~4 turns) + others (~6 more turns total) = ~T27-29. My T28 victory timeline beats this! BLACK:2 gathering starts NOW—fastest path to dominate BLACK-heavy late-game cards!

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:0, total 3 tokens. Score 8. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1. I have just purchased L3_85, leaving me with only 3 tokens. My token count is low, so I can take tokens without exceeding 10. I need to aim for my next purchase to score more points. Looking at the board, L2_46 (3 points, BLACK bonus) requires BLACK:6, effective BLACK:5 with my BLACK bonus 1. I have BLACK:0, need 5. L2_45 (2 points, BLACK bonus) requires WHITE:5, effective WHITE:4 with my WHITE bonus 1, I have WHITE:1, need 3. L2_44 (2 points, BLACK bonus) requires GREEN:5, RED:3, effective GREEN:2, RED:3 with my GREEN bonus 3, I have GREEN:0, RED:2, need GREEN:2, RED:1. L2_57 (2 points, WHITE bonus) requires RED:5, effective RED:5 (no RED bonus), I have RED:2, need 3. L3_82 (5 points) requires WHITE:3, BLACK:7, effective WHITE:2, BLACK:6 with bonuses, I have WHITE:1, BLACK:0, far away. L3_74 (5 points) requires RED:7, BLACK:3, effective RED:7, BLACK:2, I have RED:2, BLACK:0. L3_80 (4 points) requires BLACK:7, effective BLACK:6, I have BLACK:0. L3_78 (5 points) requires WHITE:7, BLUE:3, effective WHITE:6, BLUE:1, I have WHITE:1, BLUE:0. Among these, L2_44 is the closest because I have GREEN bonus 3, RED:2, and board has GREEN:4, RED:2 tokens. I can take GREEN and RED tokens to get closer. Also, note that I am close to noble N9 (GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). I have GREEN:3, RED:1 (after previous reasoning I had RED:1, but in current state I have RED:2? Wait, in current game state I have RED:2 tokens, and bonuses RED:0? Actually my bonuses show RED:0 because I have no RED bonus cards. But noble requires bonuses, not tokens. My bonuses: GREEN:3, RED:0, BLUE:2. So I need RED bonus 3 and BLUE bonus 1 more. So I should also consider acquiring RED and BLUE bonuses. L1_38 gives RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, RED:2. With my WHITE bonus 1, effective WHITE:1, RED:2. I have WHITE:1, RED:2, so I can afford it now! That's 0 points but gives a RED bonus, moving me closer to N9. Alternatively, I can take tokens to prepare for L2_44 or other cards. Let's check affordable cards right now: L1_38 cost WHITE:2, RED:2. With bonuses WHITE:1, RED:0, effective WHITE:1, RED:2. I have WHITE:1, RED:2, exactly enough. That would spend all my WHITE and RED tokens, leaving me with 0 tokens, but give me a RED bonus, increasing my RED bonus to 1. That is useful for N9 and future purchases. However, purchasing a 0-point card now may not be optimal because I have only 3 tokens; if I spend them all, I'll have 0 tokens and will need to take tokens next turn anyway. But purchasing L1_38 would give me a bonus and reduce my token count to 0, allowing me to take 3 tokens without returning any. That might be okay. However, I could also take tokens now to set up a bigger purchase next turn. If I take GREEN, RED, and another color, I can aim for L2_44. Let's calculate: L2_44 effective cost GREEN:2, RED:3 (since GREEN bonus 3). I have GREEN:0, RED:2. If I take 2 GREEN tokens and 1 RED token, I'll have GREEN:2, RED:3, plus other tokens. That would allow me to purchase L2_44 next turn for 2 points. That seems better than purchasing a 0-point card. Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:4, GREEN:4, RED:2, BLACK:2. I can take GREEN, RED, and BLUE (to help with BLUE for N9). Taking GREEN:1, RED:1, BLUE:1 gives me totals: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:0, total 6 tokens. That sets me up for L2_44 (needs GREEN:2, RED:3, I'd have GREEN:1, RED:3, so need one more GREEN). Alternatively, I could take 2 GREEN and 1 RED (allowed? Taking 2 of same color only if 4+ available. GREEN has 4, so I can take 2 GREEN. That would give me GREEN:2, RED:1, plus my existing RED:2, total RED:3. That works. But taking 2 of same color consumes an action that could be used for diversity. I think taking 3 different colors is more flexible. I'll take GREEN, RED, BLUE. This also denies opponent some tokens (opponent has strong GREEN bonuses). So my action: take_WHITE=0, take_BLUE=1, take_GREEN=1, take_RED=1, take_BLACK=0. No return needed.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: CRITICAL TURN 22 - Opponent threatens T27-28 victory, I need fastest path to 15! Current state: 5 points vs opponent's 8, I have WHITE:1/BLACK:2 tokens (3 total), bonuses WHITE:3/BLUE:2/GREEN:5/RED:1/BLACK:1. Board constraints: All token colors have <4 supply (WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2), so CANNOT use 2-of-same rule - must take 3 different colors. OPPONENT THREAT: They have GREEN:1/RED:3 tokens, bonuses WHITE:1/BLUE:2/GREEN:3/BLACK:1. T22 (opponent): Take GREEN:1→buy L2_44 (costs GREEN:2/RED:3 after bonuses, 2pt) T23→10 points, BLACK:2 bonus! Then gather BLACK:3 over T24-26, buy L2_46 T27→13 points. They win ~T28-29! MY OPTIMAL PATH - PURCHASE L2_45 NEXT TURN: L2_45 (2pt, WHITE bonus) costs WHITE:5 base→WHITE:2 after my WHITE:3 bonus. I have WHITE:1, need exactly WHITE:1 MORE! EXECUTION: T22 (NOW): Take WHITE:1+BLUE:1+GREEN:1 (all available on board✓, 3 different colors✓)→WHITE:2/BLACK:2/BLUE:1/GREEN:1 (6 tokens total, under 10 limit✓). T23: Purchase L2_45 (spend WHITE:2)→7 points, BLACK:2 bonus unlocked! T24-27: With BLACK:2 bonus, L2_46 costs BLACK:4 (I have BLACK:2). Gather BLACK:2 over 2 turns, purchase L2_46 T27→10 points, BLACK:3 bonus. Then L3_82 (5pt, costs BLACK:4 with BLACK:3 bonus) or L3_80 (4pt, BLACK:4). Path reaches 15 by T30-31. WHY NOT FREE CARDS (L1_37/L1_9)? Taking free 0-point cards delays actual scoring. L1_37→RED:2 helps L2_44 but extends timeline (need RED:3 gathering, 3 turns). WHITE path is FASTER - only need 1 token (this turn) then immediate 2-point purchase next turn! WHY NOT DENY L2_44? Buying L2_44 myself (need RED:3, 3 turns to gather) to block opponent delays me to T25 for 7 points vs T23 with L2_45. Opponent can pivot to other cards (L2_46 direct, needs BLACK:5 but takes similar time). VERIFICATION: Board has WHITE:2✓ BLUE:3✓ GREEN:3✓, taking 1 each is valid✓, results in 6 tokens (under 10)✓. This is my fastest path to score - must execute despite likely losing to opponent's lead!

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:0, GOLD:0, total 6 tokens (after last turn's reasoning I said I'd take BLUE, GREEN, RED, which matches current state). Score 8. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, RED:0. I need to reach 15 points. My token count is 6, so I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I should aim to purchase a point-scoring card soon. L2_44 (2 points, BLACK bonus) requires GREEN:5, RED:3; with my GREEN bonus 3, effective cost GREEN:2, RED:3. I have GREEN:1, RED:3, so I need 1 more GREEN token to afford it. L2_45 (2 points, BLACK bonus) requires WHITE:5, effective WHITE:4, I have WHITE:1, need 3 more. L2_46 (3 points, BLACK bonus) requires BLACK:6, effective BLACK:5, I have BLACK:0, far away. L2_57 (2 points, WHITE bonus) requires RED:5, effective RED:5, I have RED:3, need 2. L3_82 (5 points) requires WHITE:3, BLACK:7, effective WHITE:2, BLACK:6, far. L3_74 (5 points) requires RED:7, BLACK:3, effective RED:7, BLACK:2, far. L3_80 (4 points) requires BLACK:7, effective BLACK:6, far. L3_78 (5 points) requires WHITE:7, BLUE:3, effective WHITE:6, BLUE:1, I have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, still need WHITE:5. So L2_44 is closest. I could also consider purchasing L1_38 (0 points, RED bonus) to increase my RED bonus for noble N9 (requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). I have GREEN:3, BLUE:2, RED:0, so I need RED:3 and BLUE:1. Buying L1_38 would give me RED:1, moving me closer. However, it costs WHITE:2, RED:2, effective WHITE:1, RED:2 (since WHITE bonus 1). I have WHITE:1, RED:3, so I can afford it. But purchasing a 0-point card now might be suboptimal because I could instead take tokens to afford L2_44 next turn for 2 points. Also, opponent has strong bonuses and may be close to winning. I need points. Checking board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2. I can take GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK (to diversify). Taking GREEN:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 gives me totals: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:1, total 9 tokens. That puts me within reach of L2_44 (needs GREEN:2, RED:3, I'd have exactly that). However, I must verify the effective cost: L2_44 cost GREEN:5, RED:3. My GREEN bonus is 3, so effective GREEN:2. I would have GREEN:2 tokens, RED:3 tokens, so I can purchase it next turn. This is efficient. Alternatively, I could take 2 GREEN tokens (since GREEN has 2 available? Actually board shows GREEN:2, so I can only take 1 because taking 2 requires at least 4 tokens available. So I cannot take 2 GREEN. So I need to take 1 GREEN now, and then next turn I'll have GREEN:2, RED:3, which is exactly enough. But I also need to consider that opponent might take the last GREEN token or reserve/purchase L2_44. However, opponent's tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:0, and they have GREEN bonus 5, so they might want L2_64 (which they already have) or other GREEN cards. They could also be aiming for nobles. But I should prioritize my own progress. Taking GREEN, BLUE, BLACK also helps with noble N9 (BLUE and BLACK for future). I think taking tokens is best. I will take GREEN, BLUE, BLACK. This brings me to 9 tokens, no need to return any. Then next turn I can purchase L2_44 for 2 points, bringing me to 10 points. That's a solid step towards 15.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=3, GRN=6, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: TURN 23 EXECUTE CRITICAL L2_45 PURCHASE! Following Turn 22 strategy perfectly: I gathered WHITE:1 last turn reaching WHITE:2 total, now completing the planned purchase. VERIFICATION: L2_45 exists on board ✓, costs WHITE:5 base → WHITE:2 after my WHITE:3 bonus ✓, I have WHITE:2 tokens ✓. PURCHASE DELIVERS: (1) IMMEDIATE 2 POINTS: 5→7 points, narrowing opponent's 8-point lead to just 1 point gap! (2) BLACK:2 BONUS UNLOCK: Transforms future purchases - L2_46 changes from BLACK:5 needed to BLACK:4 needed (I have BLACK:2, only need 2 more tokens = 2 gathering turns vs 3). L3_82 reduces from BLACK:6 to BLACK:5 needed. (3) TOKEN PRESERVATION: Spending WHITE:2 preserves my BLACK:2 tokens for L2_46 path, maintaining strategic flexibility. POST-PURCHASE STATE: Tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:2 (4 total, room for gathering). Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:5, RED:1, BLACK:2. Score: 7 points. OPPONENT THREAT ANALYSIS: They have GREEN:2/RED:3 tokens with GREEN:3 bonus - they WILL buy L2_44 this turn (costs GREEN:2/RED:3 after bonuses) reaching 10 points + BLACK:2 bonus! Then they pursue L2_46 (needs BLACK:4 with BLACK:2 bonus, 3-4 turns gathering) reaching 13 points ~T27, then L2_57 (2pt, needs RED:2) for 15 points ~T29-30. CRITICAL BOARD CONSTRAINT: Only 1 token per color available (WHITE:1/BLUE:1/GREEN:1/RED:1/BLACK:1) severely limits gathering speed for both players! RACING TIMELINE: ME: T23 (now) buy L2_45→7pts. T24-25 gather BLACK:2→BLACK:4 total. T26 buy L2_46→10pts, BLACK:3 bonus. T27-30 gather BLACK:4. T31 buy L3_82 (5pt)→15pts! THEM: T23 L2_44→10pts. T24-26 gather BLACK:3. T27 L2_46→13pts. T28-29 gather RED:2. T30 L2_57→15pts! Race is EXTREMELY tight - they lead by 1 turn! But this is my ONLY scoring path - alternatives (gathering tokens without purchasing, or free 0pt cards) would extend timeline past T31 guaranteeing loss. MUST execute this purchase NOW!

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 9 tokens. Score 8. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, RED:0. In my previous reasoning, I planned to take tokens to afford L2_44. Now I have exactly the tokens needed: L2_44 requires GREEN:5, RED:3. With my GREEN bonus 3, effective cost is GREEN:2, RED:3. I have GREEN:2 tokens and RED:3 tokens, so I can purchase it now. Purchasing L2_44 gives 2 prestige points, bringing my total to 10, and provides a BLACK bonus, increasing my BLACK bonus to 2. This is efficient as it scores points and progresses my bonuses. Alternatively, I could consider purchasing L1_38 (0 points) to gain a RED bonus for noble N9, but points are more urgent. Opponent has 7 points and strong bonuses, so I need to maintain lead. Checking other affordable cards: L2_45 requires WHITE:5, effective WHITE:4, I have WHITE:1, cannot afford. L2_46 requires BLACK:6, effective BLACK:5, I have BLACK:1, cannot afford. L2_57 requires RED:5, effective RED:5, I have RED:3, cannot afford. L3 cards are too expensive. Therefore, purchasing L2_44 is the best immediate move to score points and stay on track to 15.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=6, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: TURN 24 - STRATEGIC BREAKTHROUGH: L2_61 DISCOVERED AS ULTRA-CHEAP 2-POINT TARGET! Current: 7 points vs opponent's 10 points. Critical analysis reveals L2_61 (2pt, GREEN bonus) costs WHITE:4/BLUE:2/BLACK:1 base → After my WHITE:3/BLUE:2/BLACK:2 bonuses = WHITE:1 ONLY! This is exceptionally cheap - 1 token for 2 points! OPTIMAL DUAL-PURPOSE GATHERING: Take WHITE:1 + BLACK:1 + RED:1 (board has WHITE:3✓, BLACK:1✓, RED:4✓). Result: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 (7 tokens, under 10 limit✓). PURPOSE: (1) WHITE:1 enables immediate L2_61 purchase T25 → 9 points! (2) BLACK:1 continues L2_46 preparation. EXECUTION TIMELINE: T24 (NOW): Gather WHITE:1/BLACK:1/RED:1. T25: PURCHASE L2_61 (spend WHITE:1) → 9 POINTS, GREEN:7 bonus total! Post-purchase: BLACK:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (6 tokens). T26: Gather BLACK:1 → BLACK:4 total. T27: PURCHASE L2_46 (costs BLACK:6 - BLACK:2 bonus = BLACK:4, spend BLACK:4) → 12 POINTS, BLACK:3 bonus! T28-29: Gather BLACK:2 → BLACK:2. T30: PURCHASE L3_82! Costs WHITE:3/BLACK:7 - WHITE:3/BLACK:5 = BLACK:2 only! → 17 POINTS, WIN! WHY THIS PATH WINS: (1) EFFICIENCY: L2_61 requires only 1 token for 2 points = fastest immediate scoring! (2) NO DELAY: BLACK:1 gathered simultaneously maintains L2_46 timeline. (3) L2_46 AMPLIFICATION: BLACK bonus from L2_46 reduces L3_82 cost from BLACK:6 to BLACK:2! (4) VICTORY BY T30: Opponent at 10 points needs ~T31-32 to reach 15 (their best paths: L2_61 T26→12pts, L2_46 T28→15pts or L2_57 paths all extend to T30-32). VERIFICATION: Taking 3 different colors = valid✓, board supply sufficient✓, results in 7 tokens✓. This gathering executes the critical pivot to capitalize on L2_61's ultra-low WHITE:1 cost!

Available face-up cards: L1_38 (0 pts, RED bonus), L1_4 (0 pts, BLACK), L1_37 (0 pts, RED), L1_9 (0 pts, BLUE); L2_46 (3 pts, BLACK), L2_57 (2 pts, WHITE), L2_61 (2 pts, GREEN), L2_59 (1 pt, GREEN); L3_82 (5 pts, WHITE), L3_74 (5 pts, BLACK), L3_80 (4 pts, WHITE), L3_78 (5 pts, BLUE). Nobles: N5 (RED4, BLACK4), N2 (GREEN4, RED4), N9 (GREEN3, RED3, BLUE3). My bonuses: WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN3, BLACK2, RED0. I am closest to noble N9: I have GREEN3, BLUE2, RED0 -> need BLUE1 and RED3. So acquiring RED bonuses is key. I could purchase L1_38 (RED bonus) for 0 points, but it would give me my first RED bonus. Cost: WHITE2, RED2. With my WHITE bonus 1, effective cost: WHITE1, RED2. I have WHITE1 token, but RED0 tokens. I need 2 RED tokens to buy it. Alternatively, I could take tokens to accumulate RED and maybe BLUE. Board tokens: WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN3, RED3, BLACK0, GOLD5. I can take up to 3 different colors. Since I have only 4 tokens, I can take 3 without exceeding 10. I should target colors that help me purchase a point-scoring card or get closer to noble. Considering point cards: L2_46 (3 pts, BLACK) cost BLACK6, effective BLACK4 (since BLACK bonus 2). I have BLACK1 token, need 3 more BLACK tokens. Board has BLACK0, so I can't take BLACK now. L2_57 (2 pts, WHITE) cost RED5, effective RED5. I have RED0, need 5 RED, board has RED3. L2_61 (2 pts, GREEN) cost WHITE4, BLUE2, BLACK1, effective WHITE3, BLUE0, BLACK? I have WHITE bonus 1, so WHITE3? Actually effective WHITE3, BLUE0 (since BLUE bonus 2), BLACK -1? Wait, bonuses reduce cost: WHITE4 - WHITE1 = 3, BLUE2 - BLUE2 = 0, BLACK1 - BLACK2 = -1 (so 0). So effective cost: WHITE3. I have WHITE1 token, need 2 WHITE. Board has WHITE2, so I could take WHITE and others. L2_59 (1 pt, GREEN) cost WHITE3, GREEN2, RED3, effective WHITE2, GREEN -1 (0), RED3. I have WHITE1, GREEN3, RED0 -> need WHITE1, RED3. Board has RED3. L3 cards are expensive, but maybe L3_78 (5 pts, BLUE) cost WHITE7, BLUE3, effective WHITE6, BLUE1. I have WHITE1, BLUE2 -> need WHITE5, BLUE -1? Actually BLUE3 - BLUE2 =1, so need BLUE1 token. But WHITE6 is far. L3_80 (4 pts) cost BLACK7, effective BLACK5, I have BLACK1, need 4, board BLACK0. L3_74 (5 pts) cost RED7, BLACK3, effective RED7, BLACK1, far. L3_82 (5 pts) cost WHITE3, BLACK7, effective WHITE2, BLACK5, far. So the most affordable point card appears to be L2_61 (2 pts) requiring only WHITE3 tokens after bonuses. I have WHITE1 token, need 2 more. I could take 2 WHITE tokens if available? Board has WHITE2, and taking 2 of same color requires at least 4 tokens available, which is not the case (only 2). So I must take 3 different colors, including WHITE. I could take WHITE, RED, and BLUE (to help with noble N9 and L2_61). That would give me WHITE+1, RED+1, BLUE+1, bringing my totals to WHITE2, BLUE3, GREEN0, RED1, BLACK1. That would allow me to purchase L2_61 next turn (effective WHITE3, I'd have WHITE2, still need 1 WHITE). Alternatively, I could take WHITE, RED, GREEN (but GREEN is less needed). Another option: purchase L1_38 now? I cannot afford because I need RED2 tokens. So I need to accumulate tokens. Since I have low token count, taking tokens is sensible. I should also consider opponent's position: opponent has strong GREEN bonuses and may be aiming for nobles or high-point cards. They have 7 points and could catch up. I should prioritize securing points. Perhaps I can aim for L2_57 (2 pts) which requires RED5, but that's longer term. Or L2_46 (3 pts) but BLACK tokens are scarce. L2_61 seems the most feasible with my bonuses. So I'll take WHITE, RED, BLUE. This also progresses my noble N9 (BLUE and RED). After taking, I'll have WHITE2, BLUE3, RED1, GREEN0, BLACK1. Next turn I could take another WHITE (if available) to afford L2_61, or purchase L1_38 if I get another RED token. But L1_38 gives no points, so points first. I should verify that L2_61 is still available: yes, it's in LEVEL_2 face-up cards. So my action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1, others 0. No return needed. This aligns with my token count: current 4 + 3 = 7 ≤ 10.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_44]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card L2_44 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 10 points, tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (total 4). Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:2, RED:0. I need 5 more points to win. Analyzing face-up cards, L1_37 costs BLUE:2, GREEN:1. With my bonuses (BLUE:2, GREEN:3), the effective cost is 0 for both colors, so I can purchase it for free without spending tokens. This gives me a RED bonus, increasing my RED bonus to 1, which progresses me toward noble N9 (requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). Purchasing this card uses my turn efficiently, as it improves my bonus structure at no token cost, leaving my tokens intact for future turns. Alternative actions like taking tokens would not yield an immediate benefit, and reserving a card would delay scoring. Since L1_37 is free and available on the board, this is the optimal move to advance my position while maintaining token flexibility.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=6, RED=2, BLK=5}
Reasoning: TURN 25 EXECUTE L2_61 PURCHASE - Following Turn 24 strategic plan perfectly! VERIFICATION: L2_61 exists on board✓, costs WHITE:4/BLUE:2/BLACK:1 base → After bonuses WHITE:3/BLUE:2/BLACK:2 = WHITE:1/BLUE:0/BLACK:0 = WHITE:1 ONLY required✓, I have WHITE:1 token✓. PURCHASE DELIVERS: (1) ULTRA-EFFICIENT SCORING: 2 points for just 1 token = best points-per-token ratio available! 7→9 POINTS, narrowing opponent's lead from 10-7=3 points to just 10-9=1 point gap! (2) GREEN:6 BONUS: Already have GREEN:5, gain GREEN:1 → total GREEN:6. (3) TOKEN PRESERVATION: Spending only WHITE:1 preserves critical BLACK:3 tokens for L2_46 path. Post-purchase: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 (6 tokens, excellent flexibility). BOARD CONSTRAINT ADAPTATION: BLACK:0 on board blocks both players from immediate BLACK gathering—but I already have BLACK:3! This constraint HELPS me by slowing opponent (they have BLACK:1, need BLACK:4 more for L2_46). REVISED TIMELINE: T25 (NOW): Purchase L2_61→9 points. T26: Board BLACK may refill, or pursue alternative path (L1_8 for BLACK:3 bonus if BLUE refills). T27: If BLACK refilled to BLACK:1+, gather BLACK:1→BLACK:4 total. T28: Purchase L2_46 (costs BLACK:6-BLACK:2=BLACK:4)→12 points, BLACK:3 bonus! T29-30: Gather BLACK:2. T31: Purchase L3_82 (costs BLACK:7-BLACK:5=BLACK:2)→17 POINTS! OPPONENT THREAT: They're at 10 points but also blocked by BLACK:0. Their best paths (L2_46 needs BLACK:4, L2_57 needs RED:4, L3_78 needs WHITE:6/BLUE:1) all require 4+ turns of gathering. My efficient L2_61 purchase maintains competitive position despite trailing by 1 point!

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 4 tokens. Score 10. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:2, RED:1. I need 5 more points to win. I must analyze affordable point-scoring cards. L2_57 (2 points, WHITE bonus) costs RED:5. With my RED bonus 1, effective cost RED:4. I have RED:0 tokens, so cannot afford. L2_59 (1 point, GREEN bonus) costs WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3. With bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, effective cost WHITE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2. I have WHITE:1, RED:0, need WHITE:1, RED:2. Not affordable. L2_43 (2 points, BLACK bonus) costs BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2. Bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, effective cost BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1. I have BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, so I need GREEN:1, RED:1 tokens to afford. That's close. I could take GREEN and RED tokens this turn to set up purchasing L2_43 next turn for 2 points. Alternatively, L1_8 (1 point, BLACK bonus) costs BLUE:4. With BLUE bonus 2, effective BLUE:2. I have BLUE:2 tokens, so I can afford L1_8 right now! Purchasing L1_8 would cost BLUE:2 tokens, leaving me with WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, total 2 tokens. It gives 1 point and a BLACK bonus (increasing BLACK to 3). That brings me to 11 points. That's progress. However, L1_8 is a level 1 card with 1 point, while L2_43 gives 2 points and a BLACK bonus as well (bringing BLACK to 3 also). But L2_43 requires additional tokens. I need to consider efficiency. I have 4 tokens now, could take 3 more tokens (up to 7) without returning. If I take GREEN and RED tokens (since board has GREEN:3, RED:3), I could take GREEN:1, RED:1, and another color (e.g., WHITE:1) to get closer to L2_43. After taking, I'd have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. Then next turn I'd need to purchase L2_43, costing BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, which I would have exactly. That yields 2 points. That's better than purchasing L1_8 for 1 point now. However, taking tokens delays scoring by one turn. But opponent is at 9 points and has strong bonuses; they could win soon. I need to score points quickly. Another option: check if I can afford any level 3 cards. L3_82 (5 points) costs WHITE:3, BLACK:7; effective WHITE:2, BLACK:5 (bonuses WHITE:1, BLACK:2). I have WHITE:1, BLACK:1, far. L3_74 (5 points) costs RED:7, BLACK:3; effective RED:6, BLACK:1. I have RED:0, BLACK:1, far. L3_80 (4 points) costs BLACK:7; effective BLACK:5, I have BLACK:1. L3_78 (5 points) costs WHITE:7, BLUE:3; effective WHITE:6, BLUE:1, I have WHITE:1, BLUE:2. Still far. So level 3 cards are out of reach without more tokens. Considering nobles: I am close to noble N9 (GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). I have GREEN:3, RED:1, BLUE:2. I need RED:2 more and BLUE:1 more. Purchasing L1_38 (RED bonus) would give me RED:2, but it costs WHITE:2, RED:2, effective WHITE:1, RED:2 (since WHITE bonus 1). I have WHITE:1, RED:0, cannot afford. I could take tokens to afford L1_38, but that's 0 points. Better to aim for points. Perhaps I should reserve a high-point card? But reserving doesn't score immediately. Given opponent's proximity to 15 (they have 9, but might be close due to nobles or big cards), I should prioritize scoring points now. Purchasing L1_8 gives 1 point immediately and improves my BLACK bonus, which might help with L2_46 (3 points) later. But L2_46 costs BLACK:6, effective BLACK:3 with BLACK bonus 3 after L1_8. I have BLACK:1 token, would need BLACK:2 more tokens. That's possible. However, I have only 4 tokens now, so taking tokens is necessary soon. Another consideration: purchasing L1_8 uses my BLUE tokens, which are needed for BLUE bonus for noble N9. But I have BLUE bonus 2, need BLUE:3 total for noble, so I need one more BLUE bonus card. L1_8 doesn't give BLUE bonus. Maybe I should aim for a BLUE bonus card instead. L1_9 gives BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. With bonuses, effective WHITE:0, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0? Wait, I have WHITE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2. So effective cost: WHITE:0, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0. That means I can purchase L1_9 for free! It gives 0 points but a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus to 3. That satisfies the BLUE requirement for noble N9. Then I only need RED:2 more bonuses to attract N9 (3 points). That's a good path: purchase L1_9 now, then next turn try to get a RED bonus card (like L1_38) or another card that gives RED bonus. However, purchasing L1_9 yields 0 points, delaying my point scoring. But it might secure a noble worth 3 points soon. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_8 for 1 point now, then next turn try to get L1_9 or another BLUE bonus. But I need to consider opponent's moves. They have 9 points, and might be aiming for a noble or big card. They have a reserved card L2_55 (2 points, WHITE bonus) that they could purchase soon. They also have many bonuses. I need to act fast. Let's compare: Option A: Purchase L1_8 (1 point, BLACK bonus). Score 11. Option B: Purchase L1_9 (0 points, BLUE bonus). Score stays 10. Option C: Take tokens to set up L2_43 (2 points) next turn. That gives 12 after two turns. Option D: Reserve a high-point card? Not helpful now. I think the best is to take tokens to set up L2_43 for 2 points, because that yields the most points in the next turn, and I also get a BLACK bonus (increasing to 3). That seems efficient. However, I need to ensure I don't leave opponent an opening. They might purchase L2_43 before me if I delay. But they have no RED tokens (0) and only 1 GREEN token, so they likely cannot afford L2_43 immediately. So I have time. Let's take tokens: I need GREEN:1 and RED:1 to afford L2_43. I also have room for a third token. I'll take WHITE:1 as well to have flexibility. Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:0. I can take WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. That's valid. After taking, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, total 7 tokens. Next turn I purchase L2_43 for 2 points, score becomes 12, and BLACK bonus becomes 3. That's good. Also, after that, I'll be closer to noble N9 (still need RED:2 bonuses). I'll also have tokens left to pursue other cards. So I will take WHITE, GREEN, RED tokens this turn.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_57]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_57
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 4 tokens. Score 10. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:2, RED:1 (after purchasing L1_37, which gave me a RED bonus). I need 5 more points to win. I previously attempted to purchase L2_57 but got an error due to insufficient tokens. Let's verify my current token situation and available cards. I have 4 tokens, so I can take tokens without returning any. However, taking tokens would delay scoring. I should prioritize purchasing an affordable card that gives points or improves my bonuses toward a noble. Examining face-up cards:

- L1_38: 0 points, RED bonus, cost WHITE:2, RED:2. With my bonuses (WHITE:1, RED:1), effective cost: WHITE:1, RED:1. I have WHITE:1, RED:0 tokens. I cannot afford because I lack 1 RED token. I need to check if I can use gold? I have 0 GOLD.

- L1_4: 0 points, BLACK bonus, cost GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1. With bonuses GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, effective cost: GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0. I have tokens GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1. I would need RED:2 tokens, which I don't have.

- L1_9: 0 points, BLUE bonus, cost WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. With bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, effective cost: WHITE:0, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0. I can purchase this for free! This gives a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus to 3. That's crucial for noble N9 (requires BLUE:3). After purchasing, my BLUE bonus becomes 3. I already have GREEN:3, RED:1, so I would need RED:2 more bonuses to attract N9. Purchasing L1_9 also costs no tokens, so I keep my tokens for future purchases. This is a highly efficient move to progress toward a noble and improve my engine.

- L1_8: 1 point, BLACK bonus, cost BLUE:4. With BLUE bonus currently 2, effective cost BLUE:2. I have BLUE:2 tokens, so I can afford it! This would give me 1 point and increase BLACK bonus to 3. That's also attractive, as it scores a point and improves bonuses. However, it spends my BLUE tokens, which are currently used for L1_9's free purchase. But if I purchase L1_9 first (free), then my BLUE bonus becomes 3, and then effective cost for L1_8 becomes BLUE:1, but I would have spent no tokens. Actually, I have BLUE:2 tokens, so after purchasing L1_9 (free), I still have BLUE:2 tokens, and then effective cost for L1_8 becomes BLUE:1 (since BLUE bonus 3), so I could afford it. However, I can only perform one action per turn. So I must choose between L1_9 (0 points, free, BLUE bonus) and L1_8 (1 point, cost BLUE:2 tokens). Purchasing L1_8 gives me an immediate point and improves BLACK bonus, but uses tokens. Purchasing L1_9 is free and progresses me toward noble N9 more directly (BLUE:3). Since I need 5 points, every point counts. But the noble N9 gives 3 points, and I'm close: after L1_9, I have GREEN:3, BLUE:3, RED:1. I need RED:2 more bonuses. There's L1_38 (RED bonus) but I can't afford now. I could aim to get RED bonuses later. However, the opponent is at 9 points and may be close to winning. I need to accelerate my scoring. L1_8 gives 1 point now, while L1_9 gives 0 points but sets up a potential noble. Which is better? Considering the board, there are still high-point cards available: L2_46 (3 points), L2_57 (2 points), L3_82 (5 points), etc. I need tokens to afford those. If I spend tokens on L1_8, I'll have fewer tokens for future purchases. But if I take L1_9 for free, I keep my tokens and improve my bonus, making future purchases cheaper. Also, with BLUE bonus 3, L1_8 becomes cheaper next turn. I think taking the free card L1_9 is the most efficient use of this turn. It doesn't cost tokens, and it gets me closer to a noble. Then next turn, I can either purchase L1_8 (if still available) or take tokens to afford a point card. I must also consider that opponent may take L1_9 or L1_8. But I am the current player, so I can act now. I'll verify L1_9 is on the board: yes, in LEVEL_1 face-up cards. Therefore, I will purchase L1_9. It's free, gives a BLUE bonus, and sets up noble N9.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_38]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_38
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 10 points, tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 4 tokens. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:2, RED:1. I need 5 more points to win. My last move attempted to purchase L1_38 but was invalid due to insufficient tokens (error: 'Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_38'). Looking at L1_38 cost: WHITE:2, RED:2. With my bonuses (WHITE:1, RED:1), effective cost is WHITE:1, RED:1. I have WHITE:1, RED:0, so I lack RED token. Indeed, I have RED:0, cannot afford. I must correct my move. Now, what can I do? I have 4 tokens, can take up to 3 without exceeding 10. I should aim to afford a point-scoring card. Checking affordable cards: L1_37 is already purchased (it's in my purchasedCards list, so not available). L2_44 also purchased. L2_57 (2 points) requires RED:5, effective RED:5, I have RED:0, far. L2_46 (3 points) requires BLACK:6, effective BLACK:4 (since BLACK bonus 2), I have BLACK:1, need 3. L2_45 (2 points) requires WHITE:5, effective WHITE:4, I have WHITE:1, need 3. L2_59 (1 point) requires WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, effective WHITE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2 (since GREEN bonus 3, RED bonus 1), I have WHITE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, need more. L2_43 (2 points) requires BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2, effective BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1 (since BLUE bonus 2, GREEN bonus 3, RED bonus 1), I have BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, need GREEN:1, RED:1. That's close. L3 cards are too expensive. Noble N9 is close: I need GREEN:3 (have), RED:3 (have 1), BLUE:3 (have 2). So I need RED bonus 2 more and BLUE bonus 1 more. I could aim for L1_38 (0 points, RED bonus) to get RED bonus, but I need tokens. I can take tokens to afford L2_43 or L1_38. Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:0. BLACK is 0, cannot take BLACK. I can take WHITE, GREEN, RED (all available). Taking WHITE, GREEN, RED would give me WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, total 7 tokens. That would allow me to purchase L2_43 next turn (needs GREEN:1, RED:1, which I'd have). Alternatively, I could take BLUE, GREEN, RED to get BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, which helps with N9 and L2_43. But BLUE only 1 available, so I can take 1 BLUE. I'll take WHITE, GREEN, RED. This also denies opponent some tokens. So action: take_WHITE=1, take_GREEN=1, take_RED=1. No returns needed.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=7, RED=2, BLK=5}
Reasoning: TURN 26 - BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: L2_43 ULTRA-EFFICIENT PATH! Current: 9 points vs opponent's 10. Critical constraint: BLACK:0 on board blocks both players from BLACK gathering! RE-ANALYSIS: My planned L2_46 purchase requires BLACK:4 total (I have BLACK:3, need BLACK:1 more)—IMPOSSIBLE with BLACK:0 on board! SOLUTION FOUND: L2_43 (2pt, BLACK bonus) costs BLUE:1/GREEN:4/RED:2 base → After bonuses BLUE:2/GREEN:6/RED:1 = RED:1 ONLY! PURCHASE DELIVERS: (1) IMMEDIATE 2 POINTS: 9→11 points, tying opponent! (2) BLACK:3 BONUS UNLOCK: Total BLACK:3 after existing BLACK:2! This transforms L2_46 from needing BLACK:4 (impossible without BLACK gathering) to BLACK:6-BLACK:3=BLACK:3 (exactly what I have)! (3) REMOVES BLACK:0 CONSTRAINT: With BLACK:3 bonus, L2_46 becomes immediately purchasable next turn using my existing BLACK:3 tokens—no BLACK gathering needed! EXECUTION TIMELINE: T26 (NOW): Purchase L2_43 (spend RED:1) → 11 POINTS, BLACK:3 bonus. Post-purchase: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:3 (4 tokens). T27: Purchase L2_46 (costs BLACK:6-BLACK:3=BLACK:3, spend BLACK:3) → 14 POINTS, BLACK:4 bonus! T28-29: Gather tokens for final scoring card (L1_8 needs BLUE:1 more, L2_59 needs RED:2, etc.). T29-30: Purchase final card → 15+ POINTS! OPPONENT THREAT: They're at 10 points with tokens WHITE:2/BLUE:2/GREEN:1/RED:1/BLACK:1. Best moves: (A) Buy L1_8 (costs BLUE:2)→11pts but then blocked by BLACK:0 for L2_46! (B) Gather RED tokens over 3-4 turns to buy L2_57→12pts, then need more gathering. Either path extends to T33+. My T29-30 victory beats this! WHY NOT TOKEN GATHERING? Taking 3 tokens delays by 1+ turns while giving 0 points. L2_43 gives 2 points NOW plus unlocks L2_46 path—strictly superior! WHY NOT FREE L1_9? 0 points doesn't advance victory timeline. VERIFICATION: L2_43 exists on board✓, costs RED:1 after bonuses (BLUE:1-BLUE:2=0, GREEN:4-GREEN:6=0, RED:2-RED:1=1)✓, I have RED:1✓, delivers critical BLACK:1 bonus for total BLACK:3✓. This purchase unlocks fastest path to 14 points despite BLACK:0 constraint!

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 10 points, tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 7 tokens. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2. I need 5 more points to win. Checking affordable cards: L1_38 cost WHITE:2, RED:2. With bonuses (WHITE:1, RED:1), effective cost is WHITE:1, RED:1. I have WHITE:2, RED:1, exactly enough. Purchasing L1_38 gives me a RED bonus, increasing my RED bonus to 2. This is crucial for noble N9 (requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). After this purchase, I will have GREEN:3, RED:2, BLUE:2, so I will need one more RED bonus and one more BLUE bonus to attract N9 for 3 points. Also, L1_38 is a zero-point card, but it improves my bonus structure without spending tokens (I pay WHITE:1, RED:1 tokens). After purchase, my tokens will be WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 5 tokens. This leaves me flexible for future purchases. Alternative actions: I could take tokens, but I already have 7 tokens and taking more would risk exceeding 10 or require discarding. I could purchase L2_43 (2 points), but its effective cost is BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1. I have BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, so I can afford it now. That gives 2 points, bringing me to 12, and a BLACK bonus. However, purchasing L1_38 first gets me closer to N9, and I can still purchase L2_43 next turn if I take a RED token (since I will have RED:0 after L1_38). But I must consider that opponent is at 11 points and may win soon. I need points quickly. Purchasing L2_43 now gives 2 points immediately, while L1_38 gives 0. However, N9 is worth 3 points and I am close. If I get L1_38 now, I need one more RED bonus and one BLUE bonus to get N9. That might take two more turns, but I can also aim for other point cards. Considering the board, there is L2_46 (3 points) requiring BLACK:6, effective BLACK:4 for me (BLACK bonus 2). I have BLACK:1, need 3 more BLACK tokens. That's possible. L2_57 (2 points) requires RED:5, effective RED:5, far. L2_59 (1 point) requires WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, effective WHITE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, I have WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, so need RED:1 more. L2_63 (2 points) requires GREEN:5, effective GREEN:2 (GREEN bonus 3), I have GREEN:1, need 1 more. So there are several 2-point cards within reach. I think getting the RED bonus now to progress toward N9 is valuable, but points are more urgent. Let's compare: If I purchase L2_43 now, I get 2 points and a BLACK bonus (total BLACK bonus 3). That also helps with L2_46 (effective BLACK:3 needed). After purchasing L2_43, my tokens become: spend BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, so tokens left: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, total 5. Then next turn I could take tokens to afford L2_63 (need GREEN:1) or L2_59 (need RED:1). But opponent might win before I get N9. Alternatively, if I purchase L1_38 now, I get RED bonus, then next turn I can purchase L2_43 (since I will have GREEN:1, RED:0, need RED:1, so I would need to take a RED token first). That delays points by one turn. However, L2_43 might be taken by opponent (they have strong BLACK bonuses). Actually, opponent has BLACK bonus 3, and L2_43 gives BLACK bonus, so they might want it. I should probably secure L2_43 now for the points and deny opponent. So I will purchase L2_43.

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=7, RED=1, BLK=6}
Reasoning: TURN 27 EXECUTE L2_46 PURCHASE FOR CHECKMATE! Following Turn 26's L2_43 purchase (which gave BLACK:3 bonus), I now have the perfect setup: BLACK:3 tokens + BLACK:3 bonus makes L2_46 affordable! VERIFICATION: L2_46 exists on board✓, costs BLACK:6 base - BLACK:3 bonus = BLACK:3 required✓, I have BLACK:3 tokens✓. PURCHASE DELIVERS: (1) MASSIVE 3-POINT LEAP: 11→14 points, overtaking opponent's 10 points decisively! (2) BLACK:4 BONUS: Unlocks future L3 cards (L3_82 would need BLACK:7-BLACK:4=BLACK:3 only). (3) MULTIPLE WIN PATHS: Path A (preferred): T28 buy L2_63 (FREE! costs GREEN:5-GREEN:6=0)→16 points WIN! Path B (if opponent steals L2_63): T28 take BLUE:1, T29 buy L1_8 (costs BLUE:4-BLUE:2=BLUE:2)→15 points WIN! OPPONENT BLOCKING ANALYSIS: They're at 10 points with WHITE:1/BLUE:2/GREEN:1/BLACK:1, bonuses WHITE:1/BLUE:2/GREEN:3/RED:2/BLACK:2. Can they prevent my win? (A) Buy L2_46 themselves? NO - they need BLACK:6-BLACK:2=BLACK:4 but only have BLACK:1✗. (B) Reserve L2_46 to block me? Possible but terrible for them - denies them scoring while I pivot to L2_63 (FREE 2pt card!) or L1_8 path. (C) Buy L2_63? Need GREEN:5-GREEN:3=GREEN:2, have GREEN:1, must gather first (1 turn delay). Can't beat my T28 checkmate! (D) Buy L1_8? Costs BLUE:4-BLUE:2=BLUE:2 (they have BLUE:2), gives 1pt→11pts, but then I buy L2_63 T28 for 16 points and win! CRITICAL INSIGHT: L2_63 (2pt, GREEN bonus) costs GREEN:5-GREEN:6 bonus=0 for me but GREEN:2 net for opponent (they need to gather). This asymmetry guarantees my T28 victory unless opponent wastes their turn blocking instead of scoring! WHY NOT L2_63 FIRST? If I buy L2_63 now→13pts, opponent could reserve L2_46 (blocking me from 3pt card), forcing me into slower L1_8 path (need 2 turns: gather BLUE:1, then purchase) extending to T30. By buying L2_46 now, I secure the 3-point card immediately, reach 14 points, and maintain flexibility for T28 checkmate via L2_63 or pivot to L1_8! VICTORY TIMELINE: T27 (NOW): Purchase L2_46→14 points. T28: Purchase L2_63 (FREE!)→16 POINTS, GAME OVER! This is the fastest possible path to victory given current board state!

Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 10 points, tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 5. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:2. Opponent has 14 points and can win immediately by purchasing L2_63 (2 points, cost GREEN:5), which is free for them due to GREEN bonus 6. I must block this by reserving L2_63. Purchasing L2_63 myself is not feasible this turn as I need one more GREEN token. Reserving it denies opponent the win and gives me a gold token. After reserving, I can aim to attract N9 or purchase other cards on subsequent turns. This is the most urgent move to prevent opponent from reaching 15 points.

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=7, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: TURN 28 EXECUTE L1_9 FREE PURCHASE FOR CHECKMATE SETUP! Critical discovery: My Turn 27 plan assumed L2_63 was available, but it's actually RESERVED by my opponent—CANNOT buy it! Re-analysis required. Current: 14 points vs opponent's 10 points. Tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:1 (2 total). BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: L1_9 is FREE and unlocks instant victory! VERIFICATION: L1_9 exists on board✓. Costs WHITE:1/GREEN:1/RED:1/BLACK:1 base - my bonuses WHITE:3/GREEN:6/RED:1/BLACK:4 = ALL ZERO✓. Gives BLUE bonus. PURCHASE DELIVERS: (1) FREE CARD: 0 tokens spent, preserves BLUE:1 for next turn! (2) BLUE:3 BONUS UNLOCK: Current BLUE:2 + new BLUE:1 = BLUE:3 total! This transforms L1_8 from costing BLUE:4-2=BLUE:2 (unaffordable with BLUE:1 token) to BLUE:4-3=BLUE:1 (exactly what I have)! (3) INSTANT VICTORY PATH: T28 (NOW) buy L1_9→14pts, BLUE:3 bonus. T29 buy L1_8 (costs BLUE:1, I have BLUE:1)→15 POINTS, WIN! OPPONENT BLOCKING ANALYSIS: They have BLUE:2, could buy L1_8 first (costs BLUE:4-2=BLUE:2). If so, my backup: T29 gather tokens, T30 buy L2_51 (costs BLUE:5-3=BLUE:2)→16pts WIN! Opponent needs ~T32 to reach 15 (L2_63 T30→13pts, then 2+ turns for final 2pts). Either path guarantees my victory T29-30! WHY NOT GATHER TOKENS? Wastes turn and opponent could steal L1_8 while I gather. Free L1_9 purchase LOCKS IN BLUE:3 bonus immediately, enabling both primary (L1_8 T29) and backup (L2_51 T30) winning paths. Zero tokens spent for maximum strategic gain—mathematically optimal!

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Opponent is at 14 points and can win immediately by purchasing L1_8, which costs BLUE:4. Their BLUE bonus is 3, so effective cost is BLUE:1, and they have BLUE:1 token. To prevent this, I must remove L1_8 from the board. Purchasing it myself gives me 1 point (score to 11) and denies it to opponent. After this, opponent cannot purchase any point card immediately (L2_57, L2_56, L2_59 require RED tokens they lack; L2_51 requires more BLUE tokens). They will likely take tokens, giving me a chance to reserve L2_51 on my next turn to block their future win condition. This sequence delays opponent's win and allows me to progress toward 15 points with my reserved L2_63 and other cards.

Turn 29 - Player 0's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=7, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: TURN 29 - OPPONENT BLOCKED L1_8 PURCHASE! Critical discovery: My Turn 28 plan to buy L1_8 failed because opponent purchased it on their turn! I'm at 14 points, need 1 more to win. RE-ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE CARDS: L1_33 and L1_20 are FREE (all costs covered by bonuses) but give 0 points—doesn't advance me to 15. L2_51 (2pt BLUE bonus) costs BLUE:5 base - BLUE:3 bonus = BLUE:2 net. I have BLUE:1, need BLUE:1 more! WINNING PATH DISCOVERED: T29 (NOW): Take BLUE:1 + WHITE:1 + BLACK:1 (3 different colors, valid✓). Board has WHITE:3✓, BLUE:3✓, BLACK:3✓. Result: BLUE:2, WHITE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (5 tokens total, under 10 limit✓). T30: Purchase L2_51 (spend BLUE:2) → 16 POINTS, WIN! WHY THIS WINS: (1) GUARANTEED VICTORY: L2_51 gives 2 points → 14+2=16 points on T30! (2) OPPONENT CAN'T CATCH UP: They're at 11 points with fastest path being L2_63 (need GREEN:2 net, have GREEN:1) requiring T30 gather + T31 purchase → only 13 points by T31. Even if they score 4 points by T32, I win on T30 first! (3) SINGLE-TURN DELAY: Only 1 turn needed before checkmate, minimizes opponent's response options. WHY NOT FREE CARDS NOW? L1_33/L1_20 give 0 points and don't unlock any immediate scoring opportunities—wasted turn. WHY NOT OTHER TOKENS? BLUE:1 is mandatory for L2_51. WHITE:1 and BLACK:1 chosen for potential backup cards (L3_82, L3_80) if unexpected board changes occur, though victory via L2_51 is locked. VERIFICATION: Taking 3 different colors = valid✓, board supply sufficient (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, BLACK:3)✓, results in 5 tokens (under 10)✓, enables L2_51 purchase T30✓. This is the fastest and most certain path to victory!

Turn 29 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 11 points, tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 4). Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:3. Opponent is at 14 points and can win on their next turn by purchasing L1_8 (1 point), which would bring them to 15. I must deny them that card. I can afford L1_8: cost BLUE:4. My BLUE bonus is 2, so effective cost is BLUE:2. I have BLUE:0 tokens, but I have 1 GOLD token that can substitute for 1 BLUE. I still need 1 more BLUE. However, I can use my GOLD as a wildcard to cover one BLUE, and then I need 1 BLUE token. But I don't have any BLUE tokens. Wait, re-calc: Effective cost BLUE:2. I have BLUE:0 tokens, GOLD:1. Using GOLD as BLUE, I still need 1 BLUE. I cannot afford it this turn because I lack the second BLUE token. However, I can take tokens to get a BLUE token, but then I would have to take exactly 3 tokens of different colors or 2 of the same. Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:2. I could take BLUE, GREEN, and another color. But if I take tokens, I cannot also purchase L1_8 in the same turn. I must either take tokens or purchase, not both. So I cannot purchase L1_8 this turn because I cannot afford it. I need to reconsider. Actually, I have a GOLD token, but I need to cover 2 BLUE. I can use GOLD for one, but I need another BLUE token. I have no BLUE tokens. So I cannot purchase L1_8 now. That means my previous reasoning about purchasing L1_8 to block opponent was flawed because I can't afford it. I need to block it by reserving it instead. I can reserve L1_8, which will remove it from the board and give me a gold token (if available). This denies opponent the card and gives me an extra gold. That is the correct blocking move. So action: RESERVE_CARD with card_id L1_8. After reserving, I will have 2 gold tokens (since I currently have 1, and I get 1 for reserving if available). Board has 4 gold tokens, so yes. This prevents opponent from winning with L1_8. Also, I have a reserved card L2_63 (2 points) that I can later purchase when I have enough GREEN tokens (cost GREEN:5, my GREEN bonus 3, effective GREEN:2, I have GREEN:1 token, need 1 more). But first, I must block opponent's immediate win. So I will reserve L1_8.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_8]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card L1_8 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 11 points, tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1, total 4 tokens. Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:3. Opponent is at 14 points and can win next turn if they purchase L2_57, L2_56, L2_59, or L2_51. I need to block them and advance my own position. I have a reserved L2_63 (cost GREEN:5, gives 2 points, GREEN bonus) which I could purchase next turn if I get one more GREEN token. However, my immediate goal is to prevent opponent from winning. Opponent has strong bonuses: GREEN:6, BLUE:3, etc. They can afford L2_57 (RED:5) with tokens? They have RED bonus 1, so effective RED:4 needed. They have RED:0 tokens, but they could take tokens. They have 5 tokens total, so they could take up to 3 more. L2_57 is 2 points, which would bring them to 16 and win. I must block L2_57, but it's on the board and I cannot reserve it because I already have one reserved card (max 3, I have 1). I could purchase it myself, but I lack RED tokens (I have RED:0, RED bonus 2, effective RED:3 needed, I have no RED tokens). Not feasible. I could reserve L2_57, but I'd have to discard a reserved card? No, I can have up to 3 reserved cards, I have 1, so I can reserve another. But reserving L2_57 would cost me a turn and give me a gold token. That might be worth it to block opponent. However, opponent could also win with L2_56 (RED:5, BLACK:3). Their RED bonus 1, BLACK bonus 4, so effective RED:4, BLACK:0. They have RED:0, BLACK:1 token. They need 4 RED tokens, which they could take. L2_59 (WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3): their bonuses WHITE:3, GREEN:6, RED:1, so effective WHITE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2. They have WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0 tokens. They need RED:2 tokens. L2_51 (BLUE:5): their BLUE bonus 3, effective BLUE:2, they have BLUE:2 tokens, so they can purchase L2_51 right now! Wait, check: opponent's tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, total 5. Bonuses: BLUE:3. L2_51 cost BLUE:5. Effective cost BLUE:2 (since bonus 3). They have BLUE:2 tokens exactly. So they can purchase L2_51 this turn for 2 points, bringing them to 16 and winning. I must block that. How? I can reserve L2_51, removing it from the board. That's the most urgent move. Alternatively, I could purchase L2_51 myself, but I have BLUE bonus 2, effective BLUE:3 needed. I have BLUE:0 tokens, so I need 3 BLUE tokens, not possible now. So I must reserve L2_51. That's a RESERVE_CARD action with card_id="L2_51". I will also get a gold token if available (there are 4 gold tokens on board). After reserving, I will have 2 reserved cards (L2_63 and L2_51). That blocks opponent's immediate win. My next turn I can aim to purchase L2_63 (need GREEN token) or work toward N9 (I need RED:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3; I have RED:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, so need RED:1 and BLUE:1 more). I could also purchase my reserved L2_55 (cost GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2) with my bonuses (GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:3) effective GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0, I need RED:2 tokens, I have RED:0, so not yet. So reserving L2_51 is critical.

VERIFICATION: L2_51 exists on board✓, costs BLUE:5 base - BLUE:3 bonus = BLUE:2 net✓, I have BLUE:2 tokens✓. PURCHASE L2_51 DELIVERS INSTANT VICTORY: (1) 2 PRESTIGE POINTS: 14→16 POINTS, GAME OVER! (2) OPPONENT CANNOT RESPOND: They're at 11 points, even if they score on their turn (best case L2_63 reserved needs gather first), I win THIS TURN before they can catch up! (3) PERFECT EXECUTION: Took BLUE token T29, purchase T30 = 2-turn checkmate exactly as planned! This is the fastest possible victory path. No other card on board gives me points that I can afford: L2_57/56/59 need RED tokens I don't have, L3 cards need 3+ BLACK/WHITE tokens I lack, free L1 cards give 0 points. L2_51 is the ONLY winning move available, and it wins NOW! VICTORY TIMELINE COMPLETE: T25 L2_61→9pts, T26 L2_43→11pts, T27 L2_46→14pts, T28 L1_9→14pts+BLUE:3, T29 gather BLUE:1→BLUE:2, T30 L2_51→16 POINTS VICTORY!

Turn 30 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with 11 points, tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 4). Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:3. I need 4 more points to win. I have L2_63 reserved (cost GREEN:5, bonus GREEN, 2 points). With my GREEN bonus of 3, effective cost is GREEN:2. I have GREEN:1 token, so I need 1 more GREEN. However, I have 1 gold token which can substitute for any color. Using the gold token for GREEN, I can cover the missing GREEN, allowing me to purchase L2_63. This yields 2 points, bringing me to 13, and increases my GREEN bonus to 4. After purchase, my tokens will be WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (total 3). Alternative actions: I could purchase L2_59 (1 point) but need more tokens; L2_57 and L2_56 are too expensive. I could take tokens to prepare for other purchases, but purchasing L2_63 now gives me points and brings me closer to winning. Additionally, I have noble N9 in reach (requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3). I currently have GREEN:3 (will become 4), RED:2, BLUE:2. I need one more RED and one more BLUE bonus to attract N9 for 3 points, which would then bring me to 16 total (13+3). That's a clear path to win. I should focus on acquiring bonuses for RED and BLUE. However, I must also consider that opponent is at 16 points and could win on their next turn. I need to win before they do. They are close to purchasing a high-point card? Checking their bonuses: opponent has GREEN:6, BLUE:4, etc. They could afford L3_74? That costs RED:7, BLACK:3. Their bonuses: RED:1, BLACK:4. Effective cost RED:6, BLACK:0. They have no RED tokens? They have tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0. They cannot afford it. L3_78 costs WHITE:7, BLUE:3. Their bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:4, effective WHITE:4, BLUE:0. They need WHITE tokens. They have WHITE:1, so they need 3 more WHITE tokens. L3_82 costs WHITE:3, BLACK:7. Their bonuses: WHITE:3, BLACK:4, effective WHITE:0, BLACK:3. They have BLACK:1 token, need 2 more BLACK. They could possibly afford L3_82 in two turns if they take tokens. But I might be able to win in two turns if I purchase L2_63 now, then next turn purchase something else for points, or attract N9. My path: After purchasing L2_63, I will have 13 points. To get to 15, I need 2 more points. I could purchase L2_59 (1 point) and attract N9 (3 points) for total 17, but that's two separate actions. Better: Next turn I could purchase L2_47 (1 point) if affordable, or reserve something. But I also need to block opponent. However, my immediate move should be to gain points. Purchasing L2_63 is correct. I must ensure I can afford it. Using gold token as GREEN. So action: purchase L2_63.
