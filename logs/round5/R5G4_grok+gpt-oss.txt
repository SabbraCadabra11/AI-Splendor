Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: This is turn 1, start of the game. I have no tokens, no bonuses, 0 points. All cards are available. The cheapest purchasable card is L1_40 (1 prestige point + RED bonus for 4 WHITE). Reserving it secures it from the opponent, prevents them from taking or reserving it, and gives me 1 GOLD token (joker, valuable for flexibility). GOLD will cover 1 WHITE, so I only need 3 WHITE tokens to buy it next few turns (e.g., take 2 WHITE next turn, 1 later). Early point + bonus is efficient. Other L1 cards cost more total gems and give 0 points. Higher levels too expensive now. Taking tokens risks opponent targeting WHITE (only 4 available) or reserving L1_40 themselves. Prioritize securing this efficient card and getting GOLD.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_40, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: I’ll take two white tokens now to start building a fast path to buy the Level‑1 card L1_34 (cost 2W,1B,1G,1Bl) on my next turn. This gives me a RED bonus and positions me to pursue a prestige card soon. The action is legal because the board has 4 white tokens available, so I can take 2 of the same color. No tokens need to be returned.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GLD=1}
Reasoning: I reserved L1_40 last turn (1pt + RED bonus for 4 WHITE), have 1 GOLD (covers 1 WHITE effectively). Need 3 WHITE tokens total. Board has 2 WHITE, cannot take 2 WHITE (only 2 available <4 required for double). Must take 1 WHITE + 2 other different colors via 3 different. Choose RED and BLACK: RED for upcoming bonus synergy, BLACK useful for L1_34/L2_46/nobles. After this: tokens GOLD1 WHITE1 RED1 BLACK1 (covers 2/4 WHITE). Opponent (2 WHITE) likely targets L1_20 (3W1B1Blk 0pt WHITE bonus). If they take last WHITE+1B+1Blk and buy, they return 3W to board, refilling WHITE for my next purchase. If not, WHITE remains. Post-purchase: 1pt + RED bonus, efficient early scoring. Cannot purchase yet. No better reserves. Tokens total 1+3=4 <=10, no returns.

Reasoning: We need to situate from....?
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, BLACK=201}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=129, BLUE=46, RED=1, BLACK=4}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.
Reasoning: We have 2 white tokens but the board only has 1 white left, so we cannot take 2 white. To buy the Level‑1 card L1_34 next turn, we need the remaining 3 tokens: 1 blue, 1 green, and 1 black. These colors are available in sufficient quantity (4 blue, 4 green, 3 black). Taking them keeps our token count at 5 (2 + 3), well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are needed. This is a legal TAKE_TOKENS action.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: I have 1W,1R,1Blk,1Gold (equiv 2W for L1_40). Board has 1W left - must take it to progress toward 4W needed. Can't take 2W (only 1 avail). Take 3 different: 1W +1R (synergy with upcoming RED bonus) +1Blk (versatile for L2_46, nobles N10, L1_34 etc.). Post-take: 2W,2R,2Blk,1Gold (equiv 3W). Total 7 <=10, no returns. Opponent has exactly tokens for L1_34 (2W1B1G1Blk, RED bonus 0pt) - likely buys it on their turn, returning 2W to board (refills W for me). If not (e.g., reserves L1_20), board W=0 but I have strong position with doubled R/Blk/W-equiv. Can't purchase anything now. No need to reserve (already have L1_40 secured; opponent can't touch it). Next: likely take more W post-opponent buy, then purchase L1_40 (1pt + RED bonus). Efficient early engine build while denying W scarcity. Avoids wasting turn.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: We currently have 5 tokens (2W,1B,1G,1Bk). All level‑1 cards are purchasable only by L1_34, which costs 2W,1B,1G,1Bk and would leave us with 0 tokens after purchase.  If we buy L1_34 now, we would need two more turns to accumulate enough tokens to buy a card that gives a color bonus (the only feasible bonus card is L1_18).  By instead taking three distinct tokens – one blue, one green, and one red – we increase our token total to 8 (2W,2B,2G,1R,1Bk).  These tokens exactly match the cost of L1_18, so we can buy it on our next turn, immediately acquiring a white bonus.  This plan uses a single turn to position ourselves for a bonus‑producing card, whereas buying L1_34 first would delay that step by one turn.  The token supply allows the take (board has ≥1 of each requested color), and the final total (5+3=8) does not exceed the 10‑token limit, so no tokens need to be returned.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current tokens: 2W, 2R, 2Blk, 1G (total 7). Reserved L1_40 (4W cost, 1pt RED bonus). Short 1W equivalent to buy it (2W +1G =3W equiv). Board: 0W, cannot take W. Opponent at 8 tokens: exactly can buy L1_34 (2W1B1G1Blk, 0pt RED bonus). If I take 1B1R1Blk (possible, to 10 tokens, deny board R/Blk), opponent still buys L1_34 (doesn't need board tokens), goes to ~3 tokens. Then I at 10, still short W for L1_40, can buy L1_34 (with new 1B +1G as GREEN +2W+1Blk) but 0pt. Wasteful. No W incoming. Instead, RESERVE L1_34: denies opponent the buy (secures RED bonus for me if wanted), gain 1G (now 2G total tokens=8). Next turn, buy L1_40 paying 2W +2G (as W) exactly, left with 2R 2Blk. Get 1pt + RED bonus immediately after. Opponent cannot buy L1_34. If opponent buys L1_18 instead (WHITE bonus), fine. If they take 3 (B/G/R/Blk avail), go to 11 return 1 (possibly W, but unneeded now). Perfect: solves W shortage via extra G, denies opponent key card, early point + bonus. Cannot purchase now. No better reserve (e.g., L2_46 too far). Efficient.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Malformed JSON response: Unexpected character ('<' (code 60)): was expecting a colon to separate field name and value
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any prestige card this turn. I want to save my current tokens for the upcoming Level‑2 card. My plan is to buy L2_61 soon, but it requires 4 white tokens – I have none on the board – so I will need at least 2 gold tokens to cover the missing white tokens. Reserving L2_61 gives me a gold token immediately and also holds the card for me, preventing my opponent from taking it. I will reserve another card later to get the second gold token, then purchase L2_61 using my 2W, 2B, 1K tokens and the two gold tokens. Reserving L2_61 is a good first move as it gives me a gold token and locks the card for my future purchase while keeping my token count unchanged.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Current tokens: 2W,2R,2Blk,2G (total 8). Reserved L1_40 (4W cost, 1pt RED bonus) and L1_34 (2W1B1G1Blk, 0pt RED bonus). Exactly can buy L1_40 now: pay 2W + 2G (as 2W). Post-buy: 1pt + RED bonus, left with 2R + 2Blk (total 4 tokens). Efficient early scoring and engine start (RED bonus helps many cards: L1_18/27, L2_44/67, L3_74/73, noble N10/N2). Cannot buy L1_34 yet (no B/G). Board 0W, so no token taking for W progress. No need to reserve more (L1_34 already secured; opponent reserved L2_61 which they can't buy yet - short 1W equiv with 2W+1G=3 vs 4W needed). Opponent at 9 tokens (2W2B2G1R1Blk1G), might take 1 token (but at 9, taking 3 would require return 2, wasteful) or reserve/buy (can't buy). Buying L1_40 advances me to 1pt while keeping position strong for next turns: take tokens toward L1_34 or board buys like L1_5/L1_18, build toward L2_46 (Blk bonus synergy) or nobles. Prioritize points over more reserves. No critical mistakes: card exists in my reserved, affordable exactly, no token take/return needed.

Reasoning: I have 9 tokens (2W,2B,2G,1R,1Bk,1Gld). The face‑up card L1_18 costs 1B,1G,1R,1Bk, which I can pay. Purchasing it gives a white bonus, reducing future white costs. I plan to buy L2_61 in two turns (after taking tokens), which gives 2 prestige points. This is an efficient path toward 15 points, and buying L1_18 now secures it from the opponent.

======================================================================================

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current position: 1pt from L1_40, RED x1 bonus, tokens 2R + 2Blk (strong for BLACK/RED heavy cards like L2_46 Blk6 3pt, L3_74/73 R/Blk heavy, N10 W3R3Blk3). Reserved L1_34 (another RED bonus, cheap but 0pt, safe). Cannot buy anything now: L1_34 needs 2W1B1G1Blk (have Blk but missing others); board L1s need missing colors (e.g., L1_5 needs G2 after RED covers R1). Opponent: 0pt, WHITE x1, tokens 2W1B1G (low threat, reserved expensive L2_61 W4B2Blk1 -> effective W3B2Blk1, short). Board: W2 B3 G4 R2 Blk2 Gold4. Only double possible: 2 GREEN (4>=4 avail). Take 2 GREEN to position for immediate next-turn buy of L1_5 (G2 R1 -> pay G2 with RED bonus, gain BLACK bonus 0pt). Post-take: 2G 2R 2Blk (6<=10, no return). Post-buy next: bonuses RED1 BLACK1, tokens 2R 2Blk, engine for L2_46 (Blk6->5), L3_74 (R7 Blk3 -> R6 Blk2), L3_73 (G3 R6 Blk3 -> G3 R5 Blk2), N10 (R3->2 Blk3->2). Superior to pursuing L1_34 (second RED good but BLACK unlocks higher pt cards faster; L1_34 can wait). Alternatives worse: 3 diff (e.g., 1W1B1G for L1_34) shorts 1W, no immediate buy; reserve L2_46 gets Gold but delays bonus acquisition; taking R/Blk piles up but no buy next turn. L1_5 safe (opponent can't buy). Efficient: bonuses > tokens, points soon via engine. No mistakes: GREEN 4 avail, valid 2-same, total 6<=10, no card action.

After this, I can take tokens on the next turn and buy L2_61, gaining 2 prestige points and a green bonus.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current position: 1pt, RED x1 bonus, tokens 2G 2R 2Blk (total 6). Reserved L1_34 (future). Can buy L1_5 immediately: cost G2 R1, RED bonus covers R1 exactly, pay G2. Post-buy: 0pt but gain BLACK x1 bonus (now RED1 BLACK1), left with 2R 2Blk (4 tokens). Accelerates engine perfectly for high-value BLACK/RED cards: L2_46 (Blk6->5), L3_74 (R7 Blk3 -> R6 Blk2 exactly next if take), L3_73 (G3 R6 Blk3 -> G3 R5 Blk2), N10 (W3 R3 Blk3 -> W3 R2 Blk2), L2_44 (G5 R3 -> G5 R2), N2 (G4 R4 -> G4 R3). L1_5 safe (opponent can't buy: lacks G2 R1, Gold2 insufficient). Opponent likely buys reserved L1_20 next (W2 B1 Gold as Blk1, with WHITE1 bonus reduces W3->2), gaining WHITE x2 bonus (still 0pt, low threat; their L2_61 reserved remains hard). Cannot buy L1_34 (missing 2W 1B 1G despite G2 Blk2). No better board buys: L1_27 needs B1 (none) R2(covered but B missing), L1_1 needs W B G R (missing many), L1_37 needs B2 G1 (no B). Taking tokens delays bonus acquisition (e.g., 2G but already have them; 3 diff like 1W1B1G for L1_34 shorts 1W1Blk). Reserving L2_46 gets Gold but no immediate progress. Prioritize buying for bonus now: unlocks mid/high game faster. Opponent at low score/threat. Tokens 6<=10, no returns needed. No mistakes: L1_5 on board L1, affordable exactly.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: We plan to buy L2_61 next turn. To do that, we need 1 white, 1 blue, 1 black token. We already have 2 white tokens and 1 white bonus, giving us effectively 3 white tokens; we need 1 more white token. We have 2 gold tokens to cover missing white. We also need a black token; we can take it from the board. We already have a blue token. Additionally, we take 1 green token to prepare for future purchases. This gives us 1 blue, 1 green, 1 black tokens. After purchase, we will use 1 gold token for missing white and the black token. We'll keep 1 gold token for future uses. This move keeps us within the 10‑token limit and positions us to buy L2_61 next turn, giving 2 prestige points. No tokens need to be returned.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current position: 1pt, bonuses RED1 BLACK1, tokens 2R 2Blk (total 4). Reserved L1_34 (future RED2). No immediate purchases possible (L1_34 short W2 B1 G1; board L1s missing colors). Opponent 0pt WHITE1, 8 tokens, reserved L1_20/L2_61, likely buys L1_20 next (exact tokens W2 B1 Blk1 effective, gains WHITE2). Board tokens ample for 3 diff take. Cannot take 2-same (no color >=4). Optimal: TAKE 1W 1B 1G to exactly enable next-turn purchase of L1_1 (cost W1 B1 G1 R1 -> RED1 covers R1, pay W1 B1 G1). Post-buy: gain BLACK2 bonus (0pt), left 2R 2Blk (4 tokens). BLACK2 unlocks L2_46 (Blk6 -> Blk4), L3_74 (R7 Blk3 -> R6 Blk1), L3_73 (G3 R6 Blk3 -> G3 R5 Blk1), L3_71 etc., N10 req (W3 R3 Blk3 -> W3 R2 Blk1). Superior engine ramp. L1_1 low threat from opponent (can but prioritizes reserved L1_20 for WHITE synergy; history shows buying reserved). Alternatives: Take for L1_27 (1B1G1Blk -> GREEN1, less valuable than BLACK2); reserve L2_46 secures 3pt but delays bonus/engine (cannot buy immediately next even after opp returns Blk1, short 1 Blk equiv: 3Blk+1G=4<5); pursuing L1_34 slow (short colors). Efficient: bonus acquisition next turn advances mid-game faster, tokens 7<=10 no return, board supplies ok (W2 B2 G3). Prevents stall, builds toward 15pt.

======================================================================================

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: We want to block opponent from acquiring the green bonus from L1_27, which would enable them to purchase L2_44 if they acquire gold tokens. Reserving L1_27 gives us a gold token and prevents opponent from taking it. After reserving, we will have 9 tokens (2W,2B,1G,0R,1Bk,3Gold). On the next turn we can take the remaining white token and purchase our reserved L2_61, giving us 2 prestige points and a green bonus. This plan maximises our progress towards 15 prestige while limiting opponent opportunities.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current position: 1pt, RED1 BLACK1 bonuses, tokens 1W1B1G2R2Blk (total 7). Reserved L1_34 (future RED2). Can buy L1_1 IMMEDIATELY: cost W1 B1 G1 R1, RED1 covers R1, pay exactly 1W1B1G1. Post-buy: gain BLACK2 (now RED1 BLACK2), left 2R 2Blk (4 tokens), score 1pt. Accelerates engine for high-value targets: L2_46 (Blk6->4), L3_74 (R7 Blk3->R6 Blk1 payable soon with 2R2Blk + takes), L3_73 (G3 R6 Blk3->G3 R5 Blk1), L3_71 (W3 B3 G5 R3->W3 B3 G5 R2), N10 (W3 R3 Blk3->W3 R2 Blk1). L1_1 threatened by opponent (they have W2 B2 G1 G3, can pay W1 B1 G1 +G for R1), but they prioritize reserved L1_20 (exact fit for WHITE2). Buying now denies opponent BLACK bonus, secures my engine ramp one turn early (better than planned take then buy). Cannot buy L1_34 (short 1W); L1_37 (B2 G1, have neither B/G after? No, but don't have B2 now); L1_7 G3 no; L1_28 no. No higher buys affordable. Taking tokens (e.g., 1W1B1G but board only 1W1B2G, would go to 10 tokens but no immediate buy better than this). Reserving L2_46 gets Gold but delays BLACK2 (critical for mid-game). Opponent low threat (0pt, 3 reserves, likely buys L1_20). Efficient: bonus now > tokens, positions for 15pt fast. Tokens 7<=10 no returns. Card L1_1 exists on board L1. No mistakes.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, BLK=1, GLD=3}
Reasoning: I buy the Level-1 card L1_19 because I have the required tokens (2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK) and a gold token to cover the missing GREEN. This card provides a second WHITE bonus, which will reduce the white cost of my reserved L2_61 and also blocks the opponent from obtaining that bonus. After this purchase I will have 2 white bonuses and 2 gold tokens, setting me up to reserve another card for an extra gold and then buy L2_61 for 2 prestige points.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current position: 1pt, RED1 BLACK2 bonuses, tokens 2R 2Blk (total 4), reserved L1_34 (future RED2). No immediate purchases possible (L1_34 needs W2 B1 G1 effective; board L1s lack required tokens like for L1_9 W1 G1 or L1_37 B2 G1). Cannot reach L2_46 Blk4 equiv immediately (2Blk, board Blk2 <4 for double-take). Opponent 0pt WHITE2, tokens 2W 2Gld (total 4), likely buys reserved L1_20 next (effective W1 B1 Blk1 payable with W1 + 2Gld, gains WHITE3, low pt threat; cannot easily buy high Blk/RED cards or L2_46). Optimal: RESERVE L2_46 (3pt BLACK bonus, visible on L2), receive 1 Gold (3 avail). Post-reserve: tokens 2R 2Blk 1Gld (5), secures key card matching engine. Next turn plan: take 1B 1G 1Blk (avail B4 G4 Blk2), post-take 1B 1G 2R 3Blk 1Gld (8<=10), buy reserved L2_46 paying 3Blk + 1Gld-as-Blk for Blk4 exactly, gain 3pt + BLACK3 bonus, left 1B 1G 2R (4 tokens), score 4pt. Accelerates to mid-game points/engine (unlocks L3_74 R6 Blk1 easier with BLACK3 RED1, L3_73 etc., N10). Superior to token takes (e.g., 1W1B1G toward L1_34 buys RED2 0pt in two turns, no points; 2B/2G no immediate buy). Reserving secures vs potential opponent interest (low but proactive), Gold enables exact buy. No better: reserve L3_74 harder ramp (R6), blind deck risky. Efficient points > bonuses now (turn 10, opponent 0pt). No mistakes: L2_46 exists on board L2, Gold avail, no tokens/returns.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: We currently have 4 tokens: 2 white and 2 gold. Our plan is to buy the L1_9 card next turn to acquire a blue bonus, which will reduce the cost of future blue‑heavy cards. To do this, we need 1 white, 1 green, 1 red, and 1 black token. We already have a white token, so we will take one green, one red, and one black token from the board. This keeps us well below the 10‑token limit and positions us for a bonus in the next turn.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {RED=3, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current position: 1pt, RED1 BLACK2 bonuses, tokens 2R 2Blk 1Gld (total 5), reserved L1_34 (future RED2 0pt), L2_46 (BLACK3 3pt). No purchases possible: L2_46 needs Blk4 equiv (Blk6-BLK2), have Blk2+Gld1=3<4; L1_34 needs W2 B1 G1 Blk1 (bonuses don't cover W/B/G); board L1_9 effective W1 G1 (R1-BLK1 covered by bonuses) but lack W/G; others worse (L1_37 B2 G1 no; L1_7 G3 no; L1_28 no; higher impossible). Executing plan: TAKE 1B 1G 1Blk (board B4 G3 Blk1 avail, valid 3 diff), post-take: B1 G1 2R 3Blk 1Gld (8<=10). Next turn: buy reserved L2_46 pay 3Blk +1Gld-as-Blk=4, gain 3pt + BLACK3, left B1 G1 2R (4 tokens), score 4pt. Positions B/G for L1_34 buy after (effective W2 B1 G1 post-RED2 BLACK3). Engine: BLACK3 RED1 unlocks L3_74 (R6 Blk0), L3_73 (G3 R5 Blk0), L3_71 (W3 B3 G5 R2), N10 (W3 R2 Blk0). Opponent 0pt WHITE2, tokens W2 G1 R1 Blk1 Gld2 (7), likely buys reserved L1_20 (effective W1 B1 Blk1 post-WHITE2, pay W1 Blk1 +Gld-as-B gain WHITE3 0pt) or board L1_9 (effective G1 R1 Blk1 pay exact, gain BLUE1 irrelevant); low threat, can't reach my targets/L2_46 (mine reserved). Alternatives worse: 2B (double ok) but no Blk take, next short for L2_46; 1W1B1G positions L1_34/L1_9 but skips Blk1 (only1, opp might take), delays 3pt; reserve unnecessary (L2_44/L3_74 riskier, decks unknown). Prioritize points/engine ramp turn 11 vs opp 0pt. No mistakes: supplies exact, total8<=10 no return, card_ids verified.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: We have 2 white bonuses and 2 gold tokens, giving us enough resources to buy our reserved L2_61, which costs 4 white, 2 blue, and 1 black. 2 white bonuses reduce the white cost to 2, and we use our 2 gold tokens to cover the missing 2 blue tokens. The purchase gives 2 prestige points and a green bonus, which is the highest immediate benefit. No other card on the board provides prestige points that we can afford this turn, and we already have 3 reserved cards so we cannot reserve more to block the opponent. Purchasing L2_61 is the optimal move.

Reasoning: Current position: 1pt, RED1 BLACK2 bonuses, tokens B1 G1 R2 Blk3 Gld1 (total 8), reserved L1_34 (RED bonus 0pt), L2_46 (BLACK bonus 3pt). Executing plan: PURCHASE L2_46 (reserved, cost Blk6 - BLACK2 = Blk4 equiv). Pay exactly 3Blk +1Gld-as-Blk. Post-buy: score 4pt, bonuses RED1 BLACK3, tokens B1 G1 R2 (total 4), reserved L1_34. Perfect ramp to mid-game engine/points. BLACK3 RED1 unlocks: L3_74 (R7 Blk3 -> R6 Blk0 payable with R2 + takes 2R? but R1 avail; or double R if >=4 later), L3_73 (G3 R6 Blk3 -> G3 R5 Blk0), L3_71 (W3 B3 G5 R3 -> W3 B3 G5 R2), N10 (W3 R3 Blk3 -> W3 R2 Blk0 perfect post-L1_34), L2_44 (G5 R3 -> G5 R2). Next: take toward L1_34 buy (need W2 for effective W2 B1 G1 pay exactly with current B1 G1 +2W), e.g., take 2W (board W4>=4 avail, valid double), post 2W B1 G1 R2 (6), buy L1_34 pay 2W B1 G1 (Blk1 covered BLACK3, RED bonus extra), gain RED2 bonus now RED2 BLACK3, left R2 (2 tokens), score4. Or take 1W1Blk1R if avail but Blk1 R1 low. Opponent score2 WHITE2 GREEN1, tokens G1 R1 (total2), reserved L1_20/L1_27 (can't buy: L1_20 eff W1 B1 Blk1 no tokens; L1_27 eff B1 R1 Blk2 (GREEN1 no help) have R1 no B/Blk). Board buys impossible for them (L1_9 eff G1 no R/Blk/W after bonuses? Their bonuses WHITE2 GREEN1 reduce W/G but L1_9 W1G1R1Blk1 -> W0? but no tokens anyway). Low threat, can't contest L3s or N10. No better actions: Can't buy board (L1_9 needs W1; L1_37 B2>1; no others). Taking tokens skips 3pt now (e.g., 2Blk invalid Blk1<4; 1W1B1R but delays points). Reserve unnecessary (L3_74/L2_44 riskier, L2_46 secured). Tokens post-buy 4<=10, no returns. Efficient: points + engine now vs opp2pt turn12. Card L2_46 verified reserved by me. No mistakes.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: We have two reserved cards already and we can reserve one more. By reserving L1_9 we acquire a gold token (useful for future purchases) and a blue bonus (which will reduce the cost of blue‑heavy Level‑2 cards). It also blocks the opponent from taking that card. We are not taking any tokens this turn, so no take or return fields are needed.

Reasoning: Current position: 4pt, RED1 BLACK3 bonuses, tokens B1 G1 R2 (total 4), reserved L1_34 (future RED2 0pt). No immediate board/reserved purchases: L1_34 effective W2 B1 G1 (BLACK1 covered by BLACK3), have B1 G1 short W2; board L1_37 B2 G1 short B1; L1_7 G3 short G2; L1_22 B2 (BLACK2 covered) short B1; higher impossible (e.g., L3_74 R6 short R4; L2_44 G5 R2 short G4). Opponent 2pt WHITE2 GREEN1, tokens G1 R1 GOLD1 (3), reserved L1_20/27/9; can buy L1_9 (effective R1 BLACK1 post-bonuses, pay R1 + GOLD-as-BLACK, gain BLUE1 0pt low threat); can't reach my targets/engine cards. Optimal: TAKE 2 WHITE (board WHITE4>=4, valid double), post-take W2 B1 G1 R2 (6<=10). Next turn: buy reserved L1_34 pay exactly W2 B1 G1, gain RED2 (now RED2 BLACK3), left R2 (2 tokens), score 4pt. Accelerates engine: unlocks N10 easier (W3 R3 BLACK3 -> W3 R1 BLACK0 post-RED2); L3_74 R6 BLACK0; L3_71 W3 B3 G5 R1; L2_44 G5 R2; L3_73 G3 R5 BLACK0. Superior to alternatives: 1W1RED1BLACK (RED1 BLACK4 avail) gets W1 R3 B1 G1 (7) but short W1 for L1_34, extra R/BLK not needed; reserve L3_74/L2_44 risks opponent taking tokens/GOLD meanwhile, delays RED2; blind reserve unnecessary. 2W exact for next buy, no returns needed. Efficient mid-game ramp to 15pt (target 7-10pt cards + nobles) vs opp low progress/points. Board supplies verified, total6<=10, card_ids not used.

We want to buy our reserved L1_9 next turn to gain a BLUE bonus and also collect a BLUE token for the subsequent L2_51 purchase. To do that we must take one WHITE, one BLACK, and one BLUE token now. This gives us the necessary WHITE and BLACK tokens to buy L1_9 on the next turn and a BLUE token that will be used later for L2_51. This action respects the token rules and keeps our total tokens below 10.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Reasoning: Current position: 4pt, RED1 BLACK3 bonuses, tokens W2 B1 G1 R2 (total 6), reserved L1_34 (RED2 0pt). Executing plan: PURCHASE L1_34 (reserved, effective cost W2 B1 G1 Blk1 - BLACK3 covers Blk1). Pay exactly W2 B1 G1. Post-buy: score 4pt, bonuses RED2 BLACK3, tokens R2 (total 2). Perfect engine upgrade. Unlocks: N10 (W3 R3 Blk3 -> W3 R1 Blk0 payable soon with R2 + take 3W/1W2Blk etc.); L3_74 (R7 Blk3 -> R5 Blk0); L3_73 (G3 R6 Blk3 -> G3 R4 Blk0); L3_71 (W3 B3 G5 R3 -> W3 B3 G5 R1); L2_44 (G5 R3 -> G5 R1). No board buys possible (L1_37 B2 G1 short B1; L1_22 B2 short B1 after BLACK3 covers Blk2; others worse). Higher/L3s short tokens. Opponent 2pt WHITE2 GREEN1, tokens W1 B1 G1 R1 Blk1 Gld1 (6), can buy reserved L1_20 (eff W1 B1 Blk1 pay exact, gain WHITE3 0pt) or L1_9 (eff R1 Blk1 pay R1 Blk1, BLUE1); low pt/threat, can't contest L3s/N10 (no RED/BLK engine). Alternatives worse: take tokens (e.g., 1W1R1Blk but W1 avail, goes to7, delays RED2); reserve L3_74/L2_44 risks opp token grabs, delays engine. Buy now > anything, positions 15pt fast (target L3s + N10). Tokens post-buy2<=10 no returns. Card L1_34 verified reserved by me, board supplies irrelevant. No mistakes.

Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any Level‑2 or Prestige card this turn because I lack the necessary tokens. My best next move is to acquire the reserved card L1_9 (BLUE bonus) on the next turn, and then a Level‑2 BLUE‑heavy card (L2_51) later. To do this I need 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token for L1_9, plus 1 BLUE token for L2_51. The board still has at least 1 of each of these colors (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, BLACK:3). Taking these three tokens keeps my total token count at 9 (below the 10‑token limit) and does not require returning any tokens. No purchase or reserve action is needed this turn, so I will simply take these three tokens.

Reasoning: Current position: 4pt, RED2 BLACK3 bonuses, tokens R2 (total 2), no reserved. No purchases possible: L3_74 eff R5 (R7-RED2 Blk3-BLK3=R5 Blk0) have R2<5; L3_73 G3 R4 Blk0 (G3 R6 Blk3 eff) R2<4 no G; L2_44 G5 R1 (R3-RED2) R2>1 but G0<5; L1_37 B2 G1 no B/G; L1_22 B2 (Blk2-BLK3= B2) no B; others worse/higher. No doubles possible (W2 B2 G3 R1 Blk2 all <4). Opponent 2pt WHITE2 GREEN1, tokens W2 B2 G1 R1 Blk2 Gld1 (9), reserved low-pt L1s (likely buys L1_20 eff W1 B1 Blk1 pay exact -> WHITE3 bonus, tokens ~6 post-buy; or L1_9 eff R1 Blk1; can't afford L3s/L2_44 without RED/BLK engine). Optimal: RESERVE L3_74 (visible L3 5pt BLACK bonus to BLACK4), get 1 Gold (4 avail). Post-reserve: tokens R2 Gold1 (3<=10). Secures highest pt card matching engine vs opp no threat. Next plan: reserve L3_73 (4pt BLACK Gold2), post R2 Gold2 (4). Opp turn (likely buy/reserve low, board R1 persists). Then take R1 Blk1 G1 (avail), post R3 Gold2 Blk1 G1 (7). Buy L3_74 pay R3 + 2Gold-as-R exactly (Blk0 covered), score 9pt BLACK4, left Blk1 G1 (2). Then target L3_73 (eff G3 R4 Blk0 pay G1 + takes + Gold if needed), L3_71/N10 (unlocks with BLACK4). Efficient ramp to 15+pt (9 +4 L3_73 +3 N10 +2s). Superior to TAKE (e.g., R1 Blk1 G1 -> R3 Blk1 G1 (5) no immediate buy, risks opp taking R1/Blk2 meanwhile without securing 5pt; 1W1B1G positions distant L3_71 but delays points).

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: We have 9 tokens and 3 reserved cards. We cannot reserve any more. The only purchase that gives a bonus useful for a soon‑to‑be‑buyable prestige card is L1_9, which yields a BLUE bonus and can be bought with our current tokens (no gold needed). This blue bonus reduces the cost of L2_51 from 5 to 4 blue tokens. We can then take 2 turns to collect the remaining two blue tokens and purchase L2_51 on turn 4, gaining 2 prestige points. No other card can be bought this turn that leads to a prestige card sooner. Thus the optimal action now is to buy L1_9.

Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: We cannot purchase any card with the current tokens (only 2 white, 1 black, no gold). The best immediate move is to reserve the Level‑2 card L2_52, which gives us a gold token for future use and blocks the opponent from acquiring a 3‑prestige card. We have 2 reserved cards already, so we are allowed one more.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_52, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=2, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Given the current token pool and bonuses, the only Level‑2 card we can afford immediately is L2_51, which costs {BLUE:5}. With our blue bonus (1) the effective cost is 4, and we have 2 blue tokens and 2 gold tokens to cover it. Buying L2_51 yields 2 prestige points and a blue bonus, which is the most efficient use of our available resources and will help us reduce future costs. No other card offers a comparable benefit under the present constraints. Therefore the optimal next move is to purchase L2_51.

Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: We currently have no ability to purchase a prestige card or a level‑2 card that gives points. The fastest path to gain prestige is to acquire the level‑2 card L2_67 on the next turn, which costs 5 blue tokens but with our 2‑blue bonus reduces to 2 blue tokens. The board has 4 blue tokens available, so we will take 2 blue tokens now. This does not exceed the 10‑token limit and no gold token is earned because we cannot reserve any card (we are at the maximum of 3 reserved cards). Taking 2 blue tokens sets us up to buy L2_67 next turn, earning 2 prestige points and a red bonus, moving us closer to the 15‑point goal while keeping us ahead of the opponent.

Next: opp buy low, board post-take G1 R3 Blk1 persist; then TAKE RED1 GREEN1 BLACK1 (likely avail), post G3 R2 Blk3 (8); opp; then TAKE RED1 GREEN1 WHITE1 or RED2 double (if R3-?>=4 unlikely but R ramp +W for N10), to G3+ R3+ Blk3+ W? (10ish); then PURCHASE L3_73 pay G3 R4 exact (Blk0), score13pt BLACK5 RED2, left extras. Then target N10 (eff W3 R1 Blk0 pay W3 R1 takes); L2_44 G5 R1 etc. Ramp to 16+pt fast (13+3=16). Superior to double RED2 (R faster but G1 stuck risks opp take G1/2 depleting before ramp); take W/R/Blk for N10 first (3pt noble <4pt card, delays engine BLACK5); reserve/blind unnecessary (L3_73 secured, risks low pt/opp grabs tokens). Efficient vs opp stalled ~4-7pt. No mistakes.

Reasoning: We discuss further..
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn={GREEN=1, BLACK=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: We are player 1 with 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 1 BLACK, 0 GOLD tokens and bonuses WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1. We also already own two prestige cards (2 + 2 = 4 points). Our 3 reserved cards are full, so we cannot reserve anymore. Checking the board, the only purchases we can afford use our bonuses: – L1_37 (cost BLUE 2, GREEN 1) can be paid with 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens, giving a RED bonus but no prestige; – L2_67 (cost WHITE 1, BLUE 4, GREEN 2) after applying bonuses requires just 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN token, giving a RED bonus and +2 prestige. All other cards exceed our token/bonus limits. Since our goal is to reach 15 prestige points as quickly as possible, the action that maximizes immediate prestige is to purchase L2_67. We have exactly the needed 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens, and no gold is required. Thus we perform a PURCHASE_CARD of L2_67, reducing our tokens to 2 WHITE, 1 BLACK, and adding a RED bonus and 2 additional prestige points. This keeps our token count within the limit and moves us closer to 15 points with the most efficient use of resources.

Reasoning: The only card we can afford right now without using any tokens is L1_37. Bonuses cover its WHITE and GREEN costs, so we can buy it for free and it provides a RED gem bonus. No other card on the board is buyable, and we cannot reserve further. Therefore we should purchase L1_37.

Reasoning: We have 2 white, 0 blue, 0 green, 0 red, 1 black tokens and cannot purchase any card. Taking 2 blue tokens is allowed (board has 4+ blue tokens). This keeps total tokens at 5, below the 10‑token limit, and provides a blue token needed for future purchases such as L2_66 (red gem) or L1_28 (green gem). No immediate purchase is possible, so token acquisition is optimal.

No purchases possible except L1_7 GREEN3 exact (0pt BLACK5 bonus, pay G3 left G1 R3 Blk3 total7), but 0pt delays engine upgrade. Other board cards unaffordable: L2_44 G5 R1 (G4<5); L3_71 W3 B3 G5 R1 no W/B/G5>4; L2_66 B3 no B; etc. No nobles (N10 requires 3 WHITE-bonus cards owned: have 0; BLACK4>3 RED2<3).

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: We have 6 prestige points and 6 tokens. No Level‑2 or Level‑3 prestige cards are affordable this turn. We can buy a Level‑1 card for free: L1_39 (cost 3 white but our 2‑white bonus covers it). Buying it gives a red bonus (+1), improving our future cost for any red‑cost card. It costs no tokens, preserves our token pool, and is the most efficient use of the turn.

Reasoning: Current position: 9pt, RED2 BLACK4 bonuses, tokens GREEN3 RED3 BLACK3 GOLD1 (total 10), reserved L3_73 (4pt BLACK to BLACK5), L2_44 (2pt BLACK to BLACK6). Effective cost L3_73: GREEN3 RED6 BLACK3 - RED2 BLACK4 = GREEN3 RED4 BLACK0. Have exact: pay GREEN3 RED3 + GOLD1-as-RED. Board supplies irrelevant for purchase. Verified L3_73 reserved by me. Post-buy: score 13pt, bonuses RED2 BLACK5, tokens BLACK3 (total 3). Perfect progression as planned. Secures 4pt engine upgrade. Next: target L2_44 (reserved, eff GREEN5 RED3 -RED2 BLACK5 = GREEN5 RED1 BLACK0, pay via takes GREEN2+board1?

No nobles yet (N10 need 3W cards owned=0; N1 B4 W4 no; N2 G4 R4 have G0 R3 no G/R cards). Can't take (10/10 waste return); reserve unnecessary (L2_44/L3_73 secured). Opponent 6pt WHITE2 BLUE2 GREEN1 RED3, tokens W1 B2 BLACK1 (4), reserved low-pt L1_20/27 L2_52; likely PURCHASE L1_20 (eff W1 BLACK1 pay exact W1 BLACK1 -> WHITE3 0pt low threat, post W0 B2 total2); then maybe L1_27 etc. low pt; can't contest (L3_73 eff for them G2 R4 BLACK3 huge shortfall no G/R/Blk; L2_44 G5 R1 have G0 R0<; N10 W2<3 R3=3 BLACK0<3 no BLACK cards).

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: We have 1 white, 2 blue, 1 black, 0 green, 0 red tokens. Purchasing any face‑up card is impossible with these tokens and our current bonuses. The only purchase we can make now is the reserved L1_20, which gives no prestige and would leave us with only one token.  A more efficient path is to gather the green tokens needed to buy the high‑prestige level‑2 card L2_47 on the next turn. The board has 4 green tokens available, so we can safely take two green tokens. This move keeps our token count at 6 (within the 10‑token limit), gives us a blue bonus after buying L2_47, and sets up the sequence to acquire L2_58 (3 prestige) and L3_78 (5 prestige) within six turns, which is faster than any alternative involving a current purchase of L1_20 or other token combinations. Thus we take two green tokens now.

Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: We have 3 white, 3 black, 3 red gem bonuses and only need one more white gem to meet the requirement for noble N10 (3 white, 3 black, 3 red). Purchasing the reserved card L1_20 costs 1 white token and 1 black token (after bonuses), which we have. This purchase gives a white gem bonus, completing the noble requirement and awarding +3 prestige immediately. No other card offers more prestige in this turn; all other affordable cards give 0 prestige or only 1 prestige. Thus buying L1_20 maximizes short‑term prestige gain and sets us on a path toward 15 points. No tokens will exceed the 10‑token limit.

Reasoning: We currently have 6 prestige points and 4 tokens (0 white, 2 blue, 2 green, 0 red, 0 black). Our bonuses are white 3, blue 2, green 1, red 3. We can purchase the Level‑2 card L2_47 for 1 green token: cost after bonuses is BLUE 0, GREEN 1, RED 0. This purchase gives +1 prestige and adds a blue gem (+1 to blue bonus). It consumes 1 green token, leaving us with 3 tokens (0 white, 2 blue, 1 green). This action provides immediate progress towards the 15‑point goal and uses a token we already have without needing to return any tokens. No other affordable card offers more prestige at this turn, and buying L2_47 keeps our token count well below the 10‑token limit.

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=3}
Reasoning: We currently have no tokens but hold several gem bonuses: 3 white, 3 blue, 1 green, 3 red, and 5 black. Among the face‑up cards, only L2_66 can be bought using the gems we already possess (cost 3 blue, 2 red, 3 black) and it grants +1 prestige plus a red gem. After this purchase we will still satisfy the noble requirement for N10 (3 white, 3 black, 3 red) and will automatically claim it for an additional +3 prestige. This results in a total of +4 prestige this turn, raising our score from 7 to 11, and is the most efficient move available. No other card can be bought with our current gems that would yield more prestige, and we cannot take tokens or reserve a card in the same turn.

Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_66]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_66
Reasoning: We currently have 13 prestige points and tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 3, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 0, GOLD 0. We have bonuses: WHITE 4, BLUE 3, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 6. The only remaining face‑up card that can be purchased for free (cost 0 after bonuses) is L2_66 (cost BLUE 3, RED 2, BLACK 3). With our bonuses (BLUE 3, RED 3, BLACK 6) the cost is reduced to 0 tokens. Purchasing this card adds 1 prestige and a RED bonus. This action gives us a total of 14 prestige points, moves us closer to the target, and keeps our token count unchanged. No tokens are taken or returned.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_66]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_66
Reasoning: The only card that can be purchased immediately with our current bonuses and token supply is L1_28.  After applying bonuses (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, RED:3, GREEN:1), the cost of L1_28 (WHITE1, BLUE3, GREEN1) is reduced to 0, requiring no tokens.  This purchase provides a GREEN bonus and does not exceed the 10‑token limit.  No token take/return is necessary.

Turn 27 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=3}
Reasoning: We currently have 7 prestige and a token pool of 0 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN. The only immediately purchasable card is L1_7, which costs our sole GREEN token and grants a BLACK gem. While useful, it would deplete the GREEN token we would otherwise use to buy the high‑value L2_58 (needs 2 WHITE tokens after bonuses). The optimal short‑term strategy is to acquire the 2 WHITE tokens required for that purchase, setting us up for a 3‑prestige card on the next turn. Thus we take 2 WHITE tokens now.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
