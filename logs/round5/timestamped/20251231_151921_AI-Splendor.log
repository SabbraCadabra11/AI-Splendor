2025-12-31 15:19:43.814 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is the first turn of the game with no cards or tokens purchased. I need to establish a token base to buy affordable cards in the next few turns.

Analyzing the Level 1 cards:
- L1_37 (Red bonus) costs Blue(2) + Green(1).
- L1_5 (Black bonus) costs Green(2) + Red(1).

These two cards are the most accessible point-generators (bonus gems) on the board. To efficiently acquire either of these in the next turn or two, I should focus on gathering the colors involved in their costs: Green, Blue, and Red.

Taking 3 different tokens (Blue, Green, Red) provides maximum flexibility:
1. With Green and Blue, I can buy L1_37 immediately if a card I don't need isn't there (or next turn).
2. With Green and Red, I can buy L1_5.
3. Red is also a key color for several Level 2 cards visible (L2_56, L2_57, L2_70) and Nobles (N5, N2).

Therefore, I will take one Blue, one Green, and one Red token.

2025-12-31 15:20:35.027 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: It is my first turn as player 1, and I have no tokens. I cannot purchase any card yet due to lack of tokens. I have two main options: take tokens or reserve a card. The opponent (player 0) has 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED token, putting them close to purchasing low-cost level 1 cards like L1_37 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:1) or L1_5 (cost GREEN:2, RED:1). By reserving L1_37, I deny the opponent this card and gain a gold token, which can be used as a wild card when purchasing cards later. Reserving early secures a card for future purchase and provides flexibility. L1_37 has a low cost and gives a RED bonus, which may be useful for future cards or nobles. After reserving, on my next turn, I can take tokens to gather the necessary resources to purchase L1_37, leveraging the gold token to reduce the required tokens.

2025-12-31 15:21:33.197 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red token. I need to acquire a development card to start building my engine and prestige points. Looking at the Level 1 cards:
- **L1_5** (Black bonus, 0 pts) costs Green(2) + Red(1). I have G(1) and R(1), so I need exactly 1 more Green to afford this.
- **L1_29** (Green bonus, 0 pts) costs White(2) + Blue(1). I have B(1), so I need 2 more White. 
- **L1_16** (Blue bonus, 1 pt) costs Red(4). This is too expensive to target quickly.

Acquiring L1_5 (Black bonus) is a strong start because:
1. It provides a Black bonus, which is useful for Noble N5 (Black/Red) and Noble N3 (White/Black).
2. The opponent reserved L1_37 (Red bonus), suggesting they are interested in Red. Focusing on Black/White allows me to pivot away from direct competition on Red bonuses initially.

To purchase L1_5 next turn, I need 1 Green token. I should also take tokens that diversify my pool for future purchases. Taking White and Black will help me afford Level 2 cards or aim for Noble N3 later.

Therefore, I will take 1 Green, 1 White, and 1 Black token. This brings my counts to Blue(1), Green(2), Red(1), White(1), Black(1), allowing me to buy L1_5 immediately on my next turn.

2025-12-31 15:22:11.735 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am player 1, and it is my second turn. I have reserved L1_37 and have 1 gold token. To purchase L1_37 (cost: 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN), I need at least 1 BLUE and 1 GREEN token in my inventory, as I can use the gold token to substitute for one BLUE cost. Taking 1 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens this turn would not be sufficient alone since I must take exactly 3 tokens or 2 of the same color. However, taking 2 of the same color is not possible because no token color has 4+ available (BLUE has 3, GREEN has 2, etc.). Therefore, I must take exactly 3 different color tokens. I will take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED. After this, I will have 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 GOLD, which allows me to purchase L1_37 on my next turn by using the BLUE token and gold token for the BLUE costs and the GREEN token for the GREEN cost. The RED token may be useful for future cards or nobles. My current token count is 1 (gold), and after taking 3 tokens, I have 4 total, which is under 10, so no tokens need to be returned. The opponent may purchase L1_5 this turn since they have the exact tokens required (2 GREEN and 1 RED), but that only gives 0 points and a BLACK bonus, which is acceptable early game.

I can purchase L1_37 now because the cost is 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN, and I can use my BLUE token, GREEN token, and GOLD token (as a substitute for one BLUE) to cover it. Purchasing this card gives me a RED bonus, which aligns with my engine-building strategy, and it clears my tokens efficiently without needing to return any. This action prevents the opponent from potentially accessing this card later and sets me up to take tokens on my next turn for further development. Other actions like reserving or taking tokens are less optimal since I can immediately gain a bonus and progress towards points.

There are no Level 1 cards I can afford with this exact combination. To set up a purchase for the next turn, I need to gather tokens that align with an affordable card. Card L1_29 (Green bonus) costs 2 White and 1 Blue. I already have 1 White and 1 Blue, so I need exactly 1 more White token to purchase it. Taking 1 White, 1 Green, and 1 Red token diversifies my pool: the White completes the requirement for L1_29, the Red token helps towards Nobles N2 and N5, and the Green token adds liquidity. This move leaves me with 6 tokens, allowing me to buy L1_29 immediately on my next turn and still retain tokens for future plays.

I also have the option to purchase L1_9 (Blue bonus, 0 pts) for 1 White, 1 Green, 1 Red, and 1 Black. Comparing the two, L1_29 is the superior strategic choice because it provides a Green bonus, which is required for Noble N2 (Red/Green), whereas the Blue bonus from L1_9 does not align with any of the available Nobles. Additionally, purchasing L1_29 leaves me with Green, Red, and Black tokens, which aligns well with the Noble requirements (N3 needs White/Black, N5 needs Black/Red), and frees up token space. I will purchase L1_29 to secure my second bonus and progress towards a Noble.

I currently have tokens: RED:1 and GOLD:1, and I have reserved L1_16, which costs RED:4 but with my RED bonus from L1_37, the cost is effectively RED:3. To purchase L1_16 on my next turn, I need more RED tokens or to use gold tokens. By taking one RED token now, I will have RED:2 and GOLD:1, which allows me to cover the RED:3 cost using two RED tokens and one gold token. Additionally, taking WHITE and GREEN tokens provides resources for other level 1 cards like L1_2 or L1_9, which may be useful for engine building or point scoring in future turns. The opponent cannot reserve or purchase L1_16 since it is already in my reserved cards, so securing tokens for its purchase is safe. This action avoids returning tokens as my total will be 5 tokens after taking, which is under the limit of 10.

2025-12-31 15:29:42.724 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 3 tokens (Green, Red, Black) and 2 bonuses (Green, Black). There are no cards I can afford immediately with this combination. 

Looking at the board:
- L1_1 (Black bonus) costs 1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red. With my current pool + bonuses, I lack White and Blue tokens.
- L1_2 (Black bonus) costs 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red. Also lacks White and Blue.
- L1_9 (Blue bonus) is affordable (0 cost with bonuses), but provides a Blue bonus which doesn't help with Nobles N2 (Red/Green), N3 (White/Black), or N5 (Black/Red).
- L1_28 (Green bonus) costs 1 White, 3 Blue, 1 Green.

I need to acquire White and Blue tokens to enable future purchases. Taking White, Blue, and Red tokens is the best move:
1. White is scarce (3 left) and needed for L1_1/L1_2 and Noble N3.
2. Blue is needed for L1_1/L1_2 and Level 2 cards.
3. Red helps for Noble N5 and Noble N2.

This brings my total to 6 tokens, well under the limit of 10, and sets me up to potentially purchase a card next turn.

I can use my two RED tokens and one GOLD token to cover the RED:3 cost, as gold can substitute for any color. Purchasing L1_16 gives me 1 prestige point and a BLUE bonus, which helps progress my score and engine. Other actions, such as taking tokens or reserving another card, are less optimal because I can immediately score a point and secure the card, whereas taking tokens would delay scoring and might not directly lead to a point soon. The board state shows no immediate opportunities to purchase other cards with my current tokens, and reserving another card would not yield points as efficiently.

2025-12-31 15:30:58.235 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently hold 6 tokens and have bonuses in Green and Black. I can afford two Level 1 cards: L1_9 (Blue bonus) and L1_1 (Black bonus). 

1. **L1_9 (Blue bonus)** costs 1 White and 1 Red. While it preserves more tokens, the Blue bonus does not align with the available Nobles (N2: Red/Green, N3: White/Black, N5: Black/Red).

2. **L1_1 (Black bonus)** costs 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Red. Acquiring this card gives me a second Black bonus. This is strategically superior because:
   - It directly progresses me towards Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black) and Noble N5 (4 Black/4 Red), requiring only 2 more Black bonuses for each.
   - It strengthens my purchasing power for high-level Black cards.
   - It prevents the opponent from easily contesting the Black-heavy Noble path.

Buying L1_1 reduces my token count from 6 to 3, keeping me well under the 10-token limit and securing a crucial engine component.

I can use gold tokens to substitute for missing BLUE costs, and this action denies the opponent access to a point card. Taking tokens this turn would only allow me to purchase non-point cards like L1_2 or L1_28, which are less efficient for scoring points compared to securing L1_8.

I lack a White bonus, which is critical for Noble N3. I notice card L1_22 (White bonus) costs 2 Blue and 2 Black. With my 2 Black bonuses, I only need 2 Blue tokens to purchase it next turn. Taking 2 Blue tokens and 1 White token is the optimal move: it sets up the purchase of L1_22 to acquire the White bonus, secures a White token for Noble requirements, and keeps my token count at a healthy 6.

Looking at the Level 1 cards, I cannot afford any immediately. However, L1_22 (White bonus, 0 pts) costs 2 Blue and 2 Black.

Taking 2 Blue and 1 White tokens is the optimal move: 1) The Blue tokens allow me to buy L1_22 next turn, providing a White bonus for Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black). 2) The White token is scarce (3 left) and needed for L1_22 and Nobles. 3) This brings me to 6 tokens total, well under the 10 limit, and gives me purchasing power for next turn.

2025-12-31 15:36:40.284 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I need to acquire a White bonus to pursue Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black). The only affordable White card on the board is L1_22, which costs 2 Blue and 2 Black. Since I already have 2 Black bonuses, the effective cost is just 2 Blue tokens. I currently have 0 Blue tokens. Taking 2 Blue tokens (allowed as there are 4 available) puts me at 5 tokens total (1 Green, 1 Red, 1 Black, 2 Blue). This sets up an immediate purchase of L1_22 on my next turn to secure the White bonus. This is more efficient than taking 3 different colors, which would likely result in buying a non-Noble card (like L1_9) and delaying the White bonus by at least one turn.

2025-12-31 15:39:42.402 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I need to purchase the reserved L1_8 card, which gives 1 prestige point and a black bonus, but I currently lack enough blue tokens. With my existing blue bonus from L1_16, the cost of L1_8 is reduced to 3 blue tokens. I have no blue tokens, but I have a gold token that can substitute for one blue. To cover the cost, I need at least 2 blue tokens (2 blue tokens + 1 gold token). Currently, I have only 1 gold token and no blue tokens. Taking tokens now allows me to acquire a blue token and other resources for future purchases. By taking one blue, one red, and one black token (three different colors, as no color has at least 4 available to take two of the same color), I add these to my existing tokens (white:1, green:1, gold:1), resulting in a total of 6 tokens, which is under the limit of 10. This sets me up to take another blue token on my next turn, after which I can purchase L1_8 on the following turn. Purchasing L1_2 or L1_9 now would use all my tokens and give no points, delaying my point acquisition. Reserving another card does not provide immediate points and may not accelerate L1_8 purchase. Thus, taking tokens is the optimal move to secure points soon.

Purchasing L1_9 uses my tokens efficiently without requiring additional token-taking, and it improves my engine for future card purchases. While L1_9 has no prestige points, it accelerates my path to scoring points with L1_8. Other actions, such as taking tokens or reserving cards, would not provide immediate benefits and might delay my point acquisition.

2025-12-31 15:42:58.873 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary strategic goal is to pursue Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black) and eventually high-value Black cards like L3_80 (4 pts for 7 Black). I currently have bonuses of White (1), Green (1), and Black (2). To advance the Black count, I can purchase card L1_2 (Black bonus) which costs 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. My current token pool is Green (1), Red (1), Black (1). By taking 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Red token, I will have the exact tokens needed (1W, 1B, 1G, 1R) to pay the non-Black costs of L1_2 on my next turn, using my 2 Black bonuses to cover the rest. This move also secures the scarce Red tokens (only 2 available on the board), preventing my opponent from blocking me. Taking these three colors keeps my token count at 6 (well under 10) and efficiently sets up an immediate card purchase next turn.

L1_8 costs BLUE:4, but with my BLUE:2 bonuses from L1_16 and L1_9, the cost is reduced to BLUE:2. I have BLUE:1 token and GOLD:1 token, which can substitute for the missing BLUE token. Purchasing this card gives me 1 prestige point, increasing my score to 2, and a BLACK bonus, which may help with future card purchases or nobles. This action is optimal as it directly scores points and uses my existing resources efficiently, whereas taking tokens or reserving another card would delay point acquisition without immediate benefit.

2025-12-31 15:43:44.178 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I can now purchase card L1_2 (Black bonus) which costs 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. My current token pool is exactly what I need: White (1), Blue (1), Green (1), Red (2), Black (1). I have enough to pay the full cost. Purchasing this card gives me a third Black bonus, bringing my total to Black (3), White (1), and Green (1). This puts me very close to Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black) - I now have 3 Black and only need 1 more White bonus. It also makes me highly competitive for Noble N5 (4 Black/4 Red) with 3 Black bonuses. After this purchase, I'll have 2 tokens remaining (1 Red, 1 Black), keeping me well under the limit of 10 and maintaining flexibility for future turns.

2025-12-31 15:44:07.951 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I need to correct my previous error. My token pool is White: 1, Blue: 1, Green: 1, Red: 2, Black: 1 (Total: 6). I previously tried to purchase L1_2 but was short 1 Blue token (it costs 2 Blue, I only had 1). Looking at the board:

1. L1_2 (Black bonus) costs 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red. To afford this, I need 1 more Blue token.
2. L1_20 (White bonus) costs 3 White, 1 Blue, 1 Black. With my 1 White bonus, I need 2 more White and 1 Blue.
3. L1_28 (Green bonus) costs 1 White, 3 Blue, 1 Green. With my 1 Green bonus, I need 1 White and 3 Blue.

The most efficient path is to take 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green token. This will give me:
- White: 2 (can buy L1_2 or L1_28 next turn)
- Blue: 2 (can buy L1_2 next turn)
- Green: 2 (helps with Noble N2: Red/Green)

After taking these, I'll have exactly the tokens to purchase L1_2 (Black bonus) on my next turn: 1 White + 1 bonus, 2 Blue, 1 Green + 1 bonus, 1 Red. This advances me toward Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black) and my goal of accumulating Black bonuses.

2025-12-31 15:45:04.783 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens except one RED token. I cannot purchase any card immediately because all available cards require tokens I don't have, even with my bonuses. Reserving a point card like L2_57 (2 points, WHITE bonus, cost RED:5) secures a valuable card for future purchase and grants me a gold token, which can be used as a wildcard. This action also denies the opponent access to a point card they might pursue. Taking tokens would only allow me to purchase low-value cards with no points, which delays scoring and is less efficient for reaching 15 points quickly. Thus, reserving L2_57 is the optimal move to efficiently progress while blocking the opponent.

2025-12-31 15:45:18.318 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently hold 9 tokens and have the bonuses (White: 1, Green: 1, Black: 2) to immediately purchase card L1_2 (Black bonus). The cost is 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. 

- White: Cost 1 - 1 Bonus = 0 tokens needed.
- Green: Cost 1 - 1 Bonus = 0 tokens needed.
- Blue: Cost 2 - 0 Bonus = 2 tokens needed (I have 2).
- Red: Cost 1 - 0 Bonus = 1 token needed (I have 2).

Purchasing this card is optimal because:
1. It secures a 3rd Black bonus, significantly accelerating progress towards Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black) and the high-value L3_80 (4 pts for 7 Black).
2. It burns 3 tokens (2 Blue, 1 Red), reducing my total from 9 to 6, keeping me well under the 10-token limit and avoiding the need to return tokens on a future turn.
3. It is more efficient than taking tokens, as I can make immediate progress on my engine strategy.

Taking three different tokens including RED will increase my token count and set me up to purchase L1_31 on the next turn if needed, or continue accumulating tokens for L2_57. I choose to take RED, BLACK, and GREEN tokens because BLACK may be useful for other point cards like L2_56, and GREEN may help with future purchases or nobles. This action efficiently builds my resources without exceeding token limits.

I can immediately purchase L2_42 (Black bonus, 1 point) which costs 3 White, 3 Green, and 2 Black. My bonuses reduce this cost to just 2 White and 2 Green tokens. I hold exactly 2 White and 2 Green tokens. Purchasing this card is optimal because: 1) It scores my first prestige point. 2) It grants my 4th Black bonus, significantly reducing the cost of high-value Level 3 cards like L3_80 (cost drops from 7 to 3 tokens) and L3_71. 3) It reduces my token count from 6 to 2, maximizing flexibility to take fresh tokens next turn to pursue these high-value cards or the remaining Noble requirements. Taking tokens now would delay scoring and engine efficiency.

I also take one GREEN and one BLACK token to increase my bonuses for potential nobles (N2 requires RED:4 and GREEN:4, N5 requires BLACK:4 and RED:4) or other future purchases. Taking three tokens this turn does not exceed my token limit (current 5 tokens + 3 = 8 tokens), and this action efficiently sets me up to score points soon without wasting resources on low-value cards.

2025-12-31 15:54:17.102 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary goal is to acquire the high-value Level 3 card L3_80 (4 points, White bonus), which costs 7 Black. With my 4 Black bonuses, the cost reduces to 3 Black tokens. I currently hold 1 Black token and the board has 1 available. I cannot take 2 Black (supply is only 1), so I will take the 1 available Black, bringing my total to 2. To maintain flexibility and progress towards Noble N3 (4 White/4 Black) or the fallback card L1_20 (White bonus, cost 2 White/1 Blue), I will also take 1 White and 1 Blue token. This gives me a versatile hand (2 Black, 1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Red) that allows me to either buy L3_80 next turn if a Black token replenishes, or buy L1_20 to advance my White count. Taking these tokens keeps my total at 5, well under the 10 limit.

Purchasing L2_57 will increase my score to 4 and give me a WHITE bonus, improving my engine for future cards. No other face-up cards are affordable immediately: L1_31 requires no points and would not advance my score efficiently, and other point cards require tokens I lack (e.g., WHITE for L1_20 and L1_10, RED for L2_56 and L2_70). Purchasing L2_57 now maximizes point gain and uses my tokens efficiently without exceeding token limits. The opponent (player 0) has a low score of 1 and no immediate noble threats, so focusing on my own point acquisition is optimal.

2025-12-31 15:57:14.417 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am currently behind in prestige points (1 vs 4) and need to make progress towards my available Nobles while scoring points. I have 4 Black bonuses, which allows me to ignore Black costs on many cards. I have identified two potential purchases for next turn: L1_20 (White bonus, 0 pts) and L2_65 (Red bonus, 1 pt). 

- L2_65 costs 2 White, 2 Red, and 3 Black. With my 4 Black bonuses, the effective cost is 2 White and 2 Red tokens. I currently hold 1 White and 1 Red. If I take 1 White and 1 Red, I will have exactly 2 of each, allowing me to purchase L2_65 immediately on my next turn for 1 prestige point.
- L1_20 costs 2 White and 1 Blue (after bonuses). Taking 1 White and 1 Blue would also set this up.

Since scoring points is a priority to catch up, setting up the purchase of L2_65 (1 point) is superior to L1_20 (0 points). To complete my turn, I need to take a third distinct token color. I choose Blue because I have 0 Blue bonuses and it offers flexibility for other cards. Taking White, Red, and Blue keeps my total tokens at 8 (well under 10) and sets up a guaranteed point next turn.

2025-12-31 15:59:39.803 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am trailing in prestige (1 vs 4) and need to score points immediately. I have identified L2_50 as a purchasable card that grants 2 prestige points. The card costs 2 White, 1 Red, and 4 Black. My current bonuses (1 White, 4 Black) reduce the cost to just 1 White and 1 Red token. I currently hold 2 White and 2 Red tokens, so I can afford this purchase. Buying this card achieves three critical goals: 1) It increases my score to 3, closing the gap with my opponent. 2) It reduces my token count from 8 to 6, keeping me safely under the 10-token limit and freeing up space to take tokens next turn. 3) It grants a Blue bonus, improving my discount diversity for future purchases (e.g., Level 3 Blue cards). This is the most efficient move available.

I cannot purchase any face-up card immediately due to insufficient tokens, and I cannot purchase my reserved card L2_65 because I lack WHITE and RED tokens. By taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED tokens, I increase my token count to 8, setting up to purchase L2_43 on my next turn. L2_43 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2, but after my bonuses (BLUE:2, RED:1), the cost reduces to GREEN:4 and RED:1. With my current tokens after taking (BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1), I can pay 3 GREEN and 1 GOLD for the GREEN cost (using gold as a substitute for the fourth GREEN) and 1 RED for the RED cost. This purchase gives 2 points and a BLACK bonus, efficiently advancing my score and supporting noble requirements. Taking tokens this way avoids returning tokens and prioritizes point acquisition over reserving or low-value purchases.

My primary target is the high-value Level 3 card L3_80 (4 points), which effectively costs 3 Black tokens with my bonuses. However, the board has 0 Black tokens available. To stimulate the Black token economy, I should aim to purchase a card that costs Black on my next turn, which will return Black tokens to the bank. L1_20 (White bonus, 0 pts) costs 3 White, 1 Blue, 1 Black. With my bonuses, this costs 2 White tokens. I currently hold 1 White token. By taking 1 White, I will be able to purchase L1_20 next turn, securing the White bonus (progress towards Noble N3 and synergy with L3_80) and returning a Black token to the bank. To maintain token flexibility and work towards other Nobles (N2: Red/Green, N5: Red/Black), I will also take 1 Red and 1 Green token. This brings my total token count to 9, which is safely under the limit.

This action gives me 2 prestige points, increasing my score to 6, and provides a BLACK bonus, which aligns with my strategy to build towards nobles and future cards. Purchasing L2_43 is more efficient than buying my reserved card L2_65 (1 point), as it maximizes point gain in a single turn. Additionally, it denies the opponent access to a valuable point card. After purchase, I will have 3 tokens remaining, so no token return is needed.

This action efficiently sets me up for point acquisition and denies the opponent the last available BLUE token, potentially slowing their engine.

2025-12-31 16:07:47.107 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am trailing 3 to 6 in prestige points and need to close the gap efficiently. My primary target is the Level 3 card L3_80 (4 points), which effectively costs 3 Black tokens given my 4 Black bonuses. However, the board currently has 0 Black tokens available. To unlock this card, I need to stimulate the Black token economy by returning Black tokens to the bank. I can achieve this by purchasing L1_13, which has a cost of 1 White and 2 Black. My bonuses (2 White, 4 Black) cover this entire cost, meaning I pay 0 tokens. This purchase returns 1 White and 2 Black tokens to the bank, immediately making Black tokens available. Next turn, I can take 1 Black token to have the 3 required for L3_80, positioning myself to purchase it and significantly boost my score.

Purchasing L2_65 gives me 1 prestige point, increasing my score to 7, and uses 3 tokens, leaving me with 2 BLUE and 1 BLACK token. No other face-up cards are affordable without taking additional tokens, and reserving another card would delay point acquisition. This action efficiently gains a point and clears my reserved slot for future opportunities.

2025-12-31 16:11:01.466 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am trailing 3 to 7 and need an efficient path to points. I have identified a strong combo: purchasing L3_80 (4 points, White bonus) to trigger Noble N3 (3 points). To trigger Noble N3, I need 4 White and 4 Black bonuses. I currently have 4 Black and 2 White bonuses. L1_17 provides a White bonus, bringing my count to 3 and one step away from the Noble. The cost of L1_17 (1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red, 1 Black) is fully covered by my existing bonuses (2 Blue, 1 Green, 2 Red, 4 Black), so the purchase costs 0 tokens. This move is critical for three reasons: 1) It secures the White bonus card before my opponent can potentially block me. 2) It returns 1 Black token to the bank (increasing supply from 1 to 2), which I desperately need to save up for L3_80. 3) It keeps my token count at 7, allowing me to take tokens next turn to afford L3_80 immediately afterwards.

2025-12-31 16:14:29.797 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 7 points and 3 tokens (2 BLUE, 1 BLACK). I need to reach 15 points, so I need 8 more points. I cannot purchase any face-up card immediately due to insufficient tokens. The most efficient path is to purchase L2_56, which gives 2 points and a WHITE bonus. L2_56 requires 3 RED and 1 BLACK after bonuses. I have 1 BLACK token, so I need 3 RED tokens. Since I can only take 1 RED token per turn (as RED has only 3 available, so I cannot take 2 RED in one action), it would take three turns to collect three RED tokens. However, by taking two gold tokens this turn, I can use gold tokens to substitute for RED tokens. If I take two gold now, I will have 2 gold tokens. Next turn, I can take one RED token, and then I can purchase L2_56 using 1 RED token and 2 gold tokens for the RED cost, and 1 BLACK token for the BLACK cost. This allows me to purchase L2_56 in two turns, saving one turn compared to taking RED tokens alone. Taking two gold tokens is possible because gold has 5 available, and I can take exactly two tokens of the same color. My token count after taking two gold will be 5, so no token return is needed. This action sets me up for a quick point acquisition and maintains flexibility for future purchases.

I cannot immediately purchase any face-up point card due to insufficient tokens.

After reserving, I will focus on collecting RED tokens to purchase L2_56 in upcoming turns, which aligns with my strategy to efficiently gain points while building bonuses for nobles.

My primary goal remains purchasing L3_80 (4 points) to trigger Noble N3 (3 points) for a total of 7 points, overtaking my opponent. L3_80 costs 7 Black, and with my 4 Black bonuses, I need 3 Black tokens. Currently, the bank has only 1 Black token. To afford L3_80, I must accumulate these tokens. I will take the single available Black token, plus 1 Green and 1 Red token. This brings my total to 9 tokens (0 White, 2 Blue, 2 Green, 2 Red, 3 Black), which is safely under the limit. While L3_87 (3 points, Red bonus) is affordable (costing 1 White token after discounts, which I can pay with 1 Gold), I prefer the efficiency of the L3_80 + Noble N3 combo (7 points) over the immediate 3 points from L3_87, especially since I can lock up the board's Black tokens.

With my 4 Black bonuses, the effective cost is 3 Black tokens, which I can pay immediately. Purchasing this card awards me 4 prestige points and grants me a White bonus. This White bonus increases my total White bonuses to 4, matching my 4 Black bonuses. This fulfills the requirements for Noble N3 (4 White, 4 Black), which will visit me for an additional 3 points. In one turn, I gain 7 prestige points (3 -> 10), taking a decisive lead over the opponent (7 points).

2025-12-31 16:22:24.060 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 7 and tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1. I have reserved card L2_56, which costs 5 RED and 3 BLACK, but with my bonuses (RED:2, BLACK:2), the effective cost is 3 RED and 1 BLACK. I currently have only 1 RED token, so I cannot purchase L2_56 immediately. The board has limited RED tokens (only 1 available), so I need to acquire additional RED tokens to enable purchasing L2_56. By taking tokens this turn, I can secure the last RED token and two other tokens to set up for purchasing L2_56 next turn. Taking RED, WHITE, and BLACK tokens allows me to increase my RED count to 2 and BLACK to 2, and with my GOLD token, I can cover the 3 RED cost next turn (using 2 RED and 1 GOLD as RED) and the 1 BLACK cost. This sequence gains me 2 points next turn, bringing my score to 9, and positions me for further point acquisition. Purchasing L2_47 now would give only 1 point and delay L2_56 due to RED token scarcity, so taking tokens is more efficient for point gain. Additionally, taking WHITE denies the opponent tokens needed for potential high-point cards like L3_77.

This card also provides a Blue bonus, increasing my Blue total to 3. My end-game target is L3_77 (4 points). L3_77 costs 6 White, 3 Blue. With my current bonuses (4 White, 3 Blue after purchase), the effective cost is only 2 White tokens. The bank currently has 2 White tokens. By purchasing L2_47 now, I set up a guaranteed win in two turns: next turn I will take the 2 White tokens, and the turn after I will purchase L3_77 to reach exactly 15 points. This path is safer than taking tokens now, as it secures a point and the necessary bonus, avoiding the risk of L2_47 being taken by the opponent or not finding a cheap 1-point card later.

2025-12-31 16:27:31.917 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 10 points and need to reach 15 efficiently. My best target is L3_77 (4 points), which effectively costs 2 White and 1 Blue token given my bonuses. Currently, the bank only has 2 White tokens, meaning I can only take 1 per turn, requiring two full turns to accumulate enough for L3_77. However, purchasing L1_34 (Red bonus, 0 pts) costs 0 tokens due to my high bonuses (4W, 2B, 1G, 4Blk). Crucially, this purchase returns 2 White tokens to the bank, increasing the total White supply to 4. This allows me to take 2 White tokens on my next turn, enabling me to purchase L3_77 immediately. This sequence (Buy L1_34 -> Take 2W -> Buy L3_77) gets me to 14 points in two turns, which is the fastest available path to victory.

This allows me to purchase L2_56 immediately, gaining 2 prestige points and increasing my score from 7 to 9. Since I have sufficient tokens, no token return is needed, and this action efficiently gains points without wasting a turn on token collection or reserving. After purchase, my token count will be 6, leaving room for future token acquisitions.

L3_77 requires 2 White tokens, but the bank only has 2 White tokens, meaning I must take 1 per turn over two turns. Buying L2_47 first would not reduce the White token requirement and would delay reaching the 14-point threshold. Therefore, I will prioritize taking White tokens now. I will take 1 White, 1 Black, and 1 Green. This brings me to 9 tokens (1 White, 2 Blue, 3 Green, 2 Red, 1 Black), setting me up to take the final White token next turn and purchase L3_77 immediately after, reaching 14 points before closing out with L2_47.

2025-12-31 16:34:04.554 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 9, needing 6 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, and I have no reserved cards. I cannot purchase any point card immediately, as all available point cards require tokens I lack. Reserving L3_77 is optimal because it offers 4 prestige points and a BLUE bonus, which I can purchase soon after acquiring one more WHITE token. After reserving, I gain a gold token, giving me WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1. With my bonuses (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:2), the effective cost for L3_77 is 4 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK tokens. I can use my 2 WHITE tokens and the gold token as WHITE to cover 3 WHITE, but I need one more WHITE token. The board has one WHITE token available, so on my next turn, I can take tokens including WHITE (e.g., WHITE, RED, BLACK) to acquire it, then purchase L3_77 on the following turn, bringing my score to 13. This secures a high-value card, denies the opponent, and leverages available tokens efficiently.

2025-12-31 16:35:44.279 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My previous plan to purchase L3_77 (4 pts) is invalid because my opponent has reserved it. I must pivot to a new path to reach 15 points. My best available target is L3_82 (5 points, White bonus), which costs 3 White and 7 Black. With my bonuses (4 White, 4 Black), the effective cost is 3 Black tokens. I currently have 1 Black token, and the bank has 2. Since I cannot take 2 Black tokens in a single turn (bank supply is 2, rule requires 4+), I must take 1 Black token per turn over two turns. This turn, I will take the available Black token, plus 1 White and 1 Red (the only other available colors). This brings my total to 12 tokens, so I must return 2. I will return 1 Blue and 1 Green, which are not needed for L3_82. After this move, I will have 2 Black tokens. The board will replenish to 4 tokens of each color at the end of the turn, allowing me to take the final Black token next turn and purchase L3_82 for the win.

To purchase L3_77, I need 4 WHITE tokens after bonuses (current cost: 6 WHITE - 2 WHITE bonus = 4 WHITE). I have 2 WHITE tokens and 1 GOLD token, covering 3 WHITE. I need one more WHITE token to cover the cost. However, the board has 0 WHITE tokens available, so I cannot take WHITE tokens this turn. By reserving a card, I gain an additional GOLD token, which can substitute for WHITE. With 2 WHITE and 2 GOLD, I can cover the 4 WHITE cost. I also have enough BLUE and BLACK tokens to cover the remaining costs (1 BLUE and 1 BLACK after bonuses). After reserving, I will have 8 tokens (under the limit), and on my next turn, I can purchase L3_77, increasing my score to 13. This action efficiently sets up a high-point purchase without wasting tokens on low-value cards.

2025-12-31 16:37:04.361 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary goal remains purchasing L3_82 (5 points) to reach 15 and win. L3_82 costs 7 Black and 3 White.

I also need to take 2 more tokens of different colors to complete a valid move (3 different colors). I will take 1 Blue and 1 Red token, which are the only other available non-zero colors (Green is also available, but Blue/Red are fine). Taking 1 Black, 1 Blue, and 1 Red brings my total tokens from 10 to 13. Since the limit is 10, I must return 3 tokens. I will return 1 Green and 2 Red, as Green is not needed for L3_82 and I have an excess of Red. After this turn, I will hold exactly 3 Black tokens, enabling me to purchase L3_82 immediately on my next turn for the win.

With bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:4, BLUE:1, BLACK:1. I have 2 WHITE tokens and 2 GOLD tokens, which I can use as WHITE to cover the 4 WHITE cost (2 WHITE + 2 GOLD as WHITE). I have 2 BLUE tokens, so I can pay 1 BLUE, and I have 1 BLACK token, so I can pay 1 BLACK. Therefore, I can purchase L3_77 immediately, gaining 4 prestige points. This brings my score to 13, putting me closer to the 15-point goal. After purchase, I will have 0 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 0 BLACK, and 0 GOLD tokens, which is under the token limit. This action is efficient because it scores points directly without delaying for token collection. I still have L3_74 reserved, which offers 5 points, but I only need 2 more points, so I can pursue smaller cards like L2_47 in future turns.

I have BLUE:1 and GREEN:1, so I need 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, and 1 GREEN. The board has WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2 available. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN tokens this turn, I will have WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2. Next turn, I can reserve a card to gain a gold token, which I can use as BLUE, allowing me to purchase L3_85 on the following turn. This sequence gains 4 points efficiently, securing a win without wasting turns on low-value cards.
