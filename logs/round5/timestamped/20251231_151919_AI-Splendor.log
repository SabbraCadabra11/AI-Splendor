2025-12-31 15:20:15.522 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 1 opening strategy. The available Nobles (N5, N10, N2) heavily favor Red and Black gems. To secure these, I should target Level 1 cards that produce these colors. L1_38 produces a Red gem and costs 2 White and 2 Red. L1_6 produces a Black gem and costs 2 White and 2 Green. None of the visible Level 1 cards require Black tokens to purchase. Thus, the most efficient move is to gather the resources for L1_38 and L1_6: White, Red, and Green. Taking these three tokens now maximizes flexibility, allowing me to potentially afford either card by Turn 3 after a second collection.

2025-12-31 15:23:30.550 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: This is turn 1 and I have no tokens, cards, or bonuses. The opponent has 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED. My first move should maximize token collection efficiency. Taking 3 different color tokens is optimal here since I have 0 tokens and won't exceed the 10-token limit.

Board supply analysis:
- WHITE: 3 available (scarce, opponent has some)
- BLUE: 4 available (abundant)  
- GREEN: 3 available (scarce, opponent has some)
- RED: 3 available (scarce, opponent has some)
- BLACK: 4 available (abundant)

Strategic considerations:
1. I should target colors that are useful for early Level 1 cards while maintaining flexibility
2. L1_40 (1 prestige point, costs 4 WHITE) is appealing early-game target
3. BLUE and BLACK are abundant and useful for multiple cards (L1_28 needs 3 BLUE, many cards need BLACK)
4. WHITE is needed for several cards including the 1-point L1_40

Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK gives me:
- One scarce color (WHITE) that opponent is also collecting
- Two abundant colors for flexibility
- Pathway to multiple cards including L1_40 for early points
- Total will be 3 tokens, well under the 10-token limit

Alternative of taking 2 tokens (2 BLUE or 2 BLACK) is suboptimal as it yields fewer resources. Reserving a card now would waste a turn since I have no tokens to work with. Purchasing is impossible with 0 tokens.

2025-12-31 15:24:08.333 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My strategy continues to focus on securing Level 1 cards that provide Red or Black bonuses for the available Nobles (N5, N10, N2). I currently possess 1 White, 1 Red, and 1 Green token. Two optimal cards are available: L1_38 (Red bonus, costs 2 White/2 Red) and L1_6 (Black bonus, costs 2 White/2 Green). To afford L1_38, I need 1 more White and 1 more Red. To afford L1_6, I need 1 more White and 1 more Green. By taking White, Red, and Green tokens now, I will reach 2 of each, ensuring I have the resources to purchase one of these key cards on the very next turn. Since there are only 2 White tokens remaining on the board, securing one now is critical.

2025-12-31 15:28:00.772 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Analyzing turn 2 as Player 1 with current tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1). Opponent has WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2 and can potentially purchase L1_6 or L1_38 this turn. Board supply shows WHITE is extremely scarce (only 1 remaining). 

Strategic priorities:
1. Block opponent from critical WHITE tokens they're clearly targeting for multiple Level 1 cards
2. Position myself for L1_28 (costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) which gives GREEN bonus - helpful for N2 noble
3. Maintain token flexibility while staying well under 10-token limit

Taking WHITE (1 available), BLUE (3 available), and GREEN (2 available) achieves all goals:
- Secures last WHITE token before opponent can take it
- Puts me 1 BLUE token away from affording L1_28 (will have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1)
- Gives me resource diversity needed for multiple purchase paths
- Results in 6 total tokens, no returns needed
- Avoids wasted turn from reserving when I need more tokens

Alternative actions considered:
- Reserving: Too early, would slow token collection when I need resources
- Purchasing: Cannot afford any card yet
- Taking other color combos: Would concede scarce WHITE to opponent who's already positioned to use it

This move efficiently builds my economy while disrupting opponent's plans.

Two optimal Level 1 cards are available: L1_6 (Black bonus, costs 2 White/2 Green) and L1_38 (Red bonus, costs 2 White/2 Red). While both benefit my Noble strategy (N5, N10), the opponent (Player 1) has 2 White and 1 Green, with 1 Green available on the board. This puts them just one token away from affording L1_6. Conversely, they have 0 Red tokens and are far from affording L1_38. Therefore, the strategic move is to purchase L1_6 immediately to secure the Black bonus and deny the card to the opponent. I will retain my 2 Red tokens, allowing me to target L1_38 or similar cards in future turns once I replenish my White tokens.

I cannot purchase any cards yet - closest is L1_28 needing 1 more BLUE, or L1_23 also needing 1 more BLUE. The opponent has RED:2 and is positioned for RED-heavy cards like L1_38. Both available nobles (N5 and N2) require RED:4, so acquiring RED tokens is strategically important to compete for nobles and block opponent. Board has RED:2 available, which is moderate supply. Taking BLUE (to reach 3), RED (to start collecting this key color), and GREEN (useful for L1_28 and N2 noble) gives me optimal resource distribution. This results in 9 total tokens, well under the 10-token limit with no returns needed. Alternative of taking WHITE instead of RED would concede the important RED color to opponent and ignore noble requirements.

2025-12-31 15:29:56.675 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Strategy focuses on acquiring Red and Black bonuses to satisfy Nobles N5, N10, and N2. Card L1_38 is critical as it provides a Red bonus and costs 2 White and 2 Red. The opponent currently holds 2 White and 1 Red token, leaving them only 1 Red token away from purchasing this specific card. Since there is 1 Red token available on the board, the opponent could take it this turn and purchase the card next turn. To prevent this and secure the card for myself, I must reserve it. This action also grants me a Gold token, which acts as a wildcard, effectively providing me with 1 of the 2 required White tokens (since I currently have 0). This positions me to purchase the card shortly after collecting just one more White token.

2025-12-31 15:33:24.653 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 9 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1), which means I cannot take more tokens without returning at least 2. Since I can afford multiple cards, purchasing is optimal to avoid wasting a turn returning tokens.

Purchase options analysis:
- L1_23 costs {BLUE:3} - exactly matches my BLUE token count
- L1_28 costs {WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1} - uses 3 colors
- L1_18 costs {BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1} - depletes most of my tokens

L1_23 is the most efficient purchase because:
1. It uses exactly my scarce BLUE tokens (BLUE only has 1 token left on board)
2. Gives me a WHITE bonus, useful for future purchases like L1_40 (costs WHITE:4) and N10 noble (needs WHITE:3)
3. Leaves me with 6 tokens (WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1), maintaining flexibility
4. No returns needed, maximizing turn efficiency
5. Prevents waste of a turn while at 9 tokens

Other actions considered:
- Taking 2 tokens: Not possible (no color has 4+ on board)
- Taking 3 tokens: Would require returning 2+ tokens, which is wasteful
- Reserving: Would require returns and doesn't advance my board position as much as a direct purchase

This purchase gives me my first bonus and positions me for future point-scoring cards while maintaining token flexibility.

2025-12-31 15:34:37.355 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My immediate priority is to purchase the reserved card L1_38 (Red bonus) to develop my Red/Black engine for Nobles N5 and N10. L1_38 costs 2 White and 2 Red. I currently hold 2 Red and 1 Gold, but 0 White tokens. To afford the 2 White cost, I must use my Gold token and acquire 1 White token. Therefore, taking a White token this turn is mandatory. For the remaining two tokens, I should target resources for my next likely acquisitions: L1_18 (White bonus) and L1_31 (Green bonus). L1_18 requires Green tokens (cost 1B, 2G, 1R, 1K; discounts apply), and L1_31 requires Red tokens (cost 3R). The board has only 1 Red token remaining, making it a scarce resource that I should secure before the opponent can. Taking Green prepares me for L1_18. Thus, taking White, Green, and Red is the most efficient move, allowing me to buy L1_38 next turn while building stock for future turns.

2025-12-31 15:37:29.501 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 5 analysis as Player 1:

Current state: I have 6 tokens (WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1) and 1 WHITE bonus. Opponent has 3 RED tokens and reserved L1_38 (needs 2 WHITE, 2 RED), showing they're committed to a RED/WHITE strategy.

Board token crisis: WHITE and GREEN are extremely scarce (only 1 each available), RED is exhausted (0), while BLUE is abundant (4).

Purchase evaluation: I cannot afford any Level 1 cards. L1_28 needs 3 BLUE (I have 0), L1_40 needs 4 WHITE (I have effective 3), L1_18 needs 1 BLUE (I have 0). No purchase possible.

Token strategy: At 6 tokens, I can take 3 without returning. Taking the last WHITE token blocks opponent's reserved L1_38. Taking the last GREEN token denies opponent's noble aspirations (N2 needs GREEN:4). Taking BLUE builds toward L1_28 which is my most accessible card (3 BLUE needed).

This combination maximizes disruption, builds toward my first prestige point (L1_28 gives 0 points but enables future purchases), and wastes nothing. My tokens will be: WHITE:3 (4 effective), GREEN:3, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 = 9 total.

Better than reserving because I'm not at token limit and need resources, not just a gold token.

This card is highly valuable as it grants 1 Prestige Point and a Red bonus—a color critical for all three available Nobles (N5, N10, N2). Allowing the opponent to secure a point and start their Red engine would be a strategic error. Therefore, I will reserve L1_40 to deny it to them. This action grants me a second Gold token, which ensures I can still purchase my previously reserved card (L1_38) on the following turn.

2025-12-31 15:42:24.912 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Analyzing turn 6 as Player 1:

Current state: I have 9 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1) and 1 WHITE bonus. Opponent has 3 RED tokens and reserved cards requiring WHITE (L1_38 needs WHITE:2, L1_40 needs WHITE:4).

Critical board analysis: WHITE, GREEN, and RED tokens are all exhausted (0 available). Only BLUE:3 and BLACK:3 remain. This means I cannot take 3 different color tokens (only 2 colors available) and cannot take 2 tokens of the same color (no color has 4+ available). Therefore, I **cannot take any tokens** this turn.

My only options are purchase or reserve. Since I can afford multiple cards, purchasing is strictly better than reserving.

Purchase options:
1. L1_18 costs {BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1} - I have exactly these tokens
2. L1_29 costs {WHITE:2, BLUE:1} - With my WHITE bonus, I need only BLUE:1 (which I have)

Strategic evaluation:
- L1_18 gives WHITE bonus (would have WHITE:2 total), making me dominant for WHITE cards and N10 noble
- It uses RED and BLACK tokens which are now worthless (exhausted from board)
- After purchase, I'll have only 4 tokens (WHITE:3, GREEN:1), giving me flexibility to take 3 tokens next turn
- This blocks opponent's path to N10 noble and strengthens my position against their WHITE-dependent reserved cards
- L1_29 would give GREEN bonus but leave me with 6 tokens and doesn't address the scarce resource situation as effectively

L1_18 is the optimal purchase for board control, noble competition, and resource efficiency.

2025-12-31 15:43:00.296 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have successfully assembled the resources to purchase my reserved card L1_38. This card provides a Red bonus, which is essential for all three active Nobles (N5, N10, N2). The card costs 2 White and 2 Red. I currently hold 1 White token, 3 Red tokens, and 2 Gold tokens. To pay the cost, I will spend my 1 White token, use 1 Gold token to substitute for the missing second White token, and spend 2 Red tokens. This purchase solidifies my Red/Black engine foundation and frees up token capacity to work towards the next objective, potentially L1_40 or L1_31.

2025-12-31 15:45:40.726 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 4 tokens (WHITE:3, GREEN:1) and 2 WHITE bonuses. Opponent has 3 tokens (GREEN:1, RED:1, GOLD:1) and RED:1, BLACK:1 bonuses.

**Purchase opportunity identified**: L2_45 costs WHITE:5. With my WHITE bonus:2, I need exactly WHITE:3 tokens, which I have. This gives me:
- 2 prestige points (immediate lead)
- BLACK bonus (diversifying my economy to WHITE:2, BLACK:1)
- Uses resources efficiently while board has WHITE:1 token remaining

**Why this is optimal**:
1. **Immediate points**: 2 points is 13% of the 15-point goal, giving me early momentum
2. **Bonus diversification**: BLACK bonus opens path to N5 and N10 nobles
3. **Resource efficiency**: Uses my WHITE tokens which are replaceable (board still has WHITE:1), while preserving flexibility to collect scarce colors next turn
4. **Opponent cannot block**: They have 0 WHITE tokens and 0 WHITE bonuses - they cannot afford L2_45
5. **Token management**: After purchase, I'll have only GREEN:1 token, allowing me to take 3 new tokens next turn without returns

**Alternatives rejected**:
- Taking tokens: Slower, gives no points, and I have room to take tokens AFTER this purchase
- Reserving: No need to reserve when I can get immediate points and a bonus
- Other purchases: No other cards are affordable with current tokens/bonuses
- L1_29 looks close but requires BLUE:1 which I lack

**Noble considerations**: After this purchase, I'll have WHITE:2 and BLACK:1 bonuses. N10 needs WHITE:3 RED:3 BLACK:3 - I'll need RED bonuses next. N5 needs BLACK:4 RED:4 - possible long-term target. N2 needs GREEN:4 RED:4 - less aligned with my WHITE/BLACK path.

This purchase gives me the best immediate value while maintaining strategic flexibility.

2025-12-31 15:46:43.798 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My next immediate target is the available card L1_31 (Green bonus), which costs 3 Red. I currently hold 1 Red bonus and 1 Red token, meaning I need exactly one more Red resource to purchase it without spending my Gold token. I also need to accumulate White tokens to afford my reserved card L1_40 (1 Prestige, Red bonus, costs 4 White), for which I currently have 0 White tokens. Finally, Black tokens are required for higher-tier cards like L2_65 and my Noble objectives (N5, N10). Since I have ample token capacity (currently 4/10) and buying L1_31 now would waste a valuable Gold token better utilized for the expensive L1_40, the most efficient move is to gather resources. The board has sufficient supply to take White, Red, and Black.

Opponent has 6 tokens including RED:2 and is collecting WHITE for their reserved L1_40. I cannot purchase any cards (L1_29 needs BLUE:1 which I lack). I should take 3 different color tokens to build toward nobles N10/N5 and target card L1_8. RED is critical (both nobles need it, only 2 available) and taking 1 blocks opponent's RED collection. BLACK is important for nobles (3 available). BLUE builds toward L1_8 (costs BLUE:4, gives BLACK:1, 1 point) and is abundant. Taking RED, BLACK, BLUE gives me resources for both nobles and card acquisition while denying opponent scarce RED tokens. Total tokens after = 4 (GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, BLUE:1), well under limit.

2025-12-31 15:52:37.394 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary objective is to acquire the high-value card L2_65 (1 Prestige Point, Red bonus). This card is ideal for my strategy as it provides a Red bonus necessary for Nobles N5 and N10. The card costs 2 White, 2 Red, and 3 Black. I currently hold 1 White token, 2 Red tokens, and 1 Black token (plus 1 Black bonus). This leaves me with a deficit of exactly 1 White token and 1 Black token to purchase it next turn. Crucially, the opponent is also targeting this card or similar Red/Black components; they need exactly 1 Red and 1 Black token to afford L2_65 (they have 2 White bonuses, 1 Red token, and 2 Black power). By taking the last available Red token from the board, I effectively deny them the ability to buy this card soon while securing the exact resources I need. Therefore, I will take White, Black, and Red tokens.

2025-12-31 15:58:19.581 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Critical analysis reveals opponent (Player 0) can purchase L2_65 this turn: they have WHITE:2 tokens, RED:3 tokens + RED:1 bonus = effective RED:4, and BLACK:2 tokens + BLACK:1 bonus = effective BLACK:3, exactly matching L2_65's cost of WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3. If they purchase it, they gain a RED bonus (totaling RED:2) and 1 prestige point, putting them in direct competition for nobles N5 and N10. 

My current state: 4 tokens (BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1), bonuses WHITE:2, BLACK:1, score 2. 

Strategic evaluation: I cannot afford L2_65 yet (need RED:2, BLACK:2 net after bonuses, have RED:1, BLACK:1), but opponent can. Reserving L2_65 achieves multiple objectives:
1. Blocks opponent from acquiring critical RED bonus and point
2. Secures RED bonus for my own noble strategy (N10 and N5 both require RED)
3. Grants GOLD:1 token (board has GOLD:4 available) for future purchase flexibility
4. Maintains reasonable token count (5 total after gaining gold)

Alternative options are suboptimal:
- Purchasing L1_29 (costs BLUE:1) gives only GREEN bonus with 0 points, doesn't address the immediate threat
- Taking tokens wastes opportunity to block opponent's key card while they're at 9 tokens and can purchase it now
- Other cards are either too expensive or don't provide RED bonus

This reservation is a defensive necessity that simultaneously advances my noble strategy. After reserving, I'll have tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1, and can work toward purchasing L2_65 next turn by collecting RED and BLACK tokens.

2025-12-31 15:59:13.651 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have identified an excellent opportunity to acquire points and develop my engine simultaneously. The card L2_56 offers 2 Prestige Points and a White bonus, costing 5 Red and 3 Black resources. My current purchasing power for Red is 5 (1 Red bonus + 3 Red tokens + 1 Gold token) and for Black is 3 (1 Black bonus + 2 Black tokens). Buying this card allows me to convert my accumulated tokens—which are nearing the limit of 10—into immediate score and a permanent Tier 2 bonus. The White bonus is strategically vital as it contributes towards the cost of my reserved card L1_40 (requires 4 White) and the Noble N10 (requires 3 White, 3 Red, 3 Black). Although returning tokens to the board might assist the opponent slightly, securing 2 points and advancing my own tech tree is the superior move compared to stagnation.

My reserved L2_65 requires WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3. I cannot afford any purchase this turn - L1_29 needs BLUE:1 which I have, but buying it would give me a useless GREEN bonus with 0 points, waste my turn, and delay my L2_65 plan. Taking RED, BLACK, and BLUE tokens is optimal: RED and BLACK directly complete the requirements for L2_65 (I'll have RED:2 tokens, BLACK:2 tokens + 1 bonus = effective BLACK:3), allowing me to purchase it next turn for 1 prestige point and a crucial RED bonus. BLUE builds toward L1_8 (costs BLUE:4) which gives another BLACK bonus and 1 point. I cannot block opponent's L1_40 purchase - they need 1 WHITE token and board has WHITE:2 available, and the rules prevent me from taking both. After taking these 3 tokens I'll have 8 total, well under the limit, and be perfectly positioned to execute my noble strategy toward N10 (needs WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3) and N5 (needs BLACK:4, RED:4).

2025-12-31 16:07:44.062 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My priority is to finalize the purchase of my reserved card L1_40, which grants 1 Prestige Point and a Red bonus. This card requires 4 White resources. Currently, I have 1 White bonus (via L2_56 purchased last turn) and 2 White tokens, leaving me with a deficit of exactly 1 White. To address this, I will take tokens from the board. I will select White (to afford L1_40), Red, and Black. Red is critical for all three active Nobles (N5, N10, N2) and Black is necessary for N5 and N10. This aligns perfectly with my existing bonuses and prepares me for future high-value purchases while keeping my token count (moving to 6) flexible.

2025-12-31 16:10:19.800 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens (BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLACK:1. My reserved card L2_65 costs WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3. With my bonuses, I need exactly RED:2 and BLACK:2 tokens, which I currently have. This is a perfect purchase opportunity because:

1. **Immediate points**: Gain 1 prestige point (score becomes 3, taking the lead)
2. **Critical bonus**: Acquire RED bonus, which is essential for competing for both N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3) and N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4) nobles
3. **Resource efficiency**: Uses my RED and BLACK tokens productively rather than letting them sit idle
4. **Token management**: After purchase, I'll have only 4 tokens (BLUE:2, GREEN:1, GOLD:1), well under the limit, allowing me to take 3 more tokens next turn without discarding
5. **Blocks opponent**: Prevents opponent from gaining this RED bonus and secures my path to nobles

Opponent is at 6 tokens with 3 WHITE tokens and will likely purchase their reserved L1_40 (WHITE:4) next turn to gain a RED bonus. I must secure my own RED bonus now to stay competitive. Other options are inferior:
- Taking tokens gives no points and wastes this purchase opportunity
- Buying L1_29 gives only a useless GREEN bonus with 0 points
- Reserving a card is unnecessary when I can get immediate value

This purchase gives me the lead in points and positions me strongly for noble acquisition.

This sequence outpaces the opponent, who currently lacks the Red resources to buy L1_31 immediately.

2025-12-31 16:19:51.376 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 4 tokens (BLUE:2, GREEN:1, GOLD:1) and 3 prestige points with bonuses WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1. Opponent also has 3 points. I cannot purchase any point-scoring cards this turn (L1_8 costs BLUE:4). I could purchase L1_29 (costing 1 BLUE token for a useless GREEN bonus) or L1_28 (costing 2 BLUE + 1 GREEN + 1 GOLD for a GREEN bonus), but neither helps my noble strategy for N10/N5 which requires RED and BLACK bonuses with points. 

Strategic evaluation: Taking BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 is optimal because:
1. **Builds toward L1_8**: I'll have BLUE:3 tokens + 1 gold, allowing me to purchase L1_8 next turn for 1 prestige point and a crucial BLACK bonus (advancing both N10 and N5)
2. **Collects strategic colors**: RED token builds toward L2_70 (3 points + RED bonus) and L3_74 (5 points + BLACK bonus); BLACK token also builds toward L3_74
3. **Blocks opponent**: Opponent needs RED and BLACK tokens for their noble strategy - taking these denies them scarce resources
4. **Maintains efficiency**: Total tokens will be 7, well under the 10-token limit
5. **No wasted turns**: Unlike buying L1_29/L1_28 for zero points, this positions me for multiple future scoring opportunities

Alternative analysis: Reserving cards would waste a turn when I can make progress; buying GREEN-bonus cards doesn't align with my N10/N5 strategy; taking WHITE tokens doesn't help purchase any visible cards. This token collection is the most flexible and strategic move.

2025-12-31 16:20:21.794 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: As planned in my previous turn, I will purchase the Level 1 card L1_31. It provides a Green bonus and costs 3 Red. I currently possess 2 Red bonuses and 1 Red token, allowing me to afford this card exactly by spending the 1 Red token. Acquiring this Green bonus is the first step towards qualifying for Noble N2 (requires 4 Green, 4 Red), which complements my existing strength in Red. This move consumes one token, leaving me with Green and Black tokens to start building towards other objectives, while efficiently converting my Red resources into permanent infrastructure.

2025-12-31 16:21:30.272 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 7 tokens (BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, with score 3. The opponent has only 2 tokens (GREEN:1, BLACK:1) and score 3, but has strong RED:2 bonuses making them a threat for nobles N5 and N10. I need to evaluate immediate scoring opportunities:

**Purchase Options:**
- L1_8 costs BLUE:4 and gives 1 prestige point + BLACK bonus. I have BLUE:3 + GOLD:1, so I can afford it now! This is perfect because it gives me immediate points, a BLACK bonus needed for both N10 and N5, and brings me to 4 total points.
- L1_29 costs BLUE:1 but gives only a useless GREEN bonus with 0 points - inferior to L1_8
- L1_28 costs BLUE:3 + GOLD:1 + GREEN:1 but gives only GREEN bonus with 0 points - worse than L1_8
- L1_5 costs GREEN:2, RED:1 - I have the tokens but gives 0 points

**Token Taking Options:**
- Taking RED, BLACK, BLUE would give me 10 tokens but I'd need to discard 1 (waste) and doesn't score points now
- Taking 2 BLUE is impossible (only BLUE:1 available on board)

**Strategic Analysis:**
L1_8 is the clear optimal move. It immediately scores 1 point (putting me at 4 total), gives BLACK bonus (advancing toward both N10 [needs BLACK:3] and N5 [needs BLACK:4]), and efficiently uses my BLUE tokens and gold. After purchase, I'll have tokens: BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (total 3 tokens), well under limit. This also blocks opponent from getting this card and solidifies my lead. The opponent is low on tokens (2 total) and cannot immediately threaten my position. I should take the guaranteed point now rather than delay.

2025-12-31 16:22:25.530 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My strategy focuses on securing Nobles N5 and N10, which require substantial Black and Red bonuses. I currently have 1 Black bonus and 2 Red bonuses. The card L1_5 is available, offering a Black bonus for the cost of 2 Green and 1 Red. With my 1 Green bonus and 1 Green token, plus 2 Red bonuses, I can purchase this card immediately by spending only my single Green token. This is a highly efficient move that increases my Black bonus count to 2—crucial progress towards both targeted Nobles—while retaining my Black token to help acquire future cards like L1_22 (White bonus).

2025-12-31 16:30:57.991 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 4 points, opponent has 3 points. I hold 3 tokens (GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) with bonuses WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2. I cannot afford any face-up card this turn - the cheapest point-bearing card (L2_70) requires RED:5 net after my bonuses, and I only have RED:1 token. 

The opponent is token-starved with only 1 BLACK token but has strong bonuses (RED:2, BLACK:2) and is also competing for nobles N5 and N10. They cannot purchase any high-value cards now but could reserve them. 

Strategic decision: Reserving L3_74 is optimal because:
1. **Secures 5 points**: This is the highest point value visible on the board
2. **BLOCKS opponent**: Prevents them from acquiring this crucial BLACK bonus card they need for their noble strategy
3. **Advances my noble strategy**: The BLACK bonus brings me to BLACK:3, completing the BLACK requirement for noble N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)
4. **Grants flexibility**: I receive GOLD:1 token (board has 5 available) for future purchase options
5. **Resource optimization**: After reserving, I'll have 4 tokens total (GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1), well under the 10-token limit, allowing aggressive token collection next turn
6. **No immediate threat**: The opponent cannot afford this card now (needs RED:5 net, has 0 RED tokens), but could reserve it if I don't act first

The effective cost is RED:6, BLACK:1 after my bonuses. I can collect RED tokens over the next 2-3 turns while maintaining my lead. Alternative options like taking tokens would waste this opportunity to secure a game-winning card and allow opponent to block my strategy.

2025-12-31 16:31:58.672 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have identified two Level 1 cards that are excellent fits for my engine: L1_37 (Red bonus) and L1_22 (White bonus). Both cards require exactly 2 Blue resources to purchase, given my existing bonuses (Green covers L1_37's Green cost; Black covers L1_22's Black cost). Currently, I possess 0 Blue resources. Since there are 4 Blue tokens available on the board, the most efficient move is to take 2 Blue tokens immediately. This will provide the exact resources needed to purchase either L1_37 or L1_22 on my next turn. I plan to prioritize L1_37 to increase my Red bonus count to 3, which is a critical threshold for Nobles N5 (requires 4 Red), N10 (requires 3 Red), and N2 (requires 4 Red). Taking 2 Blue tokens now is faster than taking 3 different tokens, as it enables a purchase on the very next turn.

2025-12-31 16:34:06.236 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 4 points, opponent has 3 points. I hold 4 tokens (GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) with bonuses WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, and have L3_74 reserved (5 points + BLACK bonus). The opponent also targets nobles N5/N10 with bonuses RED:2, BLACK:2 but only has 3 tokens, making them resource-starved.

**Strategic Priority:** Purchase L3_74 (net cost after bonuses: RED:6, BLACK:1). I currently have RED:1, BLACK:1 tokens, needing 5 more RED tokens.

**Evaluation of Options:**
- **Purchasing**: No affordable point-scoring cards. L3_74 costs RED:6 net - I only have RED:1.
- **Reserving**: Unnecessary - I already hold the best card (5 points) and cannot afford alternatives.
- **Token Collection**: Taking 2 RED tokens is optimal because:
  1. **Direct Progress**: Gets me 40% of the way to L3_74 in one turn (need 5 more RED, gain 2 now)
  2. **Blocks Opponent**: Opponent needs RED tokens desperately for their noble strategy (N5/N10 require RED:4+). Taking scarce RED tokens denies them critical resources
  3. **Efficiency**: After taking 2 RED, I'll have 6 total tokens (well under 10 limit), no returns needed
  4. **Noble Positioning**: Once I get L3_74's BLACK bonus, I'll have BLACK:3, meeting N10's requirement and advancing toward N5
  5. **Maintains Lead**: While opponent is token-starved, I build toward the game-winning 5-point card

**Board Check**: RED tokens available = 3 (≥4 required for taking 2). Valid move.

**Result**: Taking 2 RED tokens is the most aggressive, efficient path to victory while simultaneously blocking my opponent's noble ambitions.

2025-12-31 16:38:22.106 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state: I have 4 points, opponent has 3 points. I hold 4 tokens (GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) with bonuses WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, and my reserved L3_74 (5 points) needs RED:6, BLACK:1 after applying bonuses. No immediate purchases are possible. 

Strategic analysis: My path to victory is securing L3_74 which requires 5 more RED tokens. I must start collecting RED immediately while blocking opponent's access to scarce resources. The opponent has strong RED:2 and BLACK:2 bonuses, so denying them RED and BLACK is critical.

Optimal move: Take RED:1, WHITE:1, BLACK:1 tokens because:
1. **Direct progress**: RED is essential for L3_74 (my 5-point game-winner) - collecting RED now reduces acquisition time by one turn
2. **Noble positioning**: WHITE and BLACK advance my position toward N10 (WHITE:3, BLACK:3) and N5 (BLACK:4) 
3. **Opponent blocking**: Opponent needs RED/BLACK for their noble strategy - taking these denies them scarce board resources
4. **Token efficiency**: Increases from 4 to 7 tokens, well under the 10-token limit with no waste
5. **Scarcity management**: BLACK only has 2 tokens on board - taking one now is important

Alternative options evaluated:
- Taking 2 WHITE tokens: doesn't advance L3_74 plan and wastes a RED collection opportunity
- Reserving another card: dilutes focus from L3_74 and wastes precious turns when I should be collecting RED
- Purchasing cheaper cards: none are affordable with current tokens

This move maintains my lead while accelerating my primary scoring path and disrupting opponent's strategy.

2025-12-31 16:38:53.949 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Following through on last turn's plan, I will purchase the Level 1 card L1_37. This card provides a Red bonus and costs 2 Blue and 1 Green. My current resources include 2 Blue tokens (acquired specifically for this purpose) and 1 Green bonus (from previously purchased cards), which exactly covers the cost. I will spend the 2 Blue tokens to finalize this transaction. This move is strategically vital because it raises my Red bonus count to 3, satisfying the Red requirement for Noble N10 and bringing me within one Red bonus of the requirement for Nobles N5 and N2. Securing this third Red bonus is the most efficient path to unlocking the high-value Nobles that will drive my score.

2025-12-31 16:41:30.798 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current analysis: I lead 4-3 and hold 7 tokens (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) with bonuses WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2. My primary path to victory is purchasing reserved L3_74 (5 points), which requires RED:6, BLACK:1 net from tokens after applying bonuses. I currently have RED:2 tokens, needing 4 more RED. The opponent is token-starved with only 1 BLACK token but has strong bonuses and competes for the same nobles.

Strategic evaluation: Taking RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1 is optimal because:
1. **Direct progress to victory**: RED is critical - each token reduces my L3_74 acquisition time. I need 4 more RED; this gets me 25% closer.
2. **Noble positioning**: WHITE advances me toward N10 (requires WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3). After L3_74, I'll have BLACK:3, so WHITE:1 brings me to WHITE:2, needing only WHITE:1 more.
3. **Resource denial**: RED is scarce (only 2 on board) and BLACK very scarce (only 1). Taking both blocks opponent's noble strategy for N5/N10 while securing my BLACK:1 requirement for L3_74.
4. **Perfect token efficiency**: Increases from 7 to exactly 10 tokens (the limit) with zero waste: WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:1. No returns needed.
5. **Maintains lead**: Opponent cannot purchase L3_74 (needs RED tokens they lack) or other high-value cards this turn. This move secures my advantage while accelerating my win condition.

Alternative options are inferior: Taking BLUE would waste a slot on a color I don't need; reserving another card would delay my primary scoring path by a full turn; purchasing 0-point cards provides no value. This token collection is the most strategic and efficient move.

I currently have 1 White, 3 Red, and 2 Black bonuses. Therefore, obtaining White and Black bonuses is my highest priority. I have identified the card L1_22 on the board, which provides a White bonus. Its cost is 2 Blue and 2 Black. Since I already possess 2 Black bonuses, the effective cost for me is only 2 Blue resources. I currently have 0 Blue tokens. There are 4 Blue tokens available on the board, which allows me to take exactly 2 Blue tokens in a single turn. This is the most efficient move as it provides the exact resources required to purchase L1_22 on my next turn, advancing my White bonus count to 2 and bringing me significantly closer to claiming Noble N10.

2025-12-31 16:47:19.128 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I lead 4-3 and am at the token limit (10 tokens: WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:1). My reserved L3_74 (5 points) requires RED:6, BLACK:1 net cost after bonuses. I currently have RED:3 tokens, so I need 3 more RED to purchase it. The board has only RED:1 available, which is also critical for my opponent's noble strategy.

Strategic decision: Taking RED:1, WHITE:1, GREEN:1 while returning GREEN:1, WHITE:1, BLACK:1 is optimal because:
1. **Secures scarce RED**: Gets me 1/3 of the RED tokens I need for L3_74 while denying my opponent access to the only available RED token
2. **Maintains token limit**: I'm at 10 tokens, so taking 3 requires returning 3; returning GREEN and excess WHITE/BLACK minimizes waste
3. **Board availability**: WHITE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1 are all available on the board
4. **Maintains flexibility**: After this move, I'll have WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (total 10), positioning me to buy L3_74 with just 1 more RED token plus efficient gold usage
5. **Opponent blocking**: Opponent needs RED for their N5/N10 noble strategy; denying this RED token significantly slows their progress
6. **Preserves win condition**: This is the fastest path to 9+ points via L3_74, maintaining my lead

Alternative options are inferior: Reserving another card would waste a turn and require returning a token anyway; purchasing 0-point cards provides no value; taking other color combinations doesn't advance my primary scoring path. This is the most efficient move toward victory.

2025-12-31 16:52:05.698 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current situation: I have 4 points, 10 tokens (WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) and a reserved L3_74 that will give 5 points. To reach 15 points I plan to buy L3_74 (5pts), then L3_80 (4pts, WHITE bonus) and claim noble N10 (3pts) – total 4+5+4+3 = 16 points. The immediate obstacle is that L3_74 costs net RED:6 and BLACK:1. I have RED:4 tokens and GOLD:1, so I am two RED tokens short. Since the board has RED:0 this turn I cannot acquire those reds now. The fastest way to enable the purchase next turn is to obtain a second gold token so I can substitute the two missing reds. The only way to get a gold token while staying at the token limit is to reserve a card (I can have up to 3 reserved cards and currently have only L3_74). Reserving a visible card also lets me block an opponent’s potential acquisition. L3_80 fits my later plan (white bonus for N10) and is a 4‑point card the opponent could eventually aim for, so reserving it now is doubly beneficial. I will return the GREEN token, a color I have no use for, to keep my token count legal. After this move I will have WHITE:2, RED:4, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 – exactly the tokens I need to buy L3_74 on the next turn by paying RED:4 + GOLD:2 + BLACK:1. This secures my path to 9 points and positions me to win with L3_80 and N10.

2025-12-31 16:53:05.766 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary goals are Nobles N10 and N5, but there are no Level 1 or Level 2 cards currently on the board that provide the necessary White or Black bonuses. However, I can execute a highly efficient sequence to build my engine and cycle the board. I will purchase L1_15 (Blue bonus), which costs 3 Black. I possess 2 Black bonuses and 1 Black token, allowing me to buy this card immediately and utilize my only token. Gaining this Blue bonus is strategically pivotal because it perfectly covers the missing requirement for two other cards on the board: L1_29 (Green bonus, costs 2 White, 1 Blue) and L1_25 (Green bonus, costs 1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Black). With my existing bonuses (2 White, 3 Red, 2 Black) plus the new Blue bonus, I will be able to acquire both of these Green cards for 'free' (0 tokens) in subsequent turns. This rapidly increases my bonus count, advancing me towards Noble N2 (requires 4 Green, 4 Red) and cycling the Level 1 deck to hopefully reveal the White and Black cards I need for my main Noble targets.

2025-12-31 16:53:17.208 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Time to win. 

Current state: I have 4 points, 10 tokens (WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2, GOLD:2) and 2 gold tokens. My reserved L3_74 costs net RED:6, BLACK:1 after my bonuses (RED:1, BLACK:2). I currently have RED:4 tokens and GOLD:2, which means I can pay RED:4 + GOLD:2 to satisfy the RED:6 requirement, and pay BLACK:1 from my BLACK:2 tokens.

Strategic reasoning:
1. **IMMEDIATE VICTORY PATH**: Purchasing L3_74 gives me 5 prestige points immediately, bringing my total to 9 points
2. **OPTIMAL TOKEN USAGE**: I can afford the card RIGHT NOW. With RED:4 tokens + 2 gold substituting for the remaining 2 RED, and BLACK:2 tokens to pay the BLACK:1 requirement, I have exactly what I need
3. **NO WASTED TURNS**: I've spent the last 5 turns preparing for this exact moment. Taking any other action now would be a massive strategic blunder
4. **BOARD STATE**: There's still RED:0 on board, so I couldn't collect more RED tokens anyway. This is my window
5. **OPPONENT THREAT**: My opponent has 3 points and strong bonuses but cannot purchase any high-value cards this turn. They need RED tokens for their strategy which aren't available
6. **POST-PURCHASE POSITION**: After buying L3_74, I'll have BLACK:3 bonus (completing N10 requirement), and I'll be at 9 points total, needing only 6 more to win. I still have L3_80 reserved for 4 more points and can target N10 for 3 points (total: 9+4+3=16)

This is the decisive move that executes my entire strategy. I must purchase L3_74 now.

2025-12-31 16:55:01.769 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have identified the Level 2 card L2_70 (3 Prestige Points, Red bonus) as the most critical component for my victory. It provides the 4th Red bonus, which is the missing key to triggering both Noble N5 (requires 4 Red, 4 Black) and Noble N2 (requires 4 Green, 4 Red). Although there are 'free' Level 1 Green cards available to purchase immediately (L1_29, L1_25, L1_27), L2_70 is a unique, high-value target that my opponent (currently at 9 VP) might also target or reserve. Since I currently lack the tokens to purchase it outright (Cost 6 Red; I have 3 Red bonuses and 0 tokens), the safest and most efficient line of play is to Reserve L2_70 now. This secures the card against my opponent and provides me with 1 Gold token. On the next turn, I can take 2 Red tokens (since 4 are available), giving me exactly enough resources (1 Gold + 2 Red tokens + 3 Red bonuses = 6 Red) to purchase L2_70 efficiently on the following turn.

2025-12-31 17:03:30.555 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 9 points (just bought L3_74) and need 6 more to reach 15. My win condition is clear: purchase reserved L3_80 for 4 points (cost BLACK:7, net cost BLACK:4 after my BLACK:3 bonus), then claim noble N10 for 3 points (need WHITE:1, RED:2 more). I currently have BLACK:1 token and need 3 more BLACK tokens.

Strategic evaluation: I must collect BLACK tokens while blocking opponent's path. The opponent (3 points) has L2_70 reserved needing RED:3 net and only GOLD:1 token. RED is scarce and critical to them. The board has WHITE:2, RED:4, BLACK:3 available.

Key decision factors:
1. **BLACK collection**: I need 3 more BLACK tokens. I cannot take 2 BLACK this turn (need 4+ available), so I must take 1 BLACK.
2. **Opponent blocking**: Taking RED denies opponent access to their primary resource for L2_70.
3. **Noble progression**: Taking WHITE gives me WHITE:3, completing N10's WHITE requirement, leaving only RED:2 needed for the noble.
4. **Efficiency**: Taking RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1 advances all my goals simultaneously while blocking opponent.
5. **Token management**: I'm at 3 tokens; taking 3 gives me 6 total, well under the 10-token limit with no returns needed.

Alternative options:
- Taking 2 RED would stronger block opponent but delays my own win by a turn.
- Taking other color combinations wastes precious slots on colors I don't need (BLUE/GREEN).
- Reserving a card wastes a turn when I should be actively collecting BLACK.

This move positions me to buy L3_80 in 2 more turns (collecting 1 BLACK each turn) while preventing opponent from scoring, maintaining my decisive lead.

2025-12-31 17:04:51.595 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My previous plan identified the need for 2 Red tokens to purchase the reserved L2_70 (Cost 6 Red). I currently have 3 Red bonuses and 1 Gold token, requiring 2 more Red value. I anticipated taking 2 Red tokens this turn, but the board only possesses 3 Red tokens, making the 'Take 2' action illegal (requires 4+ available). Consequently, I must switch to taking 3 different tokens. I will take one Red token (essential for L2_70), one Black token, and one Blue token. Taking the Black token is strategically valuable as my opponent has reserved a card costing 7 Black (L3_80) and needs Black tokens; reducing the supply from 2 to 1 forces them to spend more turns collecting or reserving for gold. This move advances my resources towards L2_70 (reaching 5/6 Red value) while disrupting the opponent's engine.

2025-12-31 17:04:51.597 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Turn 21 - Player 1's move
2025-12-31 17:04:51.597 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=5, RED=2, BLK=5}
2025-12-31 17:11:45.280 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current situation: I have 9 points and need 6 more to win. My path is clear: buy reserved L3_80 (4 points) and claim noble N10 (3 points) for a total of 16 points.

Token requirements analysis:
- L3_80 costs BLACK:7, but with my BLACK:3 bonus, I need BLACK:4 net tokens. I currently have BLACK:2 tokens, so I need BLACK:2 more equivalents.
- N10 requires WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3. With my bonuses (WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:3) plus the WHITE:1 bonus I'll get from L3_80, I'll need RED:2 tokens total.

Current tokens: WHITE:3, RED:1, BLACK:2 (6 total)
Board availability: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

Strategic decision: Taking RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 is optimal because:
1. **Completes RED requirement**: Taking RED:1 gives me RED:2 total, exactly what I need for N10.
2. **Secures critical BLACK**: BLACK:1 is extremely scarce (only 1 available), and taking it combined with GOLD:1 gives me the BLACK:2 equivalents I need.
3. **Enables next-turn victory**: After this move, I'll have BLACK:3 tokens + GOLD:1 = BLACK:4 equivalent, enough to buy L3_80 next turn. I'll also have RED:2 tokens ready for N10.
4. **Blocks opponent**: Opponent needs RED:2 more for their reserved L2_70 (needs RED:3 net). Taking RED:1 denies them scarce RED. Taking BLACK:1 also blocks their potential N5 noble path.
5. **Token efficiency**: Increases from 6 to 9 tokens, well under the 10-token limit with no returns needed.
6. **GOLD flexibility**: Taking GOLD:1 directly is better than reserving a card for gold, since GOLD:4 is readily available and I avoid wasting a turn.

Next turn plan: Purchase L3_80 using BLACK:3 tokens + GOLD:1, then immediately claim N10 using RED:2 tokens, reaching 16 points and winning the game.

This move denies opponent resources while positioning me for a definitive victory in just 2 more actions.

2025-12-31 17:11:45.280 [main] WARN  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
2025-12-31 17:21:10.468 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 9 points and 6 tokens (WHITE:3, RED:1, BLACK:2). My reserved L3_80 costs BLACK:7, net cost BLACK:4 after my BLACK:3 bonus. I have BLACK:2 tokens, needing 2 more BLACK. For noble N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3), I need RED:2 tokens (have RED:1 bonus, need RED:2 total, currently have RED:1). 

Strategic evaluation: Taking WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 is optimal because:
1. **Direct progress**: RED:1 gets me halfway to the RED:2 I need for N10; BLACK:1 gets me halfway to the BLACK:2 I need for L3_80
2. **Opponent blocking**: Opponent needs WHITE:1 for N10 (they have WHITE:0 tokens, bonus WHITE:2), RED:1 for N10/N5/N2, and BLACK:2 for N5/N10. Taking all three colors simultaneously blocks all their noble paths
3. **Board availability**: WHITE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 are all available on the board. Taking WHITE:1 removes the last white token, preventing opponent from claiming N10
4. **Token efficiency**: Moving from 6 to 9 tokens, well under the 10-token limit with no returns needed
5. **Maintains flexibility**: After this move I'll have WHITE:4, RED:2, BLACK:3, positioning me to take BLACK:1 next turn and purchase L3_80, then collect the final RED:1 for N10

Alternative options are inferior: Taking GREEN or BLUE would waste slots on colors I don't need while failing to block opponent's WHITE requirement for N10; taking only 2 tokens is illegal; reserving a card would waste a turn when I should be actively collecting resources.

This is the most efficient move toward victory while denying opponent's scoring path.

2025-12-31 17:22:12.338 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My immediate priority is to purchase the reserved card L2_70 (3 Prestige Points, Red bonus), which costs 6 Red. I currently hold 3 Red bonuses, 1 Red token, and 1 Gold token, totaling 5 Red value. I require exactly 1 more Red unit to complete the purchase. The board contains 1 Red token. To secure this essential resource and prevent my opponent from taking it (potentially blocking me), I must take tokens this turn. I will take 1 Red, 1 Blue, and 1 Green token (as required by the 'take 3 different' rule when available). This action brings my total Red purchasing power to 6 (3 bonuses + 2 tokens + 1 gold), allowing me to buy L2_70 on the very next turn. This purchase is the keystone for my strategy, as the 4th Red bonus facilitates a subsequent rapid acquisition of 'free' Green cards on the board to trigger Noble N2.

2025-12-31 17:31:48.070 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I cannot take tokens because only BLUE:2 and GREEN:3 are available (need 3 different colors or 4+ of one color). I also cannot purchase L3_80 because I'm short BLACK:1. My optimal play is to reserve L2_68 to get GOLD:1, which serves as the missing BLACK token for L3_80. Reserving L2_68 also blocks my opponent from acquiring a RED bonus card they might want. After this reserve, I'll have WHITE:4, RED:2, BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (10 tokens). Next turn I can immediately purchase L3_80 using BLACK:3 + GOLD:1 to reach 13 points. I'll then have exactly WHITE:4, RED:2 tokens left, which is precisely what I need to claim noble N10 (need WHITE:1, RED:2) for 3 more points, reaching 16 total and winning the game. This is the fastest path to victory while blocking opponent's potential RED strategy.

This purchase is the optimal move for several reasons: 1) It immediately awards 3 Prestige Points, doubling my score to 6. 2) It provides the 4th Red bonus required for my Noble strategy. 3) Most importantly, acquiring the 4th Red bonus creates a perfect synergy with the board: I already possess 1 Green and 2 Black bonuses, meaning that once I have 4 Red bonuses, the Level 2 card L2_55 (2 Prestige Points, White bonus, Cost: 1 Green, 4 Red, 2 Black) will become completely free (0 tokens) to purchase on a future turn. This sets up a powerful chain reaction.

2025-12-31 17:36:14.318 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will purchase the Level 2 card L2_55 (2 Prestige Points, White bonus). This card costs 1 Green, 4 Red, and 2 Black. My current bonuses (1 Green, 4 Red, 2 Black) completely cover this cost, making the purchase effectively free (0 tokens required). This is the optimal move for several reasons: 1) It immediately advances my score to 8 VP. 2) It increases my White bonus count to 3, which satisfies the White requirement for Noble N10 (requires 3 White, 3 Red, 3 Black). Since I already meet the Red requirement, I only need one more Black bonus to trigger this 3 VP Noble. 3) By not spending any tokens, I preserve my resources (2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Black) to potentially acquire the available 'free' Green cards on subsequent turns to trigger Noble N2 (4 Green, 4 Red). This move maximizes point velocity while building toward multiple Noble conditions.

At turn end, I will claim N10 for 3 points, reaching 16 total and winning immediately. While victory is certain, I should optimize my token selection to block opponent's progress. The opponent (8 points) critically needs BLACK tokens for both N5 and N10 nobles, and GREEN tokens for N2. Taking BLACK:1 directly blocks their most important resource, while taking GREEN:1 blocks their N2 path and BLUE:1 blocks potential card purchases. This combination maximizes disruption while maintaining my N10 qualification. No token returns are needed as I'll have 9 total tokens after this action.

2025-12-31 17:46:12.483 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My current score is 8. The opponent is at 13 and threatening to win on their next turn by acquiring their reserved card L2_68, which requires 1 more Black resource. I cannot fully block their access to Black tokens (2 available, I can take 1). Therefore, my best strategy is to maximize my score as quickly as possible. The Level 3 card L3_79 (3 Prestige Points) is reachable on the next turn. It costs 3 Blue, 3 Green, 5 Red, 3 Black. My current bonuses (W3, U1, G1, R4, K2) reduce the cost to 2 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red, 1 Black. I currently hold 2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Black tokens. I am missing exactly 1 Green and 1 Red token. I will take 1 Green, 1 Red, and 1 Black token (defensively lowering the Black supply). This sets me up to purchase L3_79 on Turn 26 for a total of 11 points.

At turn end, I will claim N10 for 3 points, reaching 16 total and winning immediately. The opponent (8 points) already qualifies for nobles N5 and N10 but hasn't claimed them yet. Their win condition would be claiming a noble (3 points) + buying a 4+ point card. They cannot afford any 4+ point cards currently (need WHITE tokens which aren't available), so they're setting up for future turns. I should block their most critical resources: GREEN (they need 1 more for N2) and RED (they need 1 more for their reserved L2_70). Taking BLACK also blocks their purchase options. Since I have 9 tokens, taking 3 forces me to return 2. I'll return WHITE and BLACK since I don't need them for N10 payment. This blocks opponent's GREEN/RED/BLACK while positioning me to pay RED:2 from my RED:3 tokens for the noble.

Since I'm at the 10-token limit, I cannot take more tokens. The optimal move is to purchase a free Level 1 card to maintain my token situation and secure victory. Card L1_25 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, but with my bonuses (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3) the net cost is zero tokens. Purchasing this card maintains my RED:3 token count, preserving my N10 qualification. This is the simplest path to victory while blocking a GREEN bonus card from my opponent. After this purchase, I will claim noble N10 and win the game.

2025-12-31 18:07:57.680 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My score is 11. The opponent is at 13 and will likely win in 2 turns (Turns 27, 29) by acquiring Black tokens to buy L2_68. I cannot effectively block their acquisition of tokens. I must race to 15 points. I need 4 points. No visible card allows me to reach 15 points in 1-2 turns. My best chance is to blindly reserve a Level 2 card. If I draw a card with a Black bonus that is worth at least 1 Prestige Point, I can purchase it next turn (using my strong White/Red/Black engine and Gold) to reach 12+ points and trigger Noble N10 (requires 3 Black bonuses, I have 2) for an additional 3 points, totaling 15+. This ~20% gamble is my only winning line.

2025-12-31 18:08:32.806 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state: I have 13 points and qualify for noble N10 RIGHT NOW. With bonuses WHITE:3, RED:1, BLACK:3 and tokens WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:0, I meet N10's requirements (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3). I need RED:2 from tokens (I have RED:3), so I will claim N10 at turn end for 3 points, reaching 16 total and winning immediately. Since I'm at the 10-token limit, I cannot take more tokens. The optimal move is to purchase Level 1 card L1_29 which costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1. With my WHITE:3 bonus, the net cost is only BLUE:1. This efficient purchase gives me a GREEN bonus (increasing to GREEN:2), blocks this card from my opponent, and maintains my N10 qualification. After spending BLUE:1, my tokens will be WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, still allowing me to pay RED:2 for the noble. This is the best path to victory while improving my board position and denying resources to my opponent.

2025-12-31 18:14:55.699 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 13 points and need 2 more to win. My opponent has 11 points and has a clear path to victory: buy L2_47 (1 point) with GOLD:2 this turn, then take WHITE tokens to buy L3_76 (4 points) for a total of 16 points. I currently cannot afford any point-scoring cards. The most critical move is blocking opponent's WHITE token access, as L3_76 requires WHITE:3 net cost and they need WHITE tokens to purchase it. Taking WHITE:1 directly blocks this path. I also take BLUE:1 and BLACK:1 to progress toward my own purchases (L2_66 needs BLUE:3, L2_68 needs BLACK:2) while forcing me to return only 1 token. Returning GREEN:1 is optimal since I have GREEN:2 and my GREEN:2 bonus already covers most of my needs. This blocks the opponent's fastest win condition while maintaining my N10 noble path (need RED:2 more in bonuses, which I can get from L2_68 or L2_66 in future turns).

I cannot purchase it this turn. The opponent is at 13 points and threatens to win on their next turn or the one after by acquiring their reserved L2_68 (needs 1 more Black resource). Optimizing for the tie-breaker (fewest cards) and speed, the best line is to reserve a card now to gain a 3rd Gold token, then purchase L3_76 next turn (T30) for 15 points total. I will reserve L1_1 specifically because it provides a Black bonus; taking it off the board denies the opponent an alternative way to gain the Black strength they need for their winning card.

Since I'm at the 10-token limit, I cannot take more tokens. The optimal move is to purchase an affordable Level 1 card to maintain my token position and block opponent. Card L1_33 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. After applying my bonuses (WHITE:3, GREEN:2, BLACK:3), the net cost is only BLUE:1. I have exactly BLUE:1 token, so I pay that single token. This purchase gives me a RED bonus (increasing to RED:2), blocks this card from my opponent, and leaves me with tokens WHITE:4, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1 - still more than enough to pay RED:2 for the noble. After purchase, I claim N10 and win with 16 points. This is the simplest, safest path to victory while denying a RED-bonus card to my opponent.

2025-12-31 18:18:39.920 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 11 points and need 4 more to reach the 15-point victory condition. I hold the reserved card L3_76, which is worth 4 Prestige Points. Its cost is 7 White. My current resources are 4 White bonuses and 3 Gold tokens, totaling 7 White equivalent. By purchasing this card immediately, my score rises to 15. As I am Player 0 starting the round, the opponent (Player 1, 13 points) will get one final turn. The opponent needs 1 more Black resource to purchase their reserved winning card (L2_68). They cannot take a token and purchase a card in the same turn. Consequently, they cannot overtake my score of 15 in their remaining action. This purchase guarantees a win.
