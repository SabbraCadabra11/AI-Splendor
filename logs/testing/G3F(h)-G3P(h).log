Several valuable cards (L1_40 for 1 point, L2_58 for 3 points) and Level 3 cards (L3_78, L3_86) require WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN tokens. Additionally, all three available Nobles (N8, N4, N9) require combinations of WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN. I will take one of each to maintain flexibility and build towards these targets efficiently.

My primary short-term goal is to purchase card L1_5 (Black gem, costs 2 Green, 1 Red). I need Green and Red tokens for this purchase. Additionally, Green and Blue are the most valuable colors for the available Nobles (N4, N8, N9), so accumulating them early is strategic. I am not prioritizing White or Black immediately, as the opponent has a head start on the card L1_33 which requires all colors, and L1_5 is a cheaper alternative for an initial gem.

This strategy starts building my engine while maintaining flexibility based on what my opponent does. I have checked that the board has sufficient tokens (GREEN: 2, RED: 3, BLACK: 4) and that my total tokens will remain below the limit of 10.

2025-12-28 00:06:06.168 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My opponent (Player 0) has accumulated enough tokens to purchase either card L1_5 (Black gem, costs 2 Green, 1 Red) or L1_33 (Red gem, costs 1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Black) on their next turn. To remain competitive, I must position myself to purchase whichever card they do not take, or the better of the two if they take neither. Currently, I possess 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. To afford L1_33, I need a White and a Black token. To afford L1_5, I need one more Green token. By taking White, Black, and Green tokens this turn, I will finish with 1 White, 1 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red, and 1 Black. This specific combination grants me the flexibility to purchase either L1_5 or L1_33 on my next turn, effectively guaranteeing me a development card regardless of the opponent's action. I choose Green specifically because it is the only color with 1 token remaining on the board, and securing it is necessary for the L1_5 option.

2025-12-28 00:07:31.099 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take White, Blue, and Green tokens. Currently, I have enough tokens to purchase L1_5, but doing so would deplete my Green and Red tokens, leaving me with few resources. By taking tokens instead, I achieve three strategic goals: 1) I secure the last available Green token on the board, temporarily blocking my opponent (who needs 1 more Green to buy L1_5). 2) I reach 3 Green tokens, allowing me to purchase L1_7 (Black gem, costs 3 Green) on my next turn without spending my Red token, which is useful given the scarcity of Red on the board. 3) I accumulate White and Blue tokens, which are essential for the available Nobles (N8, N4) and future card purchases like L1_40 or L2_54. This move strengthens my economy while disrupting the opponent.

Taking RED tokens helps me work towards L2_57, which provides 2 prestige points for 5 RED. WHITE is needed for L1_40 (1 point) and various Tier 2 cards, and BLACK is a requirement for L1_36 and L2_66. This allows me to accumulate resources for prestige-point-generating cards while I wait for GREEN tokens to replenish.

I can afford both available Black gem cards: L1_5 (costs 2 Green, 1 Red) and L1_7 (costs 3 Green). Strategic analysis favors purchasing L1_5. First, my opponent has 1 Green token and a Red bonus, leaving them exactly 1 Green token short of affording L1_5. Since there are 0 Green tokens in the bank, they are currently blocked. If I purchase L1_7, I would return 3 Green tokens to the bank, allowing the opponent to acquire the necessary Green to buy L1_5. By purchasing L1_5 myself, I secure the card and deny it to them. Furthermore, this leaves L1_7 (cost 3 Green) on the board; even after I return 2 Green tokens from my purchase, the opponent will only be able to reach 2 Green tokens next turn, leaving L1_7 still out of their immediate reach. This move optimizes my engine building while disrupting the opponent's efficiency.

2025-12-28 00:08:45.479 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 2 RED tokens and 1 RED bonus, providing 3 RED purchasing power. Card L2_57 (2 points) requires 5 RED, and the N9 Noble requires 3 RED, 3 GREEN, and 3 BLUE bonuses. Since there are only 2 RED tokens on the board, I cannot take two RED tokens at once. Instead, I will take one BLUE, one GREEN, and one RED token. This increases my RED power to 4 (bringing me within one token of L2_57), while also collecting the BLUE and GREEN resources necessary for the level 2 cards (like L2_54 or L2_66) and the high-value Nobles. This move keeps me under the 10-token limit (totaling 8 tokens) and sets up multiple paths for prestige points.

2025-12-28 00:09:31.022 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take White, Blue, and Green tokens. Currently, there is exactly 1 token available for each of these colors on the board, so taking them depletes the supply, severely restricting the opponent's options. Strategically, this move serves three purposes: 1) It gives me the 3rd White token needed to purchase L1_39 (Red gem, cost 3 White) on my next turn. 2) It secures the last Green token, blocking the opponent who has 2 Green tokens and needs one more for L1_7. 3) It brings my holdings to 3 White and 3 Blue, putting me just one Green token away from satisfying the requirements for Noble N8 (3 White, 3 Blue, 3 Green). This is a strong tempo play that advances my economy while disrupting the opponent.

Card L2_57, which grants 2 prestige points, requires 5 RED. Currently, the board only has 1 RED and 2 BLACK tokens available, and zero WHITE, BLUE, or GREEN tokens.

2025-12-28 00:11:37.746 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I possess 9 tokens (3 White, 3 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Black) and cannot 'Take Tokens' because the board lacks 3 different colors or 4 of a single color. My options are to Purchase or Reserve. I can afford L1_39 (Red gem, cost 3 White), but L1_40 (Red gem, cost 4 White, 1 Prestige Point) is a superior option available on the board. Although I lack the 4th White token, I can Reserve L1_40 to acquire a Gold token. This brings my total to 10 tokens (3W, 3B, 2G, 1K, 1G). On my next turn, I will use the 3 White tokens and 1 Gold token to purchase L1_40. This play is highly efficient, converting my White tokens into a Prestige Point and a necessary Red bonus (I currently have 0 Red) for only the cost of one extra turn compared to buying L1_39.

I currently hold 10 tokens, preventing me from taking more, so purchasing is necessary. I possess 3 White tokens and 1 Gold token, which exactly satisfies the 4 White cost of L1_40. This move is optimal for several reasons: 1) It secures my first Prestige Point immediately. 2) It grants me a Red bonus, a color I currently lack, which helps diversify my engine for future Tier 2 purchases and Noble N9. 3) It reduces my token count from 10 to 6, freeing up space to collect tokens in subsequent turns. While spending the tokens returns White to the bank (potentially helping the opponent), the value of gaining a point and a key bonus outweighs defensive stalling.

2025-12-28 00:13:54.059 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take White, Red, and Black tokens. Analysis of the board shows I am ideally positioned to purchase L2_66 (1 Prestige Point, Red bonus, cost 3 Blue, 2 Red, 3 Black) on my next turn. Currently, I hold 3 Blue tokens, 1 Black token, 1 Red bonus, and 1 Black bonus. To afford the card, I need 1 additional Red token (to reach 2 Red total with bonus) and 1 additional Black token (to reach 3 Black total with bonus). The board has exactly 1 Black token and adequate Red tokens available. Taking these specific tokens fills my resource gap precisely. Additionally, taking the last available Black token denies it to the opponent, who holds 2 Black tokens and may need a third. The White token is taken to satisfy the '3 different colors' rule and build capital for future White-cost cards like L2_49 or L2_54. This move brings my total to 9 tokens, avoiding the discard limit.

2025-12-28 00:14:06.772 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 2 WHITE tokens and a WHITE bonus from card L2_57, giving me a total of 3 WHITE purchasing power. This is exactly enough to purchase L1_39. Buying this card increases my RED bonus count to 2, which helps me toward higher-tier cards like L2_66 or L2_54, and brings me closer to the N9 Noble. Since the board currently only has 3 tokens total (1 WHITE, 2 RED), taking tokens is not a valid action this turn because I cannot take 3 different colors or 2 of the same (as there are fewer than 4 RED available). Purchasing L1_39 is an efficient move that improves my engine while staying well within the token limit.

My current resources are perfectly aligned for this transaction: I hold 3 Blue tokens, 1 Red token (plus 1 Red bonus makes 2), and 2 Black tokens (plus 1 Black bonus makes 3). This move is optimal because it secures an immediate Prestige Point and adds a second Red bonus to my engine, moving me closer to the requirement for Noble N9 (3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue). Furthermore, I am currently holding 9 tokens; purchasing this card allows me to spend 6 tokens (3 Blue, 1 Red, 2 Black), clearing my hand to 3 tokens (1 White, 2 Green) and avoiding the 10-token limit while cycling tokens back to the board.

I currently have a WHITE bonus and 2 RED bonuses. My primary target is L2_54 (1 prestige point, WHITE bonus), which costs 2 WHITE, 3 BLUE, and 3 RED. By taking WHITE and BLUE tokens, I will have 2 WHITE power (1 bonus + 1 token) and 2 BLUE power (2 tokens), putting me only one BLUE token away from that purchase. Additionally, taking a BLACK token brings my BLACK total to 3, making L1_32 (1 prestige point, GREEN bonus) affordable on a future turn. This move is efficient and keeps my total token count at 9, safely below the 10-token limit.

2025-12-28 00:16:35.985 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will reserve card L1_12 (Blue gem). My strategy focuses on acquiring Noble N9 (requires 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue), for which I currently lack Blue and Green bonuses. L1_12 provides a critical Blue gem. Its cost is 1 Blue, 3 Green, 1 Red. With my existing 2 Red bonuses, the effective cost is 1 Blue and 3 Green. I possess 2 Green tokens, but since the board has 0 Green tokens available, I cannot acquire the third required Green token via standard 'Take Tokens'. Reserving grants me a Gold token (acting as the missing Green) and secures this scarce Blue generator before my opponent—who also holds 2 Green tokens and competes for similar colors—can claim it. In subsequent turns, I will gather the necessary Blue token to finalize the purchase.

2025-12-28 00:18:25.668 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary goal is to purchase the reserved card L1_12 (Blue gem), which is essential for the Blue bonus required for Noble N9. The card costs 1 Blue, 3 Green, and 1 Red. My 2 Red bonuses cover the Red cost entirely. I currently hold 2 Green tokens and 1 Gold. To purchase this card efficiently without spending my Gold token (saving it for later flexibility), I need exactly 1 Blue token and 1 additional Green token. The board has 1 Blue and 2 Green tokens available. I will take 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 White token. Taking the White token is optimal because I currently have 0 White bonuses, and it positions me to afford White-cost cards like L2_54 in the future. Furthermore, by taking the last available Blue and White tokens, I significantly deplete the board's diversity. This move brings my total to 7 tokens, allowing me to start my next turn by purchasing L1_12 with 1 Blue and 3 Green tokens.

2025-12-28 00:18:53.948 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have sufficient resources to purchase L2_54, which grants 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus.

My current purchasing power includes a WHITE bonus and 2 WHITE tokens (3 WHITE power), 3 BLUE tokens (3 BLUE power), and 2 RED bonuses and 1 RED token (3 RED power).

2025-12-28 00:19:29.180 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will purchase the reserved card L1_12 (Bonus: Blue). This completes the plan initiated two turns ago. The card costs 1 Blue, 3 Green, and 1 Red. With my current resources (1 Blue token, 3 Green tokens, and 2 Red bonuses), I can afford the purchase exactly without using my Gold token. My 2 Red bonuses satisfy the 1 Red cost, and I pay the remaining 1 Blue and 3 Green tokens. This move is optimal because it adds a Blue bonus to my tableau—my first of this color—which is a critical requirement for Noble N9 (needs 3 Blue, 3 Green, 3 Red) and opens up future Blue-cost purchases. Additionally, spending 4 tokens reduces my hand size from 7 to 3, giving me ample room to collect new tokens in subsequent turns. While this returns Green tokens to the board, advancing my own engine by securing a necessary color is the priority.

Purchasing this card immediately increases my score to 4 and provides my first GREEN bonus, which is essential for working toward any of the available Nobles (N8, N4, and N9 all require GREEN). This move is efficient as it converts my high concentration of BLACK tokens into a point and a permanent resource, freeing up space in my inventory for other colors like WHITE and RED needed for higher-tier cards like L2_58 or L2_70.

2025-12-28 00:20:46.287 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My strategic focus is on purchasing L2_70 (3 Prestige Points, Red Bonus). This card is highly valuable as it provides significant points and grants the third Red bonus needed for Noble N9 (requires 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue). The card costs 6 Red. With my current 2 Red bonuses, the effective cost is 4 Red tokens. I currently hold 1 Gold token, meaning I need to acquire 3 Red tokens. The board currently has 4 Red tokens available, which allows me to use the 'Take 2' action. Taking 2 Red tokens now allows me to gather resources faster than taking 1 of each color and denies the opponent (who also holds 2 Red bonuses) the opportunity to take 2 Red tokens on their turn. In the next turn, I will secure the final requisite Red token to complete the purchase.

2025-12-28 00:23:39.535 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK token, which are all currently available on the board. This move will bring my total token count to 10, the maximum allowed. The primary objective is to purchase card L2_48 (1 prestige point, BLUE bonus) on my next turn. L2_48 costs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, and 3 BLACK. By taking these tokens, I will have 3 BLUE tokens, 2 GREEN tokens (plus 1 GREEN bonus), and 3 BLACK tokens, satisfying the cost requirements. This action is the most efficient choice because it secures a point-scoring card and develops a BLUE bonus, which is necessary for claiming any of the three available Nobles (N8, N4, N9). Since there are no WHITE tokens available on the board to advance toward L2_58 or L2_49, concentrating on the available GREEN and BLACK resources to secure L2_48 is the optimal strategy.

2025-12-28 00:24:55.228 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary objective is to acquire Blue and Green bonuses to satisfy the requirements for Noble N9 (3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue). I currently have 3 Red and 1 Blue bonus. L2_48 (1 Prestige Point, Blue Bonus) is visible on the board and is a perfect target for my deck. Crucially, my opponent (Player 0) is currently at the 10-token limit and possesses the exact resources (3 Blue tokens, 2 Green tokens + 1 Bonus, 3 Black tokens) to purchase this card (Cost: 2 Blue, 3 Green, 3 Black) on their next turn. If they buy it, I lose a vital Blue bonus source, and they gain points. By reserving L2_48 now, I deny them this optimal move, secure the card for myself, and gain a Gold token (taking me to 5 total tokens). Although the board is low on Green/Black tokens needed to pay for it, the opponent will be forced to spend tokens on a different card soon, likely replenishing the board's supply for my future turns.

Card L2_49 (2 prestige points, BLUE bonus) is a strong target. It costs 5 WHITE and 3 BLUE. My current resources provide 4 WHITE power (2 bonus and 2 tokens) and 3 BLUE tokens.

This move is highly efficient as it secures a high-value card, overcomes the current board shortage of WHITE tokens, and manages my token limit productively. I will return one BLACK token to stay at the 10-token maximum.

This card costs 2 Blue, 2 Green, and 3 Red. My current bonuses (1 Blue, 3 Red) reduce the cost to 1 Blue and 2 Green. I possess 1 Blue token, 1 Green token, and 1 Gold token, which allows me to pay the remaining cost exactly (using the Gold token to cover the second Green requirement). This move is optimal for several reasons: it increases my score to 6; it secures a second Blue bonus, which is a key requirement for Noble N9 (needs 3 Blue, 3 Green, 3 Red); and it removes a card from the board that the opponent can currently afford. After this purchase, I will have 2 White tokens remaining, but the permanent Blue bonus helps pave the way for my reserved card L2_48.

2025-12-28 00:27:42.538 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary goal is to acquire Noble N9 (requires 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue). I currently have 3 Red and 2 Blue bonuses (counting my reserved L2_48 which provides the 3rd Blue). My reserved L2_48 costs 2 Blue, 3 Green, and 3 Black. With my current bonuses (2 Blue, 1 Black), the cost is reduced to 3 Green and 2 Black tokens. I possess 2 White tokens which are not useful for this specific cost. However, I can purchase L1_3 (Black Bonus) immediately. Its cost is 2 White, 2 Blue, 1 Red. My bonuses cover the Blue and Red costs entirely, and my 2 White tokens cover the rest. Buying L1_3 grants me a second Black bonus, which further reduces the cost of my reserved L2_48 to 3 Green and 1 Black token. This move efficiently converts my idle White tokens into a permanent discount for my target card.

2025-12-28 00:29:32.978 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 0 tokens and need to progress towards my reserved card L2_48 (Blue Bonus, needed for Noble N9). L2_48 requires 3 Green tokens (after bonuses), but the board only contains 2 Green tokens, preventing a direct purchase. I can, however, purchase L1_28 (Green Bonus), which costs 1 White, 3 Blue, and 1 Green. My 2 Blue bonuses reduce the cost to 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green. This purchase will provide a permanent Green bonus, advancing my Noble N9 goal (needs 3 Green) and reducing the cost of L2_48. Therefore, I will take 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green token to acquire the exact resources needed to satisfy the remaining cost of L1_28 next turn.

2025-12-28 00:30:23.831 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN token from the board. This is a highly strategic move as it advances me toward several prestige-point cards while simultaneously blocking my opponent. Taking the only available WHITE token brings me to 3 tokens (plus 2 bonuses), meaning I only need 1 more WHITE to purchase the 3-point L2_58 card. Similarly, taking a GREEN token brings me to 3 tokens (plus 1 bonus), putting me just one away from the 2-point L2_63 card. Additionally, by taking the only GREEN token on the board, I prevent my opponent from acquiring the resources they need to complete their reserved L2_48 card, which requires 3 GREEN. This move is efficient, maintains my token count at 9 (one below the limit), and balances engine development with point acquisition.

2025-12-28 00:31:00.468 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will execute the plan formulated on the previous turn and purchase L1_28 (Green Bonus). The card costs 1 White, 3 Blue, and 1 Green. My 2 Blue bonuses reduce the cost to 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green. I currently possess exactly 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green token, allowing me to pay for this card perfectly. This purchase is critical strategically because it provides my first Green bonus. I need 3 Green bonuses for Noble N9 (current progress: 3 Red, 2 Blue, 0 Green), and this Green bonus will further reduce the cost of my reserved card L2_48 (which requires Green tokens). Since the board currently has 0 Green tokens available, acquiring Green bonuses is the most reliable way to afford my reserved card.

2025-12-28 00:31:48.458 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will take 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN token from the board. This move is specifically calculated to acquire the remaining tokens needed for two high-prestige cards: L2_58 (3 points) and L2_63 (2 points). I currently have 3 WHITE tokens and 2 WHITE bonuses, so taking the 1 WHITE token available will give me the 6 total power required to purchase L2_58 on my next turn. Similarly, I currently have 3 GREEN tokens and 1 GREEN bonus, so taking the 1 GREEN token available will provide the 5 total power required for L2_63 shortly thereafter. This action also serves as a strategic block, as I am taking the only available WHITE and GREEN tokens, which prevents my opponent from using them to advance their own engine or complete their reserved L2_48 card. Since this will bring my total token count to 12, I will return 1 BLUE and 1 BLACK token to stay at the 10-token limit while preserving the resources necessary for my immediate point-scoring goals.

2025-12-28 00:33:10.253 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My immediate goal is to purchase reserved card L2_48 (Blue Bonus) to secure the final Blue bonus needed for Noble N9 (3R, 3G, 3B). My current bonuses reduce L2_48's cost to 2 Green and 1 Black token. The board has 0 Green tokens, creating a bottleneck. However, the opponent (Player 0) has 4 Green tokens and 4 White tokens. They can currently afford L2_58 (3 Prestige Points, Cost 6 White) using their 2 White bonuses and 4 tokens. This is a high-value move for them. If they take it, they score 3 points and hoard their Green tokens. By reserving L2_58 now, I accomplish three things: 1) Deny the opponent 3 points, 2) Gain a Gold token to serve as one of the missing resources (Green/Black) for L2_48, and 3) Incentivize the opponent to purchase L2_63 (Cost 5 Green) instead, which forces them to return their Green tokens to the board, allowing me to take them on a subsequent turn.

This card costs 5 GREEN. My current resources include 4 GREEN tokens and 1 GREEN bonus, making it affordable without needing any other tokens or gold. This purchase is a direct continuation of my long-term strategy to reach 15 points, bringing my total score to 8. It also helps manage my token limit, as I am currently at 10 tokens; by spending 4 tokens, I reduce my count to 6, creating space to collect the RED and BLACK tokens I will need for future high-point cards. Furthermore, the additional GREEN bonus brings me closer to the requirements for all three nobles (N8, N4, and N9), which are crucial for securing a late-game victory.

2025-12-28 00:35:26.947 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will reserve the L3_78 card, which grants 5 prestige points and a BLUE bonus. This is a critical move toward reaching the 15-point goal, as it brings my potential score to 13. Currently, I have 4 WHITE tokens and 2 WHITE bonuses (total Power 6), but I need 7 Power in WHITE to purchase this card. Since there are 0 WHITE tokens available on the board, reserving L3_78 allows me to acquire a GOLD token, which will serve as the necessary 5th WHITE token. Additionally, I need 1 more BLUE token to satisfy the card's cost (3 BLUE required; I have 1 bonus and 1 token). This reservation secures a high-value card from my opponent and provides the flexible resource required to complete the purchase in a subsequent turn, all while keeping my token count at 7, well within the 10-token limit.

2025-12-28 00:36:03.591 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I will execute the planned purchase of my reserved card L2_48 (1 Prestige Point, Blue Bonus). The base cost is 2 Blue, 3 Green, and 3 Black. My current bonuses (2 Blue, 1 Green, 2 Black) reduce the required payment to 2 Green and 1 Black. I currently possess 1 Green, 1 Black, and 1 Gold token. I will use the Green and Black tokens alongside the Gold token (acting as the second Green) to pay the cost exactly. This move is strategically vital as it provides my 3rd Blue bonus, satisfying the Blue requirement for Noble N9 (Needs 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue). After this, I successfully have 3 Red and 3 Blue bonuses, needing only 2 more Green bonuses to claim the Noble.

The card costs 7 WHITE and 3 BLUE power. My current resources include 6 WHITE power (4 tokens + 2 bonuses) and 2 BLUE power (1 token + 1 bonus). I also hold 1 GOLD token. By taking 1 BLUE token this turn, I will have the 3 BLUE power required. I can then use my GOLD token as the 7th WHITE power in the next turn. I am also taking GREEN and BLACK tokens to maximize my resource collection and build toward my final 2 points (likely through a card like L2_68 or a noble). This move brings my total token count to exactly 10, meaning I do not need to return any tokens.

2025-12-28 00:37:53.674 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My primary objective is to secure the 3rd Green bonus required for Noble N9 (needs 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue; I have 3 Red, 1 Green, 3 Blue) and accumulate prestige points. Card L2_62 (2 Prestige Points, Green Bonus) is the perfect target. It costs 5 Blue and 3 Green. With my bonuses (3 Blue, 1 Green), the remaining cost is 2 Blue and 2 Green. 

Crucially, the opponent (Player 0) is poised to purchase this exact card. They require 4 Blue and 1 Green token (after their bonuses). They currently possess 2 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Gold token. The board has exactly 1 Blue token available. If the opponent takes that Blue token on their turn, they will have sufficient resources (3 Blue + 1 Gold = 4 Blue; 1 Green) to buy L2_62 immediately. 

While taking the Blue token myself effectively blocks their purchase, it leaves the card on the board, vulnerable to being reserved by the opponent. Reserving L2_62 myself is the superior move: it guarantees I get the card, denies the opponent 2 points and a useful bonus, and provides me with a Gold token to help pay for it (reducing my need to 1 Blue and 2 Green tokens next). Strategies dictate securing contested key cards immediately.

They effectively need only 2 Red resources to purchase this card. Since there are 4 Red tokens on the board, the opponent can use the 'Take 2 Same' action to acquire 2 Red tokens on their next turn, enabling them to buy L2_55 on the following turn to reach 15 points. I must block this sequence immediately by reserving L2_55. This action denies the opponent the win and provides me with a Gold token, which will help fund my own reserved card L2_62 (Green Bonus) in future turns.

2025-12-28 00:41:03.979 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My opponent (Player 0) is at 14 points and is threatening an immediate win. They require only 1 point. Card L2_59 (1 Prestige Point, Green Bonus) is available on the board and costs 3 White, 2 Green, and 3 Red. The opponent has 3 White, 2 Green, and 2 Red bonuses, meaning they only need a single Red token to purchase this card and reach 15 points. To prevent their victory, I must remove L2_59 from the board by reserving it. However, currently, my reserved hand is full (3 cards), preventing me from reserving any new cards. I must first clear a slot by purchasing one of my reserved cards. L2_55 (2 Prestige Points, White Bonus) costs 1 Green, 4 Red, and 2 Black. My bonuses (1 Green, 3 Red, 2 Black) cover most of the cost, leaving a deficit of 1 Red. I possess 2 Gold tokens, so I can afford to buy L2_55 by paying 1 Gold token. This action improves my score to 9 and, crucially, opens a reserve slot, allowing me to attempt to reserve L2_59 on my next turn to block the opponent's win condition.

This move ensures I can win on the next turn by purchasing L2_59, which will bring my total score to 15.

2025-12-28 00:42:20.720 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: CRITICAL: The opponent (Player 0) sits at 14 Prestige Points. Card L2_59 (1 Prestige Point, Green Bonus) is currently available on the board. Its cost is 3 White, 2 Green, and 3 Red. The opponent possesses 3 White, 2 Green, and 2 Red bonuses, plus 1 Red token. This means they can purchase L2_59 immediately on their turn for the win (14 + 1 = 15). I MUST effectively remove this card from the board to prolong the game. Having cleared a reserve slot on my previous turn (currently holding 2 reserved cards), I will reserve L2_59 now. This move denies the opponent the victory and grants me a Gold token. Furthermore, L2_59 provides a Green bonus; combined with my other reserved card L2_62 (Green Bonus), this sets up the 2 Green bonuses I still lack to claim Noble N9 (3 PP) and reach 15 points myself (Current 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 15).

2025-12-28 00:44:25.572 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: CRITICAL SITUATION: The opponent (Player 0) is at 14 points and can win immediately on their next turn. They require 1 Prestige Point. Card L2_42 (1 PP) is on the board costing 3 White, 3 Green, 2 Black. The opponent has 3 White and 2 Green bonuses, reducing the cost to 1 Green and 2 Black. They currently possess exactly 1 Green and 2 Black tokens. They have the resources to buy it now. I MUST try to block this. However, my reserved hand is full (3 cards), so I cannot reserve L2_42. I also lack the resources to purchase L2_42 (I need 2 White and 2 Green beyond my 2 Gold). I also cannot purchase any of my reserved cards this turn to free a slot (I am short 1 token for the cheapest ones). 

Since I cannot legally prevent the opponent's potential win, I must play to maximize my own chances assuming the game continues (e.g., if the opponent makes a mistake). My path to 15 points requires purchasing my reserved cards L2_62 (2 PP, Green Bonus) and L2_59 (1 PP, Green Bonus) which will also secure Noble N9 (3 PP). To afford L2_62 (Cost: 5 Blue, 3 Green; Bonuses: 3 Blue, 1 Green; Need: 2 Blue, 2 Green), I need more tokens. Currently, I have 1 Blue and 2 Gold. Taking White, Blue, and Green tokens will give me the resources to purchase L2_62 next turn (using 2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Gold). This is the optimal move for my own victory condition.
