Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: As the first player in Splendor, my goal is to start building an engine that will let me buy high-value cards efficiently. Since I have no tokens, bonuses, or cards, I should take tokens to position myself for early purchases. The most effective opening is often taking 3 different colors to maximize flexibility. Looking at the face-up cards, several Level 1 cards require combinations of WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED, and BLACK. For example, L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point) costs 4 RED — too expensive now. But L1_34 (RED bonus) costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK — a common early target that gives a RED bonus. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN would help me afford this card in a future turn. All these colors have 4 tokens available, so I can safely take one of each. No token limit issues since I currently have 0 tokens.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: I'm player 1 on turn 1 with 0 tokens. Player 0 already took W:1, B:1, G:1 on their turn, leaving the board at: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:4, GOLD:5.

**Analyzing my options:**

1. **Take diverse tokens (W:1, B:1, G:1)** - Mirrors opponent's strategy, but slow path to affordability
2. **Take RED:2** - Focus on single-color path
3. **Reserve a card** - Secures future purchase + GOLD token

**Key insight:** L1_16 is the most directly achievable prestige card:
- Cost: RED:4 (single color requirement—simplest in Splendor)
- Value: 1 prestige + BLUE bonus
- This creates a clear 3-turn path to early momentum

**Decision: TAKE RED:2**

**Strategic pathway:**
- Turn 1 (now): Take RED:2 → total RED:2
- Turn 2: Take RED:2 → total RED:4
- Turn 3: Purchase L1_16 → gain 1 prestige + BLUE bonus + establish engine

**Why this over alternatives:**
- **vs diversifying**: Early prestige momentum matters in Splendor; psychological advantage of being on the board first is significant
- **vs reserving**: While GOLD tokens are valuable, they matter most mid/late-game for expensive purchases. Early concrete prestige beats conditional flexibility
- **Resource efficiency**: RED:4 is abundant on board; this doesn't create scarcity conflicts
- **Bonus establishment**: BLUE bonus from L1_16 immediately makes all future blue-requiring cards cheaper

**Verification:**
- Board RED tokens: 4 available (requirement: ≥4 for taking 2 of same) ✓
- Rule compliance: Exactly 2 tokens, same color ✓
- Token total: 0 current + 2 taking = 2 ≤ 10 limit ✓
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=2}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN token (3 total). My goal is to purchase L1_34 next turn, which costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK. I already have the BLUE and GREEN needed, and 1 of the 2 required WHITE. I still need 1 more WHITE and 1 BLACK. However, I can only take 3 different colors or 2 of the same color. Since WHITE has 3 tokens available (≥4 is required for taking 2, so I cannot take 2 WHITE), I cannot double-take WHITE. Therefore, the best option is to take one each of WHITE, BLACK, and a third color to stay flexible. RED is low on the board (only 2), so I avoid it. BLUE and GREEN are already in my hand, but I can still take them. However, BLACK is critical for L1_34, and I have none. So I take WHITE (to complete the 2 needed), BLACK (to cover the 1 needed), and, for the third, I choose RED to prepare for cards like L1_16 (4 RED) or L1_3 (needs 1 RED), though RED is scarce. Alternatively, taking another GREEN or BLUE doesn’t help as much right now. Since I must take 3 different colors, and I need WHITE and BLACK, the third is less critical—but RED might be contested. However, I note that taking WHITE, BLACK, and RED would give me the exact missing pieces for multiple L1 cards. I currently have 3 tokens; taking 3 more brings me to 6, well under the 10-token limit, so no returns needed. Thus, I take 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, and 1 RED.

======================================================================================

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL PIVOT: The board RED tokens collapsed from 2 to 1 (only RED:1 remains), breaking my original 3-turn plan to accumulate RED:4 for L1_16. However, a superior path emerges through GOLD token flexibility.

**Current Assessment:**
- My tokens: RED:2 (from Turn 1)
- Board: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:5
- Critical insight: L1_16 is the ONLY prestige-bearing card in Level 1 (1 prestige point)
- All other Level 1 cards offer 0 prestige—purely engine building

**Revised Strategy: Reserve L1_16 + GOLD Substitution Path**

Instead of chasing RED tokens on a depleted board, I'll leverage GOLD as a universal color substitute:

1. **Turn 2 (NOW):** Reserve L1_16
   - Action: Lock down the early prestige card before opponent contests it
   - Gain: 1 GOLD token (from board's 5 available)
   - Result: My hand becomes RED:2 + GOLD:1 (total: 3/10 tokens)

2. **Turn 3:** Execute purchase via GOLD substitution
   - Take RED:1 from board → RED:3 + GOLD:1
   - Purchase L1_16 using: RED:3 (actual tokens) + GOLD:1 (substitutes 1 RED)
   - Cost satisfied: RED:4 ✓
   - Gain: 1 prestige point + BLUE bonus + engine acceleration

**Why This Dominates Alternatives:**

**vs Taking 3 tokens now:** Token hoarding without prestige is weak. Early prestige = psychological momentum and board advantage. Gathering tokens for turn 3+ purchases leaves me trailing.

**vs Pursuing alternative prestige paths:**
- L2_63 (2 prestige): GREEN:5 — Board has only 3 GREEN total; unrealistic
- L2_50 (2 prestige): RED:1, W:2, K:4 — Requires 4 BLACK; board has 3 total
- L3 cards: 4+ prestige but cost 6-7 resources; impossible for early acquisition

**Game-Winning Advantage:**
- L1_16 provides BLUE bonus, reducing cost of all future BLUE-requiring cards
- Opponent has BLUE:1 only; I'll gain BLUE bonus and widen my resource advantage
- **Early prestige by Turn 3** gives momentum, psychological edge, and board presence
- Secures the card before opponent reserves it

**Risk Assessment:**
- RED:1 remains on board for Turn 3 grab—opponent has RED:1 already and is diversifying (unlikely to contest)
- GOLD scarcity: 5 available; claiming 1 is justified
- Token limit: 3 tokens post-reserve is well below 10-token limit; expansion room safe

**Verification:**
- L1_16 is visible in LEVEL_1 face-up cards ✓
- GOLD:5 available on board for claiming ✓
- Reserve capacity: 0/3 (I can reserve) ✓
- Post-reserve token state (3/10) is sustainable ✓
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_16, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK token — exactly the cost of L1_34 (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK). Purchasing this card gives me a RED bonus, which will help with future cards like L1_35 (needs BLACK and GREEN, which I can now support better) and potentially Level 2/3 RED-heavy cards. This is a high-priority Level 1 card that provides immediate engine value. All required tokens are in hand, and the card is face-up and available. No tokens need to be returned since this purchase will reduce my total tokens from 6 to 2, well below the 10-token limit. This is the optimal move to convert tokens into a permanent bonus and progress toward higher-value purchases.

======================================================================================

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: EXECUTION PHASE: Completing L1_16 via token acquisition + gold substitution

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My tokens: RED:2, GOLD:1 (3/10)
- Reserved: L1_16 (RED:4 cost, 1 prestige point + BLUE bonus)
- Board: WHITE:4, BLUE:4, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:4, GOLD:4
- L1_16 is the ONLY prestige card in Level 1—critical early acquisition

**THE WINNING PATH:**

I have RED:2 + GOLD:1. To purchase L1_16 (RED:4 cost):
- RED:2 (actual tokens) + GOLD:1 (universal substitute) = RED:3 coverage
- I need RED:1 more → exactly RED:1 available on board!
- After acquiring RED:1: RED:3 + GOLD:1 (substitute) = RED:4 ✓

**THIS TURN (TURN 3):**
Take RED:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1 (exactly 3 different colors = legal)
- Verify board supply: RED:1 ✓, WHITE:4 ✓, BLUE:1 ✓
- Verify token limit: 3 current + 3 taking = 6/10 ✓
- Result: RED:3, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens, well under limit)

**NEXT TURN (TURN 4):**
Purchase L1_16:
- Cost: RED:4
- Pay with: RED:3 (actual) + GOLD:1 (as RED substitute) = RED:4 ✓
- Remove L1_16 from reserved hand, add to purchased
- Gain: +1 prestige point + BLUE bonus
- Leftover tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1

**STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:**
1. **Early prestige** secures psychological momentum (I'm first on scoreboard)
2. **BLUE bonus** is game-accelerating—reduces ALL future BLUE card costs by 1 (opponent has BLUE:0, vast advantage multiplier)
3. **Zero waste**—this completes the 2-turn reservation+acquisition sequence with maximum efficiency
4. **Opponent locked out**—opponent has RED:1 but cannot contest RED:1 on board since I'm taking it; opponent's engine (RED bonus) is temporarily capped
5. **Turn economy**—reaching 1 prestige in 3 turns (turn 1: tokens, turn 2: reserve, turn 3: tokens, turn 4: purchase) is efficient trajectory

**VERIFIED RULES COMPLIANCE:**
- Token rule: 3 colors (RED:1 + WHITE:1 + BLUE:1) ✓
- Supply check: All colors available on board ✓
- Token limit: 6 ≤ 10, no returns needed ✓
- Card legality: L1_16 is in my reserved hand (not opponent's) ✓
- Timing: Tokens this turn → purchase next turn (separate legal turns) ✓

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 1 RED token and a RED bonus from my purchased card L1_34. My token count is 1 (only RED). My goal is to build toward affordable Level 1 or Level 2 cards that align with my RED bonus. Looking at the face-up Level 1 cards: L1_35 costs 2 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 2 BLACK and gives RED bonus — but I already have RED bonus, so redundant. L1_28 (GREEN bonus) costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. L1_3 (BLACK bonus) costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED — I can cover the RED with my bonus, so need 2 WHITE + 2 BLUE. L1_21 (WHITE bonus) costs 2 RED + 1 BLACK — I can cover both REDs with my bonus, so only need 1 BLACK. That’s very affordable! However, I currently have no BLACK token, so if I take 1 BLACK, I could buy L1_21 next turn. But I can’t take just 1 token — must take 3 different or 2 same. BLACK has 4 available (ok for double), but taking 2 BLACK now would give me 2, and I only need 1 for L1_21 — inefficient. Better to take 3 colors to stay flexible. Also, Level 2 cards: L2_63 and L2_64 are pure GREEN (5 or 6) — too expensive now. L2_50 (BLUE bonus, 2 pts) costs 2 WHITE, 1 RED, 4 BLACK — I can cover RED with bonus, so need 2 WHITE + 4 BLACK — too much. L2_54 requires RED which I can cover, but 2 WHITE + 3 BLUE — possible mid-game. Noble N10 requires RED 3, WHITE 3, BLACK 3 — I have RED 1 bonus, so could work toward that. So I should collect WHITE, BLACK, and another color. Available token counts: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=4, RED=0, BLACK=4. I cannot take RED (0 available). Best trio: WHITE, BLACK, and GREEN (all ≥3, GREEN has 4). This gives me flexibility for L1_28 (needs GREEN, WHITE, BLUE), L1_35 (needs WHITE, GREEN, BLACK), or L2_54 (needs WHITE, BLUE). I currently have 1 token; taking 3 brings me to 4 — no return needed. So I take 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, and 1 GREEN.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: EXECUTION OF PLANNED PURCHASE SEQUENCE

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- Turn 4 (as expected from previous reasoning)
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:3, GOLD:1 (total: 6/10)
- Reserved card: L1_16 (RED:4 cost, 1 prestige, BLUE bonus)
- Board: RED:0 (exactly as expected after my RED:1 grab last turn)

**THE WINNING EXECUTION:**

Turn 3 (completed): I took RED:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1 → reached RED:3, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GOLD:1

Turn 4 (NOW): PURCHASE L1_16

**Cost Analysis:**
- L1_16 requires: RED:4
- I have: RED:3 (actual tokens) + GOLD:1 (universal substitute)
- Payment: RED:3 (actual) + GOLD:1 (covers missing RED:1) = RED:4 satisfied ✓

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Purchased cards: L1_16 ✓
- Prestige score: 0 → 1 (FIRST prestige on board!)
- Bonuses: {} → {BLUE:1} (game-accelerating multiplier)
- Remaining tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1 (freed up GOLD:1 for purchase)

**STRATEGIC DOMINANCE:**
1. **Early board presence**: I'm now 1-0 on prestige while opponent remains at 0—psychological momentum established
2. **BLUE bonus multiplier**: All future BLUE-requiring cards cost 1 less. This compounds throughout the game. Opponent has zero bonuses.
3. **Level 1 prestige locked**: L1_16 was the ONLY Level 1 card with prestige (1 point). No opponent can contest it now.
4. **Efficient turn economy**: 4 turns to reach 1 prestige is strong early trajectory
5. **Engine foundation laid**: BLUE bonus makes L2_54 (1 prestige, WHITE:2 BLUE:3 RED:3) and other BLUE-heavy cards accessible

**RULE VERIFICATION:**
- Card in reserved hand ✓
- Cost satisfiable (RED:3 + GOLD:1) ✓
- No token overage (I'm purchasing, not gaining tokens) ✓
- Card not already purchased ✓
- Clear path to next prestige card with BLUE bonus acceleration ✓

**NEXT PHASE PREVIEW:**
With BLUE:1 bonus, I can now pursue:
- L2_54 (WHITE:2 BLUE:2 RED:3) → requires only 2 BLUE effective (due to bonus), 2 WHITE, 3 RED
- Secondary engine building with remaining tokens
- Push toward 15 prestige before opponent establishes momentum

This purchase completes the 2-turn reservation+execution strategy flawlessly.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (4 total). I also have a RED bonus from L1_34. L1_21 costs 2 RED and 1 BLACK. My RED bonus covers both RED costs, so I only need to pay 1 BLACK token, which I have. Purchasing L1_21 gives me a WHITE bonus, which is valuable for Level 2 cards like L2_54 (needs 2 WHITE) and L2_50 (needs 2 WHITE), and also progresses me toward Noble N10 (needs WHITE 3, BLACK 3, RED 3) and N8 (needs WHITE 3). This is an efficient purchase: it costs only 1 token, gives a useful bonus, and moves me closer to higher-point cards. The card is face-up and available, and I have the required resources. No token limit issues (post-purchase tokens: 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED → total 3).

======================================================================================

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2}
Reasoning: Turn 5 assessment: I'm leading 1-0 in prestige with BLUE:1 bonus. Opponent is at 0 prestige but actively building RED engine (already holds RED:1 bonus + WHITE:1 bonus from L1_34 and L1_21). This signals opponent is likely targeting red-heavy cards like L2_54 or high-prestige cards with RED costs (L3_81). 

**Why reserve L2_54 NOW?** (1) **Prestige security**: L2_54 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3. With my BLUE:1 bonus, effective cost becomes WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:3—achieving this over 2-3 turns is realistic. Securing it blocks opponent from disrupting. (2) **Opponent disruption**: Opponent with RED heavy bonuses would find L2_54 very efficient (RED:3 costs become cheaper with RED bonuses). By reserving, I deny opponent option and force them toward harder targets like L3_81 (requires BLACK:6, operationally prohibitive). (3) **GOLD acquisition**: Reserve grants GOLD:1 token, providing universal color substitution. (4) **Token efficiency**: Post-reserve state = WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GOLD:1 (4/10 tokens), well under limit. (5) **Clear prestige path**: L2_54 gives 1 prestige (total 2) + WHITE bonus (enables future multi-bonus synergies). 

**Alternatives rejected**: Taking 3 tokens now delays prestige momentum while opponent builds. Reserving L2_50 requires BLACK:4 (entire board supply—operationally unsafe). Reserving L2_63 locks me into slow GREEN:5 accumulation. L2_54 is optimal balance of achievability + prestige value + opponent disruption. Next 2-3 turns: Accumulate tokens until WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:3, then purchase L2_54 for +1 prestige + WHITE bonus multiplier.

======================================================================================

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=1 (2 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1 and RED=1. My goal is to build toward affordable cards that leverage these bonuses. Looking at face-up options: L1_3 (BLACK bonus) costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. My RED bonus covers the RED cost, and my WHITE bonus covers 1 WHITE, so I’d need to pay 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE. I already have 1 WHITE token, so I need 2 more BLUE. L1_28 (GREEN bonus) costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. My WHITE bonus covers the WHITE, so I need 3 BLUE + 1 GREEN. I have 1 GREEN, so I’d need 3 BLUE. L1_25 (GREEN bonus) costs 1 of each non-GOLD color. My WHITE and RED bonuses cover WHITE and RED, so I only need to pay 1 BLUE + 1 BLACK + 1 GREEN. I have 1 GREEN, so I’d need BLUE and BLACK. On the Level 2 front, L2_50 (2 pts) costs 2 WHITE, 1 RED, 4 BLACK. My bonuses cover both WHITE and RED, so I only need 4 BLACK — very efficient later. L2_66 (1 pt) costs 3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK. My RED bonus covers 1 RED, so I’d still need 3 BLUE, 1 RED, 3 BLACK — too much now. Noble N10 (3 pts) requires RED=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3 — I have RED=1 and WHITE=1 bonuses, so I need to collect BLACK to contribute toward this. Given all this, BLUE and BLACK are the most valuable colors to acquire. I can take 3 different colors. Available token counts: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=4. I don’t need more WHITE or GREEN right now. I need BLUE (for L1_3, L1_28, L1_25) and BLACK (for L1_25, L2_50, Noble N10). The third color should be RED, but I already have RED bonus and don’t urgently need RED tokens — however, RED is plentiful and could help with L2_66 or other cards. Alternatively, taking only two colors isn’t allowed unless doubling, and BLUE and BLACK both have <4 tokens (BLUE=3, BLACK=4), so I can double BLACK (since ≥4). But doubling BLACK now would give me 2, and I might need up to 4 for L2_50 — but taking 2 BLACK + 1 BLUE would be better than 1 each? However, the rule says I can only take 2 of the same if ≥4 available — BLACK has 4, so allowed. But I only have 2 tokens now; taking 2 BLACK would bring me to 4, still under 10. But is 2 BLACK better than 1 BLACK + 1 BLUE + 1 RED? I need BLUE more urgently: without BLUE, I can’t buy L1_3, L1_28, or L1_25. L1_25 is very attractive: with my bonuses, it only costs BLUE=1, BLACK=1, GREEN=1. I already have GREEN=1, so if I get 1 BLUE and 1 BLACK, I can buy it next turn for 3 tokens, gaining a GREEN bonus. That’s efficient. So I need at least 1 BLUE and 1 BLACK. Since I must take 3 tokens, I’ll take 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK, and a third. The third could be RED (available 4) to prepare for cards requiring RED tokens (since my bonus only covers 1), or GREEN (but I already have GREEN token and L1_25 gives GREEN bonus, so maybe redundant). RED is useful for flexibility and for Noble N2 (needs RED=4, GREEN=4). I’ll take BLUE, BLACK, and RED. This gives me the pieces for L1_25 next turn (if I get 1 each), and keeps options open. Current tokens: 2. Taking 3 brings me to 5 — no return needed. So I take 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK, 1 RED.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **TURN 6 STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:**

**Current State:**
- My score: 1 prestige (L1_16), BLUE:1 bonus
- Opponent score: 0 prestige, RED:1 + WHITE:1 bonuses
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:0, GOLD:1 (3/10)
- Reserved: L2_54 (WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3 cost = WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:3 effective with my BLUE:1 bonus → 1 prestige + WHITE bonus)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:4

**Threat Assessment:**
Opponent's most viable prestige path is L2_66 (1 prestige, RED bonus):
- Cost: BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3
- With opponent's RED:1 bonus: needs BLUE:3, RED:1 effective, BLACK:3
- Opponent currently has W:1, B:1, G:1, R:1, K:1 (5/10)
- Timeline to L2_66: ~3 turns minimum (requires +2 BLUE, +2 BLACK tokens = 4 tokens over 2+ turns)

**My L2_54 Purchase Timeline:**
- Currently need: WHITE:+1, BLUE:+1, RED:+3
- Option A - Take tokens now:
  - Turn 6 (now): Take WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1 → reach WHITE:2✓, BLUE:2✓, RED:1 (need RED:2 more)
  - Turn 7: Take RED:2 → reach WHITE:2✓, BLUE:2✓, RED:3✓ (8/10 tokens)
  - Turn 8: Purchase L2_54 → 2 prestige total + WHITE bonus
- Option B - Reserve for GOLD:
  - Delays token acquisition by 1 turn
  - Slower path to L2_54 (now turn 9 instead of turn 8)
  - Not worth the delay

**Why THIS action (take 3 colors now):**
1. **Maintain prestige lead:** I'm 1-0; reaching 2-0 before opponent's first prestige point extends dominance
2. **Board efficiency:** Diversifying colors (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1) captures maximum utility without board scarcity conflicts
3. **Turn economy:** Completes L2_54 purchase by turn 8; opponent L2_66 realistic by turn 9
4. **Token room:** 3 current + 3 taking = 6/10 (well under limit, zero returns needed)
5. **Compound advantage:** Gaining L2_54 + WHITE bonus creates multi-color synergy when combined with BLUE:1 bonus for future high-prestige cards

**Verification:**
- Legal token combo: 3 colors (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1) ✓
- Board supply: WHITE:2✓, BLUE:2✓, RED:3✓ all available
- Token limit: 3+3=6≤10 ✓
- Progress toward L2_54: WHITE→2/2✓, BLUE→2/2✓, RED→1/3 (near complete)
- No card conflicts: All cards legal ✓
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (5 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1 and RED=1. L1_25 costs 1 of each non-GOLD color: WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK. My WHITE bonus covers the WHITE cost, and my RED bonus covers the RED cost. Therefore, I only need to pay 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK — all of which I have in hand. Purchasing L1_25 gives me a GREEN bonus, which is valuable for multiple Level 2 cards (L2_63, L2_64, L2_66) and the N2 and N8 nobles. This is a highly efficient use of tokens: I convert 3 tokens into a permanent GREEN bonus with no prestige loss (since L1 cards give 0 points, but the bonus enables future points). The card is face-up and available. After purchase, I’ll have tokens: WHITE=1, RED=1 (2 total), well under the 10-token limit. This is clearly better than taking more tokens or reserving, as it immediately strengthens my engine.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 7 CONTINUATION: Executing phase 2 of L2_54 acquisition plan.

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1, GOLD:1 (6/10)
- Reserved: L2_54 (WHITE:2, BLUE:2 effective [with BLUE:1 bonus], RED:3 required)
- Board: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:4, GOLD:4
- Prestige: 1 (opponent: 0) ✓ Leading

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR L2_54:**
I currently have WHITE:2✓, BLUE:2✓, RED:1✗
Missing: RED:2

**BOARD CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:**
Board RED:2 available. I cannot take RED:2 in a single action (rule requires 4+ on board for 2-same tokens). I must take 3 different colors, then gather RED:1 more on turn 8.

**THIS TURN'S OPTIMAL PATH:**
Take RED:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1
- Legally satisfies 3-color requirement ✓
- Captures RED:1 (most critical resource)
- Leaves board RED:1 for next turn—sufficient for my Red:3 completion
- New token state: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (9/10)
- Still need RED:1 more → Turn 8 action

**TURN 8 PROJECTION:**
Take RED:1, WHITE:1, GREEN:1 → WHITE:3, BLUE:2, RED:3, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (10/10)

**TURN 9 PURCHASE:**
Buy L2_54 with WHITE:2, BLUE:2 [effective], RED:3 ✓
Reach 2 prestige + activate WHITE:1 bonus multiplier

**OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:**
Opponent (0 prestige, 5 tokens) likely targeting L2_66 (BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3 cost = BLUE:3, RED:1 effective).
Opponent needs ~6 more tokens—3 turns minimum to compete.
My 2-prestige by turn 9 establishes dominant lead before opponent's first prestige acquisition.

**BOARD SAFETY:**
RED:1 remains after this turn. Opponent with RED:1 bonus has no urgent need for singleton RED token this turn; opponent prioritizes BLUE/BLACK for L2_66. Red contention risk: LOW.

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ 3 colors, 1 each (legal)
✓ Board supply: RED:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:4 (all sufficient)
✓ Token limit: 6+3=9 ≤10 (no returns required)
✓ Prestige momentum: 1→2 by turn 9 (dominant trajectory)
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, RED=1 (2 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. My goal is to efficiently accumulate resources to purchase prestige-point cards or qualify for Nobles. Looking at affordable options: L1_3 (BLACK bonus) costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. My WHITE and RED bonuses cover 1 WHITE and 1 RED, so I need to pay 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE. I have 1 WHITE token, so I need 2 BLUE. L1_28 (GREEN bonus) costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. My WHITE and GREEN bonuses cover WHITE and GREEN, so I only need 3 BLUE — very attractive! L2_50 (2 pts) costs 2 WHITE, 1 RED, 4 BLACK. My WHITE and RED bonuses cover all WHITE and RED costs, so I only need 4 BLACK — excellent long-term target. L2_66 (1 pt) costs 3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK. My RED bonus covers 1 RED, so I need 3 BLUE, 1 RED, 3 BLACK — too much now, but possible later. Noble N10 (3 pts) requires RED=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3 — I have RED=1 and WHITE=1 bonuses, so I need to collect BLACK to meet this. Noble N8 (3 pts) requires GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3 — I have GREEN=1 and WHITE=1 bonuses, so I need BLUE and WHITE tokens. Given this, BLUE and BLACK are the most critical colors: BLUE for L1_28, L2_66, and N8; BLACK for L2_50, L2_66, and N10. The board has BLUE=2 and BLACK=3 available. I cannot take 2 BLUE (only 2 available, and doubling requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors. I need BLUE and BLACK. The third color should be WHITE or GREEN, but I already have WHITE and GREEN bonuses and don’t urgently need those tokens. However, RED has only 1 available on the board — taking it would leave 0, but I already have RED bonus, so not critical. But I must choose a third color. Available counts: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=3. All are ≥1, so any trio is possible. Since BLUE and BLACK are essential, and I have no BLUE or BLACK tokens currently, I’ll take 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK, and the only other viable third: GREEN (since WHITE=1 and RED=1 are low, but GREEN=2 is slightly better). However, wait — I already have GREEN bonus, so GREEN tokens are less urgent. But I need a third color, and all options are similar. BLUE and BLACK are non-negotiable. Taking GREEN gives me flexibility for L2_63/L2_64 later (pure GREEN Level 2s). So I take 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK, and 1 GREEN. Current tokens: 2. Taking 3 brings me to 5 — no return needed.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **TURN 8 EXECUTION: Final Token Assembly for L2_54 Purchase**

**CURRENT POSITION VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (9/10) ✓ On track
- Reserved: L2_54 (cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3 → effective WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:3 with BLUE:1 bonus)
- My prestige: 1 (opponent: 0) - maintaining dominant lead
- Bonuses: BLUE:1 (game-accelerating multiplier)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR L2_54 PURCHASE NEXT TURN:**
- Currently have: WHITE:2✓, BLUE:2✓, RED:2✗
- Missing: RED:1 (to reach RED:3 needed for purchase)
- This is the final token deficit blocking my 2nd prestige point

**BOARD SUPPLY VERIFICATION:**
Available tokens: WHITE:1✓, BLUE:1, GREEN:1✓, RED:1✓, BLACK:2✓, GOLD:4
- All colors I need are in stock

**TOKEN ACQUISITION STRATEGY:**
Take exactly 3 different colors (legal rule compliance):
- RED:1 (critical - closes deficit for L2_54)
- WHITE:1 (safe excess token)
- GREEN:1 (safe excess token)

**TOKEN LIMIT MANAGEMENT:**
- Current: 9/10 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens
- Sum before return: 12/10 ❌ EXCEEDS LIMIT
- Must return: 2 tokens to comply with 10-token cap

**STRATEGIC RETURN DECISION:**
After taking (before return): WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (12)

For L2_54 purchase requirements: WHITE:2, BLUE:2 (effective), RED:3 = 7 essential tokens
Excess tokens available: WHITE:1 (spare), GREEN:2 (not needed), BLACK:1 (not needed), GOLD:1 (keep as wildcard)

Optimal return: GREEN:1 + BLACK:1
- Preserves GOLD token as future wildcard
- Removes non-essential gems
- Final state: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, GOLD:1 (10/10 tokens, power-optimized)

**TURN 9 (NEXT) PURCHASE LOCK:**
With these tokens, I'll purchase L2_54:
- Cost satisfied: WHITE:2 ✓ + BLUE:2 (actual, need 3 reduced by BLUE:1 bonus) ✓ + RED:3 ✓
- Gain: +1 prestige (total 2-0 lead) + WHITE:1 bonus (multi-bonus synergy)
- Opponent still at 0 prestige (minimum 3 turns away from first prestige card)

**OPPONENT THREAT MINIMIZED:**
Opponent has 6 tokens and 3 bonuses but no prestige yet. Timeline to L2_66 (their best option): 3-4 more turns. My 2-0 lead by turn 9 creates insurmountable momentum before they score first point.

**RULE COMPLIANCE FINAL CHECK:**
✓ Token rule: 3 colors (RED:1, WHITE:1, GREEN:1) = legal
✓ Board supply: All colors >= 1 available
✓ Token limit: 9+3-2 = 10 ≤ 10 compliant
✓ Return valid: Discarding non-essential tokens
✓ Card acquisition path: Purchase L2_54 confirmed for turn 9

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 (6 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. My goal is to purchase high-efficiency cards that yield points or progress toward Nobles. L1_28 (GREEN bonus) costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. My WHITE and GREEN bonuses cover WHITE and GREEN, so I only need 3 BLUE tokens. I currently have 1 BLUE, so I need 2 more BLUE. However, the board only has 1 BLUE token available, so I cannot take 2 BLUE (and doubling requires ≥4 anyway). L1_3 (BLACK bonus) costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. My WHITE and RED bonuses cover 1 WHITE and 1 RED, so I need 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE. I have 1 WHITE token, so again need 2 BLUE — impossible now. L2_50 (2 pts) costs 2 WHITE, 1 RED, 4 BLACK. My bonuses cover all WHITE and RED, so I only need 4 BLACK. The board has 3 BLACK tokens available — I currently have 1 BLACK, so if I take all 3 BLACK, I’d have 4, enough to buy L2_50 next turn! But I can’t take 3 BLACK — the rule allows only 2 of the same color if ≥4 available, and BLACK has only 3 on board, so I cannot double BLACK. So I must take 3 different colors. Available token counts: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=3. I cannot take WHITE or RED (0 available). So the only possible trio is BLUE, GREEN, BLACK (all ≥1). I already have GREEN=2 tokens and GREEN bonus, so GREEN is less urgent, but it’s the only third option. Taking 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK brings me to 9 tokens total (6+3), which is acceptable (≤10). This gives me BLUE=2 (still short of 3 for L1_28, but closer), BLACK=2 (helps toward L2_50’s 4), and GREEN=3 (redundant but harmless). Next turn, if BLUE replenishes, I can take more BLUE for L1_28, or if BLACK reaches 4 on board, I could double it. This is the only legal and productive move given the board’s limited WHITE/RED.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 9 EXECUTION: L2_54 PURCHASE - SECURING 2-0 PRESTIGE LEAD

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (10/10) ✓ Exactly as planned from Turn 8
- Reserved card: L2_54 (in hand, ready for purchase)
- My prestige: 1 (opponent: 0) - maintaining dominant lead
- My bonuses: BLUE:1 (will add WHITE:1 post-purchase)

**L2_54 PURCHASE VERIFICATION:**

Card Details:
- L2_54: Cost WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3 | 1 prestige | WHITE bonus

Payment Calculation:
- Card cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3
- My BLUE:1 bonus reduces BLUE requirement: 3-1=2 effective
- Actual payment needed: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:3
- I have: WHITE:3✓, BLUE:2✓, RED:3✓ (all sufficient)

Post-Purchase Token State:
- Spend: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:3
- Remaining: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (3/10 tokens)

**PRESTIGE & BONUS ACCELERATION:**
- New score: 1 + 1 = 2 prestige (opponent: still 0)
- New bonuses: BLUE:1 + WHITE:1 (multi-bonus engine unlocked)
- Lead status: Unassailable 2-0 lead on prestige

**GAME DOMINANCE ANALYSIS:**
1. **Prestige Momentum**: 2-0 at turn 9 is insurmountable. Opponent needs minimum 2-3 more turns to reach first prestige. I'll achieve 3-4 prestige before their first point.
2. **Dual-Bonus Synergy**: BLUE:1 + WHITE:1 bonuses create cascading advantage:
   - L2_50 (2 prestige): WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:4 → effective WHITE:1 (with WHITE bonus)
   - L2_66 (1 prestige): BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3 → effective BLUE:2 (with BLUE bonus)
   - L2_64 (3 prestige): GREEN:6 (independent, bonus-agnostic)
3. **Strategic Inevitability**: With early prestige lock + multi-bonus foundation, reaching 15 prestige is guaranteed before opponent closes gap
4. **Opponent Stalled**: Opponent has 3 bonuses (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1) but 0 prestige—momentum lag is fatal to their comeback

**TURN 10+ PROJECTION:**
With GOLD:1 + 3 tokens remaining, I'll rebuild reserves by:
- Taking 3-token combinations (e.g., WHITE:1, RED:1, GREEN:1)
- Or reserving high-prestige Level 2/3 cards (L2_50 for 2 prestige, L2_64 for 3 prestige)
- Continue accelerating toward 15-point victory

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ L2_54 in reserved cards and available
✓ Cost satisfiable with bonus (WHITE:2 + BLUE:2 effective + RED:3)
✓ No token overage on payment
✓ Prestige awarded correctly
✓ Bonus activated (WHITE:1 bonus added to inventory)
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_54]

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2 (9 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. My WHITE bonus covers the WHITE cost, and my GREEN bonus covers the GREEN cost. Thus, I only need to pay 3 BLUE tokens. I have exactly 2 BLUE tokens, which is insufficient—wait, correction: I have BLUE=2 tokens, but need 3. However, rechecking the game state: my tokens show BLUE=2, yes. But wait—L1_28 is still on the board, and I previously aimed for it. Alternatively, consider L1_3: costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. My WHITE and RED bonuses cover 1 WHITE and 1 RED, so I need to pay 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE. I have WHITE=1 and BLUE=2, so that’s exactly enough! L1_3 gives a BLACK bonus, which is critical for L2_50 (needs 4 BLACK) and Noble N10 (needs BLACK=3). Purchasing L1_3 uses 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE, leaving me with tokens: GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2 (6 total), and adds a BLACK bonus. This is efficient: it costs 3 tokens, provides a needed BLACK bonus, and progresses toward high-value targets. L1_28 is not currently affordable (needs 3 BLUE, I have 2), so L1_3 is the best available purchase.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_28]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_28
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2 (total = 9 tokens). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. The previous move attempted to purchase L1_28 but failed due to insufficient BLUE tokens: L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN; my bonuses cover WHITE and GREEN, so I need 3 BLUE tokens, but I only have 2. The board now shows available tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=3, BLACK=2. Since I have 9 tokens, I can only take 1 more token without exceeding the 10-token limit—but the rules require taking EXACTLY 3 tokens of 3 different colors OR 2 of the same color (if ≥4 available). Therefore, I cannot legally take just 1 BLUE. I must either take 3 different colors (and return 2 tokens to stay ≤10) or take 2 of one color (if possible). Let’s evaluate options: BLUE is critical—I need 1 more to buy L1_28 next turn. BLUE has 2 on board, so I cannot double it (requires ≥4). Same for BLACK (2 available). RED has 3 (still <4), so no doubling possible. Thus, I must take 3 different colors. Available colors: WHITE (2), BLUE (2), RED (3), BLACK (2). GREEN is 0, so not an option. I need BLUE, so that’s one. The other two should be chosen to minimize useless tokens. I already have GREEN=3 (excessive), WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. WHITE could help with L1_3 (needs 2 WHITE; my bonus covers 1, so I’d need 1 more WHITE token) or L2_50/N10 (I have WHITE bonus=1, need more WHITE toward N10’s requirement of 3). BLACK is needed for L2_50 (needs 4; I have 2, so 2 more). RED is less urgent (bonus=1, and few cards require extra RED beyond bonus). So best trio: BLUE (essential), BLACK (for L2_50/N10), and WHITE (for L1_3/N10). Taking 1 each of BLUE, BLACK, WHITE will bring me to 12 tokens (9+3), so I must return 2 tokens to stay at 10. Which tokens to return? I have GREEN=3, which is excessive—only L2_63/L2_64 need GREEN, but they cost 5–6 GREEN, and I only have GREEN bonus=1, so not feasible soon. Returning 2 GREEN tokens is optimal: I’ll still have 1 GREEN (enough for any immediate GREEN cost, like L1_28’s 1 GREEN, which is covered by bonus anyway). After action: tokens = WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 (10 total). This gives me exactly 3 BLUE to buy L1_28 next turn, plus progress toward L1_3 (needs 2 BLUE + 1 WHITE—I’d have that) and L2_50 (needs 4 BLACK—I’d have 3, close). Returning GREEN is safe and efficient.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={GREEN=2}]

======================================================================================

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 10 STRATEGIC PIVOT: Shifting focus from L2_50 to NOBLE N10 pathway given board token constraints.

**CRITICAL BOARD CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:**
L2_50 requires K:4. With BLACK:1 on board, I can only take K:1/turn maximum = 4 turns minimum. This is too slow given opponent is about to score their first prestige (L2_66).

**BETTER PATH: NOBLE N10 (3 prestige in one action)**
N10 requirements: R:3, W:3, K:3 (actual tokens, no bonus reduction)
- I have: W:1
- I need: R:3, W:2 more, K:3
- Total deficit: 8 tokens across R, W, K

**4-TURN PROJECTION TO NOBLE VICTORY:**
- Turn 10 (NOW): Take RED:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1 → reach W:1, G:2, R:1, K:1, GOLD:1 (6/10 tokens)
- Turn 11: Take RED:1, BLACK:1, BLUE:1 → reach W:1, B:1, G:2, R:2, K:2 (8/10 tokens)
- Turn 12: Take RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1 → reach W:2, G:2, R:3✓, K:3✓ (9/10 tokens)
- Turn 13: Take WHITE:1 + 2 others → reach W:3✓, R:3✓, K:3✓ (10/10 tokens) → **VISIT N10 FOR +3 PRESTIGE**
- **Prestige by turn 13: 2 + 3 = 5 total**

**OPPONENT THREAT TIMELINE:**
- Turn 11: Opponent likely purchases L2_66 (1 prestige) → opponent reaches 1 prestige
- Turns 12-14: Opponent needs to accumulate 4+ more tokens for next card
- By turn 13, I reach 5 prestige while opponent is still at 1 → establishes 4-point lead

**WHY NOT RESERVE L2_50?**
Reserving delays prestige acquisition by 1 turn and locks me into a 2-prestige card path that's slow (requires K:4 over 4 turns). The noble path is FASTER: 3 prestige in 4 turns vs L2_50's 2 prestige in 4+ turns.

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- Take RED:1 (RED:3 available ✓)
- Take BLACK:1 (BLACK:1 available ✓)
- Take GREEN:1 (GREEN:2 available ✓)
- 3 different colors = legal ✓
- Token limit: 3 current + 3 taking = 6 ≤ 10 ✓
- No returns needed ✓

**TURN 10 ACTION:**
Tokens after: W:1, G:2, R:1, K:1, GOLD:1 (6/10)
Momentum: Positioned to reach 5 prestige by turn 13, establishing decisive 4-0 prestige lead before opponent can respond.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 (10 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. L1_28 (GREEN bonus, 0 pts) costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. My WHITE bonus covers the 1 WHITE cost, and my GREEN bonus covers the 1 GREEN cost, so I only need to pay 3 BLUE tokens — which I have exactly (BLUE=3). Purchasing L1_28 gives me a second GREEN bonus, increasing my GREEN bonus to 2. This is highly valuable for future Level 2 cards like L2_63 (5 GREEN) and L2_64 (6 GREEN), and for Noble N8 (requires GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3 — I’ll then have GREEN=2 bonus, needing only 1 more GREEN token). It’s also a productive use of my excess BLUE tokens. After purchase, my tokens will be: WHITE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 (7 total), well under the 10 limit. This is the optimal move — converting 3 BLUE tokens into a permanent bonus that accelerates my engine toward points.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **TURN 11 CRITICAL REASSESSMENT:**

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6/10)
- My prestige: 2 (opponent: 0) - maintaining lead
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1
- Board state: WHITE:1, BLUE:4, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:4

**CRITICAL PROBLEM WITH ORIGINAL N10 PLAN:**
My Turn 10 projected N10 path required BLACK tokens on each of the next 3 turns. **BOARD NOW SHOWS BLACK:0** - this breaks the N10 path entirely. I cannot gather BLACK:3 required for N10 if board has 0 BLACK. The N10 strategy (as projected in Turn 10) is NO LONGER VIABLE.

**CARDS CURRENTLY AFFORDABLE?**
Verifying all prestige cards:
- L1_24 (1 prestige, GREEN:4): I have GREEN:2, cannot afford ❌
- L2_50 (2 prestige, WHITE:1 effective + RED:1 + BLACK:4): I have W:1✓, R:1✓, K:1 (need K:3 more), cannot afford ❌
- L2_66 (1 prestige, BLUE:2 effective + RED:2 + BLACK:3): I have B:0, cannot afford ❌
- L2_63/L2_64/L3_*: All require 5+ of same color, not affordable ❌

None are purchasable right now. Must focus on TOKEN ACCUMULATION.

**STRATEGIC PIVOT: L3_84 PATH (4 prestige, BLUE:7 cost)**

The board has abundant BLUE:4. I can execute:
1. **Turn 11 (NOW)**: Take BLUE:2, RED:1 → reach BLUE:2 → (8/10 tokens)
2. **Turn 12**: Take BLUE:2, WHITE:1 → reach BLUE:4 → (9/10 tokens)
3. **Turn 13**: RESERVE L3_84 → get GOLD:1 (total GOLD:2) → cards now reserved include L3_84
4. **Turn 14**: PURCHASE L3_84 using BLUE:4 (actual) + GOLD:2 (as wildcards) = 6 effective gems needed with BLUE:1 bonus (7-1=6)
   - Cost: BLUE:7 effective = BLUE:6 actual with my bonus
   - Payment: 4 BLUE tokens + 2 GOLD tokens substitute for 2 BLUE = 6 total fulfilled ✓
   - Gain: 4 prestige → Reach 2+4=6 total prestige ✓

**OPPONENT THREAT ANALYSIS:**
Opponent also blocked by BLACK:0 scarcity. They cannot complete L2_66 (requires BLACK:3). Timeline to next prestige card: 4+ turns minimum. By turn 14, I'll be at 6 prestige while opponent still at 0.

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- BLUE:4 on board ✓ (can take BLUE:2)
- RED:2 on board ✓ (can take RED:1)
- Legal token action: BLUE:2 + RED:1 (2-same-color rule + 1 other color) ✓
- Token limit: 6 current + 3 taking = 9 ≤ 10 ✓

**WHY THIS TURN 11 ACTION:**
Begins L3_84 accumulation. This is the fastest non-blocked prestige path available given board constraints. Takes maximum BLUE:2 to force-complete the 4 BLUE needed by turn 12, then reserve on turn 13 to get wildcard GOLD for flexible turn 14 purchase.

**GAME DOMINANCE LOCK:**
Reaching 6 prestige by turn 14 (opponent at 0) establishes an insurmountable 6-0 lead, making 15-point victory inevitable.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=2, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: TURN 11 BOARD STATE ANALYSIS - Critical Resource Bottleneck Identified

**CURRENT POSITION:**
- My prestige: 2 (opponent: 0) - maintaining 2-point lead
- My tokens: W:1, B:0, G:2, R:1, K:1, GOLD:1 (6/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1 (dual-bonus synergy active)

**AVAILABLE RESOURCES CRISIS:**
Board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:4, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:4

Critical observation: **BLACK:0 on board**. Opponent holds K:3 (from 4 level-1 cards purchased), leaving zero BLACK tokens available for acquisition. This creates a resource deadlock for high-prestige paths.

**NOBLE VIABILITY TEST:**
- N8 (W:3, B:3, G:3): Max achievable = W:2 (board W:1 + my W:1), BLOCKED short 1 WHITE
- N10 (R:3, W:3, K:3): Max achievable = K:1 (board K:0 + my K:1), BLOCKED short 2 BLACK
- N2 (G:4, R:4): Max achievable = G:3, R:3, BLOCKED short 1 GREEN and 1 RED

**CARD PURCHASE VIABILITY TEST:**
- L2_50 (2 prestige): Requires K:4 (with my WHITE:1 bonus, costs W:1, R:1, K:4 effective) → Board K:0, BLOCKED
- L2_63/64: Require G:5-6, board exhausted GREEN (only 1 left, can't accumulate +5-6), BLOCKED
- L2_66: Requires K:3 (my K:1 + board K:0) → BLOCKED
- Level 3 cards: All require either K:5-6 or G:7, all BLOCKED

**STRATEGIC CONCLUSION - Token Bottleneck is Real:**
Both nobles and high-prestige cards are gated by board token scarcity. The limiting resources are BLACK (consumed by opponent) and GREEN (depleted on board). Direct prestige paths are inaccessible this turn.

**OPTIMAL ACTION - RESERVE L2_50:**
1. **Claim GOLD Token**: Reserve action triggers +1 GOLD from board (board GOLD:4 available) → My GOLD becomes 2
2. **Insurance Position**: L2_50 enters reserved hand as contingency; when BLACK tokens eventually restock (via board refresh cycles), L2_50 becomes purchasable
3. **Board Refresh Trigger**: Removing L2_50 from board triggers Level 2 deck draw, potentially replacing with lower-cost card
4. **Wildcard Flexibility**: GOLD:2 tokens act as color substitutes for ANY gem (wildcards), reducing future rigid resource constraints
5. **Prestige Insurance**: Maintains 2-0 lead while adapting to board constraints; not forcing a suboptimal token take

**POST-RESERVE STATE:**
- Tokens: W:1, B:0, G:2, R:1, K:1, GOLD:2 (8/10 total)
- Reserved: L2_50 (2 prestige card, W:2/R:1/K:4 cost)
- Board: Refreshes Level 2 with new draw

**OPPONENT THREAT (TURN 11-12):**
Opponent can likely purchase L2_66 (B:3, R:2 effective with R:1 bonus, K:3) by turn 12, reaching 1 prestige. But this gives me turns 12-13 to acquire resources while maintaining prestige lead.

**TURN 12+ PROJECTION:**
With GOLD:2 available and L2_50 reserved:
- If board restocks BLACK: Purchase L2_50 immediately for +2 prestige (4-1 lead)
- If new Level 2 card is purchasable: Adapt and buy it
- Token accumulation with GOLD wildcards: Expand resource pool for nobles when board stabilizes

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ L2_50 is face-up on board (LEVEL_2, visible)
✓ Reserve action is legal (no token violations)
✓ GOLD:1 available on board (board shows GOLD:4)
✓ Token limit post-reserve: 8/10 (under cap)
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_50, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 (10 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1 (after previous purchase of L1_25 and now about to purchase L1_28, but note: in the current state, bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 — however, the reasoning history shows that the last intended action was to purchase L1_28, and the current token state matches the post-return state from turn 4: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3. Now, checking L1_28's cost: 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. My current bonuses: WHITE=1 covers the WHITE cost, GREEN=1 covers the GREEN cost, so I only need to pay 3 BLUE tokens — and I have exactly BLUE=3. Therefore, I can purchase L1_28. This gives me a second GREEN bonus (total GREEN=2), which is critical for high-value GREEN cards like L2_63 (5 GREEN) and L2_64 (6 GREEN), and brings me closer to Noble N8 (requires GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3 — with GREEN=2 bonus, I’ll only need 1 GREEN token). After purchase, my tokens become: WHITE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 (7 total), which is safe. This is the optimal move to strengthen my engine.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_28]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card L1_28 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I attempted to purchase L1_28 last turn, but the error indicates it is no longer on the board or in my reserved cards. Checking the current face-up cards, L1_28 is indeed absent — it must have been taken by the opponent or refreshed out. My current tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 (6 total). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. I need to pivot. My engine is strong in GREEN (bonus=2), so L2_63 (5 GREEN, 2 pts) and L2_64 (6 GREEN, 3 pts) are excellent targets. L2_63 costs 5 GREEN; with GREEN bonus=2, I need 3 GREEN tokens. I currently have 1 GREEN, so I need 2 more. The board has GREEN=1 token available — not enough to double (requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors. Available token counts: WHITE=1, BLUE=4, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=0. I cannot take BLACK (0). I need GREEN, so that's one. BLUE has 4 — I can double it, but do I need BLUE? Opponent has BLUE bonus and reserved L2_50 (which needs BLACK, not BLUE). I don’t currently need BLUE, but BLUE=4 is a rare opportunity to stockpile. However, my priority is GREEN for L2_63. Since GREEN=1 is the only GREEN available, I must take it as part of a trio. The other two colors: WHITE=1 and RED=2 are available, but I already have WHITE=2 tokens and WHITE bonus=1 — not urgent. RED=1 token, and I have RED bonus=1 — also not urgent. But I must choose two more. BLUE is abundant (4), and while not immediately needed, having BLUE could help with L2_66 (3 BLUE, 1 RED, 3 BLACK; I have RED bonus=1, BLACK=3 tokens — close). Alternatively, taking BLUE now sets up flexibility. So best legal move: take 1 GREEN (critical), 1 BLUE (abundant, future-proof), and 1 RED (available, and I have only 1 RED token). Total tokens after: 6+3=9 ≤10, no return needed. This gets me GREEN=2, closer to L2_63’s requirement of 3 GREEN tokens (with bonus=2, total 5).

======================================================================================

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **TURN 12 CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS**

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (7/10) ✓
- My prestige: 2 (opponent: 0, at token cap 10/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1
- Reserved: L2_50 (cost: W:2, R:1, K:4; prestige:2; bonus:BLUE)

**BOARD CRISIS & OPPORTUNITY:**
Board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:3
Critical observation: GREEN:0 and BLACK:0 on board. Opponent holds most of these. This creates a resource bottleneck EXCEPT for high GOLD availability (GOLD:3 remaining).

**L2_50 PURCHASE PATHWAY - NOW VIABLE:**
L2_50 costs W:2, R:1, K:4. I currently have:
- W:1 (need +1)
- R:1 (exactly what's needed)
- K:1, GOLD:2 (need K:3 more; can use 3 GOLD tokens as substitutes)

To maximize GOLD for K-substitution AND acquire missing gems:
- Take WHITE:1 (ONE only on board - take now or lose it)
- Take RED:1 (ONE only on board - secure it)
- Take GOLD:1 (board has 3, get this for total GOLD:3)

**POST-TOKEN STATE (PLANNED):**
After taking: W:2✓, B:0, G:2, R:2✓, K:1, GOLD:3

**NEXT TURN (TURN 13) LOCKED PURCHASE:**
Buy L2_50 from reserved:
- Payment: W:2✓ + R:1 (from R:2)✓ + K:1 + GOLD:3 (as K:3 substitutes)✓
- Result: Prestige 2→4 (I reach 4 prestige)
- New bonuses: WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 (from L2_54) + BLUE:1 (from L2_50) = W:1, B:2 (dual-BLUE multiplier unlocked!)
- Tokens remaining: W:0, B:0, G:2, R:1, K:0, GOLD:0 (3 tokens)

**OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT (TURN 12):**
Opponent at token cap (10/10). Must purchase a card this turn.
- Can buy L2_59 (W:3, G:2, R:3 → effective W:2, G:0, R:2 with bonuses)
- Will reach 1 prestige
- Expected prestige after my turn 13: Me 4, Opponent 1 = INSURMOUNTABLE 3-POINT LEAD

**RESOURCE SCARCITY GUARANTEE:**
Board WHITE:1 and RED:1 are consumable ONE-TIME resources.
- If I don't take RED:1 now, opponent blocks it with next turn purchase
- If I don't take WHITE:1 now, future token takes lose critical W access
- GOLD:3 redundant (unlikely exhausted); taking 1 GOLD is secure

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ Three different colors (WHITE, RED, GOLD)
✓ Board supply: W:1✓, R:1✓, GOLD:3✓
✓ Current 7/10 + taking 3 = 10/10 (legal, no returns)
✓ No board color constraint violations
✓ Sets up guaranteed L2_50 purchase next turn for prestige jump to 4

**STRATEGIC MOMENTUM:**
With prestige 4 by turn 13 vs opponent's 1, I control the endgame. Dual BLUE bonus (B:2) unlocks future card acceleration. Opponent cannot catch up from a 3-point prestige deficit with depleted board resources.

**DECISION FINALIZED:**
Take WHITE:1, RED:1, GOLD:1 to secure game-winning prestige engine.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: TURN 12 EXECUTION: Strategic Prestige Acquisition amid Resource Bottleneck

**CURRENT POSITION VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (7/10) ✓
- My prestige: 2 (opponent: 0) - maintaining 2-point advantage
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1 (dual synergy)
- Opponent position: 10/10 tokens at MAXIMUM CAPACITY, 0 prestige - opponent FORCED TO PURCHASE NEXT TURN
- Opponent tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:3

**CRITICAL BOARD STATE:**
Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0
- GREEN: 0 available (depleted)
- BLACK: 0 available (opponent hoarding K:3)
- This starves all high-prestige paths (nobles, L2_50, L2_66, L2_64)
- Token-taking is inefficient; must convert GOLD to prestige instead

**AVAILABLE IMMEDIATE PURCHASES:**
With GOLD:2 wildcard tokens:
- **L1_24 (cost GREEN:4)**: GREEN:2 + GOLD:2 = EXACT COST ✓
  - **Gain: +1 prestige (reach 3/15 victory)**
  - **Gain: +1 WHITE bonus (reach WHITE:2 total)**
- L1_5 (GREEN:2, RED:1): 0 prestige, wasteful
- L1_35: 0 prestige, only bonuses

**STRATEGIC RATIONALE - L1_24 IS OPTIMAL:**

1. **Prestige Acceleration**: Only immediately purchasable card granting prestige. Must seize every prestige point available.

2. **Bonus Amplification Breakthrough** - WHITE:2 bonus unlocks L2_50 efficiency:
   - L2_50 (reserved): costs WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:4
   - With WHITE:2 bonus, cost BECOMES: RED:1, BLACK:4 (WHITE requirement ELIMINATED)
   - Transforms L2_50 into almost-free prestige: only need RED:1 (current inventory) + BLACK:4 (farmable)
   - This is a SECRET POWER SPIKE enabling future 2-prestige purchase in 3-4 turns

3. **Token Capacity Liberation**: GOLD:2→0 frees inventory for next turn's 3-token acquisition (reaching 6/10 tokens for accumulation)

4. **Opponent Cascade Advantage**:
   - Opponent at 10/10 MUST buy card Turn 13
   - Likely opponents purchases: L1_24 (same card, uses their bonus), L1_35 (costs BLACK:2), or L1_5
   - If opponent buys L1_35 (uses BLACK:2) → BLACK:2 returns to board circulation
   - This enables Turn 14-15 BLACK accumulation toward L2_50 completion

**POST-PURCHASE STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (3/10) - Abundant refill capacity
- Prestige: **3/15 (20% of victory achieved)**
- Bonuses: **WHITE:2, BLUE:1** (multiplier synergy unlocked)
- Score advantage: **3-0 (opponent still 0 prestige)** - Unassailable psychological lead

**4-TURN COMPLETION PATH TO 5 PRESTIGE:**
- Turn 12 (NOW): L1_24 purchase → 3 prestige
- Turn 13: Take tokens (3 colors) → accumulate resources
- Turn 14: Take tokens again → reach BLACK:3-4 territory
- Turn 15: Purchase L2_50 with only RED:1 + BLACK:4 (WHITE requirement eliminated) → **5 prestige total**
- Remaining 10 prestige: Nobles (N8/N10/N2 = 3 each) or Level-2/3 cards (1-4 each)

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ L1_24 visible on board (LEVEL_1 face-up)
✓ Cost: GREEN:2 (from inventory) + GOLD:2 (from inventory) = GREEN:4 requirement exact match
✓ No token overage (GOLD converts to gem cost, not double-counted)
✓ Prestige award: +1 point (2→3)
✓ Bonus activated: WHITE:1→WHITE:2

======================================================================================

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (10 total). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. My primary goal is to purchase point-scoring cards or qualify for Nobles. With GREEN bonus=2, L2_63 (5 GREEN, 2 pts) and L2_64 (6 GREEN, 3 pts) are ideal targets. L2_63 costs 5 GREEN; with my bonus, I need only 3 GREEN tokens. I currently have 2 GREEN tokens, so I need 1 more. The board has GREEN=2 tokens available — excellent! However, I’m at 10 tokens, so I cannot take tokens without returning some. The rules require taking exactly 3 different colors or 2 of the same (if ≥4 available). GREEN has only 2 on board, so I cannot double it. Therefore, I must take 3 different colors and return 3 tokens to stay at 10. I need GREEN, so that’s one. The other two colors should be chosen to support other goals. BLUE has 3 on board — not enough to double, but I may need BLUE for L2_66 (3 BLUE, 1 RED, 3 BLACK; I have RED bonus=1 and BLACK=3 tokens, so I only need 3 BLUE — possible soon). WHITE is also useful for Noble N8 (requires WHITE=3; I have WHITE bonus=1 and WHITE=2 tokens, so I already meet that requirement for N8, but extra WHITE isn’t harmful). However, returning tokens is wasteful, so I should consider purchasing a card instead. Can I afford any card? L2_66 costs 3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK. My RED bonus covers 1 RED, so I need 3 BLUE, 1 RED, 3 BLACK. I have BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=3 — insufficient BLUE. L1_3 costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. My WHITE and RED bonuses cover 1 WHITE and 1 RED, so I need 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE. I have WHITE=2, BLUE=1 — insufficient BLUE. L1_5 costs 2 GREEN, 1 RED. My GREEN bonus=2 and RED bonus=1 cover the entire cost! I can purchase L1_5 for free (0 tokens). L1_5 gives a BLACK bonus, which helps with Noble N10 (needs BLACK=3; I currently have no BLACK bonus, so this would start that path) and L2_66/L3_75 (which require BLACK). Purchasing L1_5 is legal, costs nothing, reduces my token count by 0 (still 10), and gives a useful bonus. This is far better than taking/returning tokens. Why didn’t I see this earlier? L1_5 is face-up: cost {GREEN:2, RED:1}, my bonuses {GREEN:2, RED:1} — perfect match. This is the optimal move.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total = 10 tokens). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. I cannot take any tokens without returning some, as I’m at the 10-token limit. My strategic focus is on purchasing GREEN-based Level 2 cards: L2_63 (5 GREEN, 2 pts) and L2_64 (6 GREEN, 3 pts). With GREEN bonus=2, I need 3 GREEN tokens for L2_63 or 4 for L2_64. I currently have GREEN=2, so I need at least 1 more GREEN. The board has GREEN=2 available — not enough to double (requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors if I take tokens. However, I’m at 10 tokens, so taking 3 would require returning 3, which is inefficient unless it enables an immediate purchase. Let’s check affordable cards: L2_63 costs 5 GREEN; my bonus covers 2, so I need 3 GREEN tokens — I only have 2, so not yet affordable. L2_64 needs 4 GREEN tokens — also not affordable. L1_5 (BLACK bonus) costs 2 GREEN, 1 RED; my GREEN bonus=2 covers the 2 GREEN, and RED bonus=1 covers the 1 RED — so it’s FREE! But L1_5 gives a BLACK bonus, which I don’t urgently need (I already have BLACK=3 tokens, but no BLACK bonus). However, it’s a 0-point card that could slightly improve flexibility. More importantly, L1_35 costs 2 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 2 BLACK; my WHITE bonus=1 reduces WHITE cost to 1, GREEN bonus=2 covers the 1 GREEN, so I need 1 WHITE and 2 BLACK. I have WHITE=2 and BLACK=3 — so I can buy L1_35! It gives a RED bonus (I already have RED=1, making it RED=2), which helps with Noble N2 (needs RED=4, GREEN=4 — I have GREEN=2, RED=1 bonuses, so not yet close) and L2_59 (needs RED=3 — I’d then have RED=2 bonus). But L1_35 is 0 points, so is it worth it? Alternatively, I can return tokens to position for L2_63. But returning 3 tokens just to take 3 new ones is wasteful. Better: spend tokens. I can purchase L1_5 for free (cost fully covered by bonuses), which burns no tokens but gives a BLACK bonus. After that, I’d have bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1. Then I’d still have 10 tokens, but with a slightly better engine. However, L1_5 is on the board, and its cost is {GREEN:2, RED:1}. My GREEN bonus=2 covers GREEN:2, RED bonus=1 covers RED:1 — yes, fully covered. So I should PURCHASE L1_5 instead of taking tokens. But wait — the previous error was for an invalid token selection, meaning I likely submitted a token action with incorrect fields. However, upon re-evaluation, purchasing L1_5 is legal and productive. But let me double-check: current tokens are not needed for L1_5, since bonuses cover all costs. So PURCHASE_CARD is better. However, the current request is to correct the previous invalid token action. But given the state, the optimal move is to purchase L1_5. Yet the instruction says to re-analyze and provide a corrected response. Since I’m at 10 tokens, and L1_5 is affordable with bonuses alone, purchasing it is best. But if I must take tokens (e.g., if purchase wasn’t intended), the only legal token move is to take 3 different colors and return 3. But that’s inferior. Therefore, the correct action is to PURCHASE L1_5. However, looking back at the previous turn’s reasoning (turn 5), I concluded to take tokens, but that led to an invalid action (likely because I didn’t set the take_* fields properly). Now, with updated state, L1_5 is affordable. So I will purchase L1_5.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total = 10 tokens). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. I cannot take any tokens without returning some, as I’m at the 10-token limit. My priority is to buy point-generating cards. L2_63 (2 pts) costs 5 GREEN; with GREEN bonus=2, I need 3 GREEN tokens. I have 2 GREEN, so I need 1 more. L2_64 (3 pts) costs 6 GREEN; with bonus=2, I need 4 GREEN — too far. L2_59 (1 pt) costs 3 WHITE, 2 GREEN, 3 RED; with bonuses, I pay 2 WHITE, 0 GREEN, 2 RED — I have WHITE=2, RED=2, so I could afford it now! L2_59 is a legal purchase: cost after bonuses = WHITE max(0, 3−1)=2, GREEN max(0, 2−2)=0, RED max(0, 3−1)=2. I have WHITE=2, RED=2 — exactly enough. Purchasing L2_59 gives 1 point and a GREEN bonus (increasing GREEN to 3), which helps with L2_63/L2_64 and Noble N2 (needs GREEN=4, RED=4 — I’d have GREEN=3, RED=1 bonus + RED=2 tokens = 3 total RED, close). Why didn’t I see this before? It’s affordable right now and burns 4 tokens productively. This is better than taking/returning tokens. So I will PURCHASE L2_59.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.. Skipping turn.

======================================================================================

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: **TURN 13 CRITICAL DECISION ANALYSIS**

**CURRENT POSITION VERIFICATION:**
- My prestige: 3 (opponent: 0) - maintaining dominant 3-0 lead
- My tokens: WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (3/10) ✓ Ample capacity
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1 (locked in)
- Opponent tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:3 (10/10 - AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY)
- Opponent must take action now or face token violation

**OPPONENT PRESTIGE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**

Opponent's available prestige purchases:
- L2_63: GREEN:5 required (opponent has GREEN:2, SHORT 3) - BLOCKED
- L2_64: GREEN:6 required (opponent has GREEN:2, SHORT 4) - BLOCKED  
- L2_66: BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3 required (opponent has BLUE:1, SHORT 2 BLUE) - BLOCKED
- L2_59: WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3 required
  - With opponent bonuses (WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1): effective cost WHITE:2, GREEN:0 (covered), RED:2
  - Opponent HAS: WHITE:2✓, RED:2✓ = EXACT MATCH for payment
  - **L2_59 IS OPPONENT'S ONLY VIABLE PRESTIGE PURCHASE THIS TURN**

If left available, opponent WILL buy L2_59 on their turn 13, scoring 1 prestige (board becomes 3-1).

**STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES:**

**Option A: Take 3 tokens (BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1)**
- Outcome: My tokens become WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 (6/10)
- Allows opponent to buy L2_59 → board becomes 3-1, opponent momentum gained
- Gains diversified tokens but loses prestige advantage
- No immediate card purchases available (all remaining cards require 5+ gems, I only have 4+1 GOLD)

**Option B: Reserve L2_59 (CHOSEN)**
- **DEFENSIVE ADVANTAGE**: L2_59 removed from board, opponent can't claim prestige this turn
  - Opponent forced to buy 0-prestige card (L1_5: GREEN:2, RED:1 most likely) or reserve
  - Prestige maintains 3-0 heading into opponent's turn 13
  - **Prestige gap protected: Still 3-0 after opponent's action**

- **GOLD TOKEN WILDCARD**: Gain +1 GOLD from available board supply (GOLD:5 on board)
  - My tokens become: WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (4/10)
  - GOLD tokens substitute ANY color, enabling future adaptability for L2_50 (RED:1, BLACK:4 needed), L2_66, or nobles
  - GOLD:1 is equivalent to flexible +1 gem for any future purchase

- **BOARD REFRESH TRIGGER**: Removing L2_59 triggers deck draw, new LEVEL_2 card replaces it
  - Unknown card drawn but removes a locked prestige option from opponent's reach
  - Potential for new opportunities or at minimum denies opponent easy prestige path

- **TOKEN CAPACITY FOR NEXT TURN**: Only 4/10 tokens used, leaving 6/10 capacity
  - Next turn (turn 14) can take 3 more tokens or reserve another card
  - Abundance of options preserves flexibility

**VERIFICATION L2_59 AVAILABILITY:**
✓ L2_59 visible on board (LEVEL_2 face-up)
✓ Cost verifiable: WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3 (1 prestige reward)
✓ Creates opponent's only viable prestige outlet, worth blocking

**BOARD TOKEN SUPPLY:**
✓ GOLD:5 available for reservation reward (board shows GOLD:5)

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Prestige: 3 (opponent remains 0 after their forced non-prestige action)
- Tokens: WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (4/10, ready to expand)
- Reserved cards: L2_50 (2 prestige, RED:1 + BLACK:4), L2_59 (1 prestige, contingency)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1 (unchanged, locked)
- Opponent position: 10/10 forced to downsize, still 0 prestige, momentum blocked

**TURN 13-14 PROJECTION:**
- Turn 13 (my action): Reserve L2_59, gain GOLD:1
- Turn 13 (opponent): Forced to buy L1_5 (0 prestige) or similar, prestige stays 0
- Result: Maintain 3-0 lead with enhanced flexibility (GOLD token) and opponent momentum suppressed
- Turn 14+: With 4 reserved cards available (L2_50, L2_59) and GOLD wildcard, position to accumulate resources for high-prestige access or noble completion

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ L2_59 in face-up cards (LEVEL_2, visible)
✓ Reserve action legal (no token violations pre- or post-action)
✓ GOLD available on board (5 remaining)
✓ Token limit respected: 3/10 + 1 GOLD = 4/10 (well under cap)
✓ Card acquisition path: L2_59 enters reserved hand, available for future purchase or trading

**FINAL REASONING:**
Reserving L2_59 is SUPERIOR to taking tokens because it:
1. **Blocks opponent's ONLY prestige path** this turn (defensive dominance)
2. **Gains +1 GOLD wildcard** for future flexibility
3. **Triggers beneficial board refresh** (unknown LEVEL_2 card enters)
4. **Preserves 3-0 prestige lead** through opponent's forced non-prestige action
5. **Maintains abundant token capacity** (4/10, ready for next turn's 3-token take or card purchase)

This is a game-decisive move: maintaining an unassailable prestige lead while gaining resources and opponent options shrink.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_59, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total = 10 tokens). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. My primary goal is to purchase L2_63 (2 pts, GREEN bonus, cost: 5 GREEN). With my GREEN bonus=2, I need only 3 GREEN tokens to buy it. I currently have 2 GREEN tokens — just 1 short. The board shows GREEN=2 available, so I can get the needed GREEN, but I must take 3 different colors (since doubling requires ≥4, and GREEN=2 < 4). Available token colors on board: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=0. I cannot take BLACK (0 available). I need GREEN, so that’s one. Other options: BLUE=3 is abundant and useful for L2_62 (5 BLUE, 3 GREEN — I’d have GREEN=3 after taking 1 GREEN, so L2_62 would need 5 BLUE; I have 1 BLUE now) or L2_66 (3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK — but BLACK=0 on board and I have BLACK=3, though opponent has no BLACK bonus). WHITE=1 and RED=1 are low, and I already have ample WHITE=2 and RED=2 tokens plus bonuses. Since I’m at 10 tokens, taking 3 new tokens requires returning 2. I should return tokens I don’t need. BLACK=3 is excessive — no current GREEN/RED/WHITE cards require BLACK, and Noble N10 (RED=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3) is possible (I have RED=1, WHITE=1 bonuses → need 2 more each; BLACK=3 tokens meets N10’s BLACK=3). But L2_63 is more immediate (2 pts vs N10’s 3, but faster). BLACK tokens are less urgent than GREEN/BLUE. So I’ll take 1 GREEN (to reach 3, enough for L2_63), 1 BLUE (to build toward L2_62/L2_66), and 1 RED (only 1 available, but I have RED=2 tokens — acceptable). Then return 2 BLACK tokens (reducing from 3→1), which is safe since N10 is not immediate and no current cards need BLACK. After action: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=1 (10 total). This gives me exactly 3 GREEN tokens + GREEN=2 bonus = 5 GREEN to buy L2_63 next turn.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={BLACK=2}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 2
Reasoning: I currently hold tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total = 10 tokens). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. The previous move intended to take 1 GREEN, 1 BLUE, and 1 RED, but that would result in 13 tokens before returning, and the return instruction was insufficient—this led to an illegal move. Now, with 10 tokens, I cannot take any tokens without returning an equal number. However, returning tokens is inefficient, so I should instead look to purchase a card to reduce my token count productively. Reviewing affordable cards: L2_63 (2 pts) costs 5 GREEN. My GREEN bonus is 2, so I need 3 GREEN tokens. I have only 2 GREEN tokens — insufficient. L2_64 (3 pts) costs 6 GREEN — I’d need 4 tokens (6-2 bonus), but only have 2. L1_5 (0 pts, BLACK bonus) costs 2 GREEN, 1 RED. My GREEN bonus=2 covers the 2 GREEN, and RED bonus=1 covers the 1 RED — so this card is FREE! And it’s on the board. Purchasing L1_5 gives me a BLACK bonus, improving my BLACK bonus from 0 to 1, which helps with L2_66 (needs 3 BLACK) and Noble N10 (needs 3 BLACK). This is a perfect opportunity: spend 0 tokens to gain a bonus and reduce my token count indirectly (by not needing to hold as many). But wait—I must verify the cost: L1_5 cost is GREEN=2, RED=1. I have GREEN bonus=2 → covers GREEN cost fully. RED bonus=1 → covers RED cost fully. So yes, I can buy it with 0 tokens. However, I must confirm I have the card available: L1_5 is in LEVEL_1 face-up cards. So purchasing L1_5 is legal, costs nothing, gives me a BLACK bonus, and is far better than returning tokens. Therefore, I should PURCHASE L1_5.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I am player 0. My current tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. I cannot take any tokens without returning some, since I’m at the 10-token limit. My key goal is to buy point-scoring cards. L2_63 (2 pts) costs 5 GREEN; with GREEN bonus=2, I need 3 GREEN tokens. I currently have GREEN=2, so I need 1 more GREEN. L2_64 (3 pts) costs 6 GREEN → need 4 GREEN tokens (I have 2 → need 2 more). The board has GREEN=2 tokens available — not enough to double (requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors if I want GREEN. Available token counts: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=0. BLACK is unavailable (0), so any trio must be from WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED. I need GREEN, so that’s one. The other two should be chosen to enable future purchases while allowing me to return redundant tokens. I currently have excessive RED=2 and BLACK=3 (but BLACK is 0 on board). I also have WHITE=2 (with WHITE bonus=1), which is useful for Noble N8 (needs WHITE=3) and L3_75. BLUE=3 on board is high — and I only have BLUE=1 token. BLUE is needed for L2_66 (3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK; I have RED bonus=1, so need 1 RED + 3 BLUE + 3 BLACK — I have BLACK=3, RED=2 → could buy if I get 2 more BLUE). Also, Noble N8 requires BLUE=3 — I have 1 BLUE token, so need 2 more. So BLUE is valuable. Thus, the best trio to take is GREEN (for L2_63/L2_64), BLUE (for N8/L2_66), and WHITE (for N8/L3_75). That’s 1 GREEN, 1 BLUE, 1 WHITE. But I’m at 10 tokens, so taking 3 means I must return 3 to stay at 10. Which tokens to return? I have RED=2 and BLACK=3 — both are less critical right now. I have RED bonus=1, and no immediate card requires extra RED beyond that. BLACK is needed for L2_66 and N10, but I already have 3 BLACK tokens — that’s enough for L2_66 (needs 3 BLACK; my RED bonus covers 1 RED, so I’d need 3 BLUE + 1 RED + 3 BLACK — I have RED=2, BLACK=3, so if I get BLUE=3, I can buy it). So I don’t need to keep all 3 BLACK. However, returning RED is safer: I only need RED=1 token for most purposes (since I have RED bonus=1), and I have RED=2. Also, BLACK=3 is a strong holding for L2_66 or future BLACK cards. So I’ll return 2 RED and 1 BLACK (or 3 RED/BLACK total). But I only have RED=2, so max return RED=2. So return 2 RED and 1 BLACK. After action: Take GREEN=1 (→3), BLUE=1 (→2), WHITE=1 (→3); Return RED=2 (→0), BLACK=1 (→2). Final tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=2 (10 total). This gives me GREEN=3 → with bonus=2, total GREEN=5 → enough for L2_63 (5 GREEN) next turn! Also, WHITE=3 and BLUE=2 gets me closer to Noble N8 (needs WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=3 — I’ll have all three after buying L2_63). This is highly efficient.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn={RED=2, BLACK=1}]

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 14: STRATEGIC TOKEN ACCUMULATION TOWARD L2_50 COMPLETION

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My prestige: 3 (opponent: 0) - maintaining dominant 3-0 lead
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (4/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1 (locked in)
- My reserved: L2_50 (2 prestige, costs WHITE:2+RED:1+BLACK:4 → effectively RED:1+BLACK:4 with WHITE:2 bonus), L2_59 (1 prestige, backup)
- Opponent: 9/10 tokens (decremented from Turn 13), 0 prestige (attempting recovery)

**AVAILABLE BOARD RESOURCES:**
Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:4
- Critical constraint: WHITE:0 blocks direct noble accumulation
- BLACK:1 is scarce and critical for L2_50 (need 4 total, have 1)
- RED:3 available (supports L2_50 and multiple future paths)
- BLUE:2 available (unlocks card flexibility)

**IMMEDIATE PURCHASE ANALYSIS:**
No cards immediately affordable:
- L2_50 (reserved): Needs only RED:1✓ + BLACK:4✗ (have 1, need 3 more)
- L2_66: Requires BLUE:3✗, RED:2✗, BLACK:3✗
- All Level 3 cards: Require 5-7 gems, far out of reach
- L2_62: Requires BLUE:5/GREEN:3 (BLUE:4 with my bonus, need 4 more)

**4-TURN PROJECTION TO L2_50 VICTORY:**

1. **Turn 14 (NOW)**: Take BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1
   - Tokens: W:1, B:1, G:0, R:2, K:2, GOLD:1 (7/10)
   - Achievement: Progress on BLACK accumulation, build RED/BLUE diversity

2. **Turn 15-16**: Take 2 more sets of tokens (BLACK:1 when available, RED:1, GOLD/other)
   - Target: Reach BLACK:3, RED:3, with GOLD:2 or similar token base
   - Tokens trajectory: ~9-10 total by Turn 16

3. **Turn 17**: PURCHASE L2_50
   - Payment: RED:1 (spend from R:3) + BLACK:3 (spend from K:3) + GOLD:1 (as wildcard for 4th BLACK)
   - Prestige gained: +2 (reach 5/15)
   - Bonus gained: +BLUE:1 (reach WHITE:2, BLUE:2 dual synergy)

**WHY BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (NOT GOLD:2)?**

1. **BLACK is Scarce & Time-Sensitive**:
   - Board has BLACK:1 available NOW (only source per turn cycle)
   - L2_50 requires BLACK:4; deferring this turn's BLACK:1 delays prestige by a full turn
   - Opponent could interfere or board state could change

2. **RED Supports Multiple Paths**:
   - L2_50 needs RED:1 (immediate)
   - Alternative routes (N10: RED:3, N2: RED:4) need RED accumulation
   - RED:3 available; securing 1 now is efficient

3. **BLUE Unlocks Future Flexibility**:
   - With BLUE:1 added, I reach BLUE:1 token pool
   - My BLUE:1 bonus means future BLUE-heavy cards cost less
   - L2_62 (BLUE:5, GREEN:3 → BLUE:4 with my bonus) becomes a viable 2-prestige option

4. **GOLD Already Sufficient**:
   - I have GOLD:1; adding GOLD:2 would give GOLD:3 total
   - GOLD tokens are wildcards but don't address BLACK scarcity
   - Better strategy: Lock in scarce gems (BLACK, RED, BLUE) now; use GOLD:1-3 as substitutes later

**TOKEN LIMIT VERIFICATION:**
- Current: 4/10 tokens
- Taking: BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (exactly 3, all different colors)
- After: 7/10 tokens (well under 10 cap)
- No returns needed ✓

**OPPONENT THREAT (TURN 14):**
Opponent at 9/10 tokens must act. Analysis:
- Cannot afford any prestige card (all 1+ prestige cards need 3+ gems; opponent short on colors)
- Likely purchases L1_5 (GREEN:2, RED:1) or L1_3 (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1) to free tokens
- Prestige remains 0 after opponent's turn 14

**POST-ACTION STATUS:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (7/10)
- Prestige: 3/15 (20% of victory)
- Prestige lead: 3-0 (unassailable)
- Next milestone: 5 prestige (L2_50 purchase in 3 turns) → 2-0 multiplier toward 10+ prestige via subsequent nobles

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ Exactly 3 tokens of 3 different colors (BLUE, RED, BLACK)
✓ All colors available on board (BLUE:2, RED:3, BLACK:1)
✓ Token capacity: 7/10 ≤ 10 maximum
✓ Action fields match strategy
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=2 (10 total) and bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. The card L2_63 costs 5 GREEN and gives 2 prestige points. With my GREEN bonus of 2, I only need to pay 3 GREEN tokens — and I have exactly 3 GREEN tokens available. This purchase is fully affordable and immediately yields 2 points. After buying L2_63, my GREEN tokens will drop to 0, freeing up space and bringing my total tokens to 7 (well under 10). Additionally, purchasing L2_63 gives me a third GREEN bonus (now GREEN=3), which immediately qualifies me for Noble N8 (requires GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3). I currently have WHITE=3 and BLUE=2 tokens, and WHITE bonus=1, BLUE bonus=0. While I don’t yet meet N8’s BLUE requirement (need BLUE=3 total; I have 2 tokens), I’m very close — and N8 will likely trigger next turn if I get 1 more BLUE. Buying L2_63 is the optimal move: it scores points immediately, upgrades my GREEN bonus to 3, and sets up a Noble visit next turn. No other card is as affordable or impactful right now (L2_64 needs 6 GREEN → 4 tokens, I only have 3; L2_66 needs 3 BLUE + 2 RED + 3 BLACK — I have RED=0 and only 2 BLUE). Thus, I purchase L2_63.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 15: NOBLE N2 ACCELERATION PATH - Securing 3-Prestige Victory

**CURRENT STATE:**
- My prestige: 3/15 (opponent: 2/15) - maintaining 1-point lead
- My tokens: W:1, B:1, G:0, R:2, K:2, GOLD:1 (7/10) ✓ Capacity available
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1 (locked in)
- My reserved: L2_50 (R:1+K:4 effective), L2_59 (backup)

**CRITICAL RESOURCE STATE:**
Board tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:4

**KEY CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:**
- BLACK:0 on board blocks L2_50 accumulation (requires K:4, I have K:2, can't access BLACK)
- L2_50 path is STALLED this turn and next until board refreshes
- WHITE:0 on board blocks N8 (W:3 requirement) and N10 partially (W:3 requirement)
- GREEN:4 and RED:2 ARE AVAILABLE → N2 is accessible!

**IMMEDIATE PURCHASE ANALYSIS:**
No prestige cards immediately affordable. All cards require 3-5+ gems in multiple colors. Even with GOLD wildcards, I'd need suboptimal token conversions. Better to accumulate toward nobles.

**NOBLE VIABILITY TEST:**

**N2 (3 prestige): G:4, R:4**
- Currently have: G:0, R:2
- Deficit: G:+4, R:+2 (6 tokens total)
- Board supplies: G:4✓ (entire stack), R:2✓ (entire stack) = 6 tokens exact!
- **3-TURN COMPLETION PATH:**
  - Turn 15 (NOW): Take GREEN:2 → G:2, R:2 (halfway there)
  - Turn 16: Take GREEN:1 + RED:1 + other color → G:3, R:3 (nearly complete)
  - Turn 17: Take GREEN:1 + RED:1 + other color → G:4✓, R:4✓ → **VISIT N2 FOR +3 PRESTIGE**
  - **Prestige trajectory: 3 → 6/15 (40% of victory in 3 turns)**

**N10 (3 prestige): R:3, W:3, K:3**
- Currently have: R:2, W:1, K:2
- Deficit: R:+1, W:+2, K:+1
- Board supplies: R:2✓, W:0✗, K:0✗
- BLOCKED: Cannot access required WHITE and BLACK tokens (both 0 on board)

**N8 (3 prestige): G:3, B:3, W:3**
- Currently have: G:0, B:1, W:1
- Deficit: G:+3, B:+2, W:+2
- Board supplies: G:4✓, B:1✗, W:0✗
- BLOCKED: Insufficient BLUE and WHITE available

**WHY GREEN:2 (NOT 3-COLOR TOKEN):**

1. **Direct Prestige Path**: GREEN:2 purchase advances N2 completion by ~40% immediately (2 of 4 GREEN tokens secured)

2. **Resource Efficiency**: Taking GREEN:2 uses board's most abundant resource (GREEN:4) and aligns with N2's G:4 requirement. This is resource-optimal.

3. **Alternative 3-color options underperform**:
   - BLUE:1 + GREEN:1 + RED:1 → B:2, G:1, R:3 (fragmented progress across multiple nobles, no clear path)
   - GREEN:1 + RED:1 + GOLD:1 → Same fragmentation issue
   - None unlock immediate card purchases (all remaining cards require 5+ gems or problematic color combinations)

4. **Token Capacity Preserved**: After taking GREEN:2, tokens become 8/10, leaving 2-token capacity for next turn's action

5. **Opponent Momentum**: Opponent at 2 prestige will struggle to catch up if I reach 6 prestige (4-point lead) within 3 turns. Opponent token pool (7/10) and color distribution (W:3, B:2, K:2, R:0, G:0) make prestige accumulation difficult.

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: W:1, B:1, G:2, R:2, K:2, GOLD:1 (8/10)
- Prestige: 3/15 (20% of victory, maintaining lead)
- Progress toward N2: 50% complete (2 GREEN acquired, 2 RED acquired)
- Next 2 turns: Acquire G:2 more + R:2 more (both available on board) → N2 completion

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ Taking GREEN:2 (same color, requires 4+ available, board has 4✓)
✓ Token limit: 7/10 + 2 = 8/10 ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No returns needed
✓ Legal token acquisition

**STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:**
This move transitions from defensive prestige protection to OFFENSIVE prestige accumulation. By turn 17, I reach 6 prestige (40% of victory). Opponent remains at 2 prestige. This creates an unassailable 4-point gap that opponent cannot close before I accumulate remaining 9 prestige via additional nobles or Level 3 cards.

**DECISION: Take GREEN:2 to initiate N2 (3-prestige) completion in 3 turns.**
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with current tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=2 (total = 7). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. I just purchased L2_63, which gave me a third GREEN bonus, qualifying me for Noble N8 (requires GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3). I currently have WHITE=3 and BLUE=2 tokens, so I need 1 more BLUE token to trigger N8 next turn. The board shows available tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=4. BLUE has only 1 token available — not enough to double (requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors. I need BLUE, so that’s one. The other two colors must be from GREEN or RED (WHITE and BLACK are 0 on board). I have no immediate need for GREEN or RED tokens (GREEN bonus=3 covers all GREEN costs; RED bonus=1 is sufficient for most needs), but I must take two more to satisfy the 3-different-color rule. GREEN=2 and RED=2 are available. Taking GREEN and RED is harmless and keeps my options open (e.g., L2_64 needs more GREEN, but I don’t have enough tokens for it yet). After taking 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, my tokens will be: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 (total = 10), which is legal. Crucially, BLUE=3 + WHITE=3 + GREEN bonus=3 now meets Noble N8’s requirement — so after this turn, I will receive N8’s 3 prestige points on my next turn (or immediately if the game checks after token actions, but typically Nobles are awarded after purchases/reserves; regardless, having BLUE=3 ensures I can trigger N8 soon). This is the optimal path to accelerate my score toward 15.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current tokens: W:1, B:1, G:2, R:2, K:2, GOLD:1 (9/10). I have L2_59 in my reserved hand, costing WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3 and providing +1 prestige plus GREEN bonus. Cost analysis with my WHITE:2 bonus: Effective cost = WHITE:1 (reduced from 3), GREEN:2, RED:3. Available payment: WHITE:1✓, GREEN:2✓, RED:2 + GOLD:1 (as RED wildcard)✓. This purchase closes an immediate prestige gap. After purchasing L2_59: prestige 3→4 (2-point lead over opponent's 2), gain +1 GREEN bonus (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1), and free token inventory (9/10→3/10). This is superior to taking GOLD:1 because: (1) Secures prestige THIS turn vs. next turn, (2) Unlocks flexibility with low token count for future accumulation, (3) GREEN bonus enables future access to L2_64 (3 prestige, GREEN:6 cost) and other GREEN-heavy plays. Opponent at 10/10 tokens cannot afford any prestige cards; forced to buy 0-prestige Level 1 card, so no immediate threat. Critical resource scarcity on board (only G:1, R:1, GOLD:4 available) makes this guaranteed prestige conversion essential before further board starvation.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 (total=10), and bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. My total score is 2 (from L2_63). Noble N8 requires GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3 — and I now meet all three requirements (WHITE=3 tokens + bonus=1 ≥3, BLUE=3 tokens, GREEN bonus=3). Therefore, I will receive Noble N8’s 3 points immediately after this turn (Nobles are awarded at the end of a turn if requirements are met). That brings my projected score to 5. Now, I must choose my action. I cannot take tokens (at 10 limit), so only valid options are RESERVE or PURCHASE. Can I purchase any card? L2_64 costs 6 GREEN → with GREEN bonus=3, need 3 GREEN tokens; I only have GREEN=1 → insufficient. L2_66 costs 3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK. My bonuses: RED=1 reduces RED cost to 1. So effective cost: 3 BLUE, 1 RED, 3 BLACK. I have BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2 → short 1 BLACK. Not affordable. L2_62 costs 5 BLUE + 3 GREEN → too expensive. L2_69 costs 5 BLACK → I have only 2. Level 3 cards are even more expensive. So no purchase possible. Therefore, I should reserve a high-value card to secure it and gain a gold token (GOLD=5 available). Top candidates: L2_66 (1 pt, but enables future engine and possibly N10), L2_64 (3 pts, but needs 3 more GREEN tokens), or a Level 3 like L3_75 (3 pts, requires WHITE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=5 — I have WHITE=3, GREEN=1+bonus=4, RED=1+bonus=2, BLACK=2 → far from affordable). L2_66 is strategically valuable: it gives RED bonus (I’d have RED=2), and with my current holdings (BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2), if I get 1 more BLACK, I can buy it next turn. Also, opponent has reserved L2_50 (needs BLACK), so BLACK may become scarce. Reserving L2_66 blocks opponent and sets up a near-term purchase. I get 1 gold token, which helps with future odd-cost cards. This is better than reserving blind from a deck. So I reserve L2_66.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_66, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. My score is 2. I previously attempted to take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED, but that would have brought me from 7 to 10 tokens — however, the game engine flagged an error: 'Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0'. This implies I accidentally triggered a RESERVE_CARD action (which grants a gold token) instead of a pure TAKE_TOKENS. That was my mistake: I must ensure the action_type is TAKE_TOKENS and no gold is received. Now, reviewing the current state: I already have BLUE=3, WHITE=3, and GREEN bonus=3 — which fully satisfies Noble N8’s requirement (GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3). Nobles are awarded at the end of a turn if requirements are met *after* the action. So if I do nothing that disrupts this, I should receive N8’s 3 points immediately after this turn — but only if I perform a valid action that leaves my bonuses and token totals meeting the requirement. However, I am currently at 10 tokens, so I cannot take more without returning. But I don’t need to take tokens! I already have BLUE=3, so N8 should trigger. Yet, the game doesn’t auto-award Nobles until after a valid action. My best move is to purchase a card to reduce token count and potentially score more, or reserve — but let’s check affordability. L2_64 costs 6 GREEN; with GREEN bonus=3, I need 3 GREEN tokens — I only have 1, so not affordable. L2_66 costs 3 BLUE, 2 RED, 3 BLACK; I have BLUE=3, RED=1 (plus RED bonus=1 → covers 1 RED, so need 1 more RED), BLACK=2 (need 3 → short 1). Not affordable. L3_75 costs 3 WHITE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED, 5 BLACK — I lack GREEN, RED, BLACK. L1 cards: L1_3 costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED — I have WHITE=3, BLUE=3, RED=1 → affordable! But it gives BLACK bonus, which I don’t need, and 0 points. Alternatively, I can simply take no new tokens, but I must make a move. Since I’m at 10 tokens, the only safe non-purchase actions are: (a) reserve a card (but that gives a gold token, pushing me to 11 tokens — illegal unless I return one), or (b) take tokens with returns. But I already qualify for N8 — so the best action is to purchase an affordable card to burn tokens and keep my N8 eligibility. Wait: purchasing a card doesn’t affect bonuses or the noble condition — and I’m already eligible. So I should prioritize purchasing if possible. Rechecking L1_3: cost WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1. My bonuses don’t help (no BLUE or RED bonus beyond what’s needed). I have WHITE=3, BLUE=3, RED=1 — exactly enough. Buying L1_3 gives a BLACK bonus (now BLACK=1), costs no gold, and reduces tokens to WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=0, GREEN=1, BLACK=2 (5 total). This is safe, and I still have GREEN=3, WHITE=1 (plus WHITE bonus=1 → total WHITE=2? No — noble requirements are based on *bonuses only*, not tokens! Critical correction: Nobles depend ONLY on the number of bonus gems from purchased cards, not tokens held. I have GREEN bonus=3, BLUE bonus=0, WHITE bonus=1. Oh no! I misunderstood earlier. My BLUE bonus is 0 — I only have BLUE tokens, not BLUE bonus cards. Noble N8 requires: GREEN=3, BLUE=3, WHITE=3 in *bonuses*, not tokens. I have GREEN bonus=3 (from 3 GREEN cards), WHITE bonus=1 (from L1_21), RED bonus=1 (from L1_34 and L1_25 gives GREEN, L2_63 gives GREEN). So BLUE bonus=0. Therefore, I do NOT qualify for N8. My earlier assumption was wrong — tokens don’t count for nobles, only bonuses. This changes everything. So I do NOT get N8. My actual bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. To get N8, I need 2 more BLUE bonuses and 2 more WHITE bonuses — very far. So N8 is not imminent. My highest priority is scoring points. My options: L2_64 (3 pts, 6 GREEN cost). With GREEN bonus=3, I need 3 GREEN tokens. I currently have GREEN=1. The board has GREEN=3 tokens — but I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return if I take. I need 2 more GREEN. I cannot double GREEN (only 3 on board; doubling requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors including GREEN. Available tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, others 0. So I can take GREEN, WHITE, RED. But I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return 3. Which to return? I have BLACK=2, RED=1, WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1. I don’t need BLACK right now (no BLACK bonuses except possibly later), and BLUE=3 is excess (no BLUE costs soon). L2_62 costs 5 BLUE + 3 GREEN — I have GREEN bonus=3, so need 0 GREEN tokens, but 5 BLUE tokens — I have 3, so need 2 more BLUE — but BLUE=0 on board, so impossible. So BLUE is useless right now. Best to return BLUE and BLACK. Plan: Take 1 GREEN, 1 WHITE, 1 RED (to get GREEN up). Return 2 BLUE and 1 BLACK (since BLUE and BLACK are least useful). After: GREEN=2, WHITE=4, RED=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=1 (10 total). Then next turn, take 1 more GREEN (if available) to have GREEN=3 → buy L2_64 (needs 3 GREEN tokens, bonus=3 → total 6). So current move: take GREEN, WHITE, RED; return BLUE=2, BLACK=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=2, BLACK=1}]

======================================================================================

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 17 CRITICAL PRESTIGE CONVERSION - IMMEDIATE 50% VICTORY MILESTONE

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (3/10 tokens)
- My prestige: 4/15 (opponent: 2/15) - maintaining 2-point advantage
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 (triple synergy locked)
- Opponent position: 10/10 tokens (AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY) - forced to act this turn

**BOARD RESOURCE STATE:**
Available tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5
Immediate prestige cards:
- **L2_66: BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3 (1 prestige, RED bonus)** ← CRITICAL DISCOVERY
- L2_64: GREEN:6 (3 prestige) - unreachable
- L2_62: BLUE:5, GREEN:3 (2 prestige) - unreachable
- L2_69: BLACK:5 (2 prestige) - unreachable

**BREAKTHROUGH REALIZATION - L2_66 IS IMMEDIATELY PURCHASABLE:**

L2_66 cost breakdown: BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3

My exact payment capability:
- BLUE: My BLUE:1 + board BLUE:2 = 3 total ✓
- RED: My RED:0 + board RED:2 = 2 total ✓  
- BLACK: My BLACK:2 + board BLACK:1 = 3 total ✓

**EXACT TOKEN MATCH FOR PAYMENT - THIS CARD IS PURCHASABLE NOW!**

**STRATEGIC RATIONALE - PURCHASE L2_66 IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Prestige Milestone Achievement**: +1 prestige secures 4→5/15 (EXACTLY 50% of victory threshold)
   - Transitions game from early-stage (4/15) to mid-game decisiveness (5/15)
   - Opponent needs 5+ prestige to tie at 10, currently only has 2
   - Creates game-decisive prestige advantage

2. **Prestige Cushion Expansion**: Board becomes 5-2 (opponent stays at 2)
   - Currently 2-point advantage (4-2) becomes 3-point advantage (5-2)
   - After opponent's forced turn (likely reserve for GOLD, stays at 0 prestige gain), gap widens
   - Opponent cannot score prestige this turn (at 10/10 tokens, only affordable cards are L1_5/L1_10 = 0 prestige)

3. **Bonus Cascade Unlock - RED:1 Bonus Acquired**:
   - New bonus state: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (quad synergy)
   - Enables future L2_50 completion (RED:1 cost reduction applied separately)
   - Unlocks nobleman N10 viability (RED:3 easier to target with RED:1 bonus)

4. **Token Inventory COMPLETE RESET**:
   - Before: 3/10 tokens (constrained capacity)
   - After: 0/10 tokens (MAXIMUM capacity for next turn)
   - Turn 18: Can take 3-token + 2-token combinations (10 tokens total achievable)
   - Prepares for late-game aggressive accumulation toward nobles/Level-3 cards

5. **Opponent Forced Into Suboptimal Action**:
   - Opponent at 10/10 cannot take tokens (capacity full)
   - Opponent cannot purchase prestige card (L2_64 costs GREEN:6 with GREEN:3 bonus = effective GREEN:3, but hold only GREEN:2 = SHORT 1)
   - Opponent must either: (A) Reserve card for GOLD, or (B) Buy 0-prestige L1 card
   - Prestige remains 2 after opponent's turn either way
   - **I gain prestige, opponent blocked from prestige this turn = gap expands 4-2 → 5-2**

**REJECTED ALTERNATIVE: TOKEN ACCUMULATION (SUBOPTIMAL)**

If I took 3 tokens (e.g., BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1):
- Would reach 6/10 tokens
- Could NOT purchase any card next turn (all remaining cards require 3-5+ gems)
- Prestige remains 4 while opponent potentially scores (after opponent's reserve + next turn purchase)
- Gap shrinks, momentum lost
- Defers guaranteed prestige by 1-2 turns minimum

**POST-PURCHASE ENDGAME TRAJECTORY:**

After L2_66 purchase:
- Prestige: 5/15 (50% milestone, only 5 more needed for victory)
- Prestige lead: 5-2 (3-point cushion, unassailable in 3-4 remaining turns)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (maximum synergy)
- Tokens: 0/10 (reset for aggressive accumulation)

Paths to victory from 5 prestige:
- Path A: L2_50 (2 prestige) + N2 (3 prestige) = 10 total
- Path B: Two nobles (3+3 = 6, then one Level-2 card = 8+, then another noble/card)
- Path C: L2_64 (3 prestige with future GREEN:1 bonus play) + nobles

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ L2_66 visible on board (LEVEL_2 face-up, not reserved, not purchased)
✓ Card ID: L2_66 ✓
✓ Cost: BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:3
✓ Payment sources verified: BLUE:1+2=3 ✓, RED:0+2=2 ✓, BLACK:2+1=3 ✓
✓ Prestige award: +1 (4→5) ✓
✓ Bonus activation: RED:1 ✓
✓ No token violations

**FINAL DECISION:**
Purchase L2_66 to secure the 50% prestige milestone NOW, consolidate an unassailable 3-point prestige lead, unlock RED bonus synergy, and reset token capacity for decisive late-game accumulation. This is the game-decisive turn.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_66]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_66
Reasoning: TURN 17: CRITICAL RESOURCE ACCUMULATION FOR L2_50 COMPLETION

**CURRENT POSITION VERIFICATION:**
- My prestige: 4/15 (opponent: 2/15) - maintaining 2-point advantage
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (3/10) ✓ High capacity available
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 (triple synergy locked)
- My reserved: L2_50 (costs W:2+R:1+K:4 → effective R:1+K:4 with WHITE:2 bonus)
- Opponent: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 (10/10 MAXED OUT)

**BOARD STATE:**
Available tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

**IMMEDIATE CARD AFFORDABILITY CHECK:**
No face-up cards are currently purchasable with my 3 tokens:
- L1_3, L1_35, L1_5, L1_10: all require 2-4 gems, I'm short on multiple colors
- L2_64, L2_66, L2_62, L2_69: all require 3-6 gems, insufficient inventory
- L3 cards: require 3+ gems each, completely out of reach
- L2_50 (reserved): needs R:1✓(0) + K:4✗(have 2) = missing K:2 still

**WINNING PATH ANALYSIS:**

**L2_50 (Reserved Card) - 2 PRESTIGE PATH:**
- Current requirement: R:1✓, K:4 (need K:1 more)
- After taking RED:1, BLACK:1: R:1✓, K:3 (need K:0.5 = just need 1 more token)
- This is achievable in 2-3 turns, giving 6 prestige total (40% of victory)
- Most direct path to prestige

**Alternative Paths (Blocked):**
- Nobles N2/N8/N10: All require WHITE:3+ tokens, but WHITE:0 on board → IMPOSSIBLE
- L2_64 (3 prestige, G:6): Board has G:2 only, far away
- L2_69 (2 prestige, K:5): Have K:2, need K:3 more, 2-3 turns away

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1**

**Why this 3-token combination:**
1. **RED:1 IS CRITICAL**: L2_50 needs R:1. Currently R:0. This is 50% of the problem solved this turn.
2. **BLACK:1 MAXIMIZES PROGRESS**: Gets K:3 (from K:2+1), leaving only K:1 remaining for L2_50. One more BLACK on next turn or turn 19 = completion!
3. **BLUE:1 STRATEGIC**: My BLUE:1 bonus unlocks BLUE-heavy future plays (L2_62 becomes more efficient, future BLUE cards)
4. **DIVERSIFICATION**: Prevents over-concentration in one color, maintains flexibility for other plays

**Why NOT alternatives:**
- GOLD:2 (wildcards): Doesn't address the specific RED:1 or BLACK:2 gap for L2_50; GOLD is less directed
- Taking only 2 tokens or taking 3 of same color: Legally possible but slower progress

**TOKEN LIMIT VERIFICATION:**
- Current: 3/10
- Taking: BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (exactly 3 different colors) ✓
- After: 3 + 3 = 6/10 tokens (well under 10 cap) ✓
- No returns needed ✓
- Board has BLUE:2✓, RED:2✓, BLACK:1✓ (all available) ✓

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: W:0, B:2, G:0, R:1, K:3, GOLD:0 (6/10)
- Prestige: 4/15 (unchanged this turn, but set up for +2 next critical turn)
- L2_50 progress: 97% complete (only need K:1 more from board)
- Next window: Turn 18-19, acquire K:1 → PURCHASE L2_50 for 2 prestige → 6/15 total

**OPPONENT THREAT (TURN 17):**
Opponent at 10/10 tokens MUST purchase or reserve next turn. Likely action: Buy L1_5 (with GREEN bonus, costs just R:1 effectively), freeing 2 tokens. This triggers natural board refresh, which may bring more BLACK/RED tokens, further supporting my accumulation strategy.

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ Exactly 3 tokens of 3 different colors (BLUE, RED, BLACK)
✓ Token action format: take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1, take_BLACK=1
✓ All colors available on board
✓ No token overage or returns
✓ Card acquisition path clear: L2_50 completion imminent

**STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:**
This move executes the final resource accumulation phase before high-prestige conversion. L2_50 is 97% ready; one more BLACK token enables +2 prestige conversion. Combined with opponent still at 2 prestige, this creates an unassailable 4+ point gap by turn 19. Victory path: 4→6→9+ prestige via L2_50 + nobles/level-3 cards.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. My score is 2. My top priority is to buy L2_64 (3 pts), which costs 6 GREEN. With GREEN bonus=3, I need 3 GREEN tokens. I currently have GREEN=2, so I need 1 more GREEN. The board shows GREEN=2 tokens available — not enough to double (requires ≥4), so I must take 3 different colors including GREEN. Available token colors: BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1 (WHITE=0, BLACK=0). So I must take GREEN, BLUE, and RED. But I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return 3 tokens to stay at 10. Which tokens to return? I have WHITE=4 (excess; WHITE bonus=1 covers most WHITE costs), BLACK=1 (low utility now), and only 1 BLUE (so I shouldn’t return BLUE). Best to return WHITE tokens, which are abundant. I’ll return 3 WHITE tokens. After action: Take GREEN=1 (→3), BLUE=1 (→2), RED=1 (→3); Return WHITE=3 (→1). Final tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=1 (10 total). Now I have GREEN=3 → with bonus=3, total GREEN=6 → enough to buy L2_64 next turn for 3 points. This is the most efficient path to increase my score.

- Opponent: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:1 (10/10 MAXED OUT - FORCED ACTION)

**BOARD TOKEN AVAILABILITY:**
Available to take: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0
- Only 2 colors available for standard token acquisition
- Completely depleted of BLUE, RED, BLACK (opponent controls token distribution)

**TOKEN ACQUISITION IMPOSSIBILITY VERIFICATION:**

**Option A: Three different colors (1 each)?**
- Requires 3 distinct colors
- Available: WHITE:3✓, GREEN:1✓, and... ONLY 2 colors exist
- INVALID: Cannot form 3-color combination ✗

**Option B: Two tokens of same color (requires 4+ on board)?**
- WHITE:3 available < 4 required minimum = INVALID
- GREEN:1 available < 4 required minimum = INVALID
- All others (BLUE, RED, BLACK): 0 available = INVALID ✗

**CONCLUSION:** Standard TAKE_TOKENS action is IMPOSSIBLE given board constraint. Must pursue RESERVE_CARD as only viable action.

**RESERVATION STRATEGY - CARD SELECTION: L2_69 (2 prestige, BLACK:5)**

**Why L2_69 (not L2_64, L2_62, L2_66, or L3)?**

1. **Closest Path to Completion**:
   - Current inventory: BLACK:3
   - L2_69 requirement: BLACK:5 (SHORT only BLACK:2)
   - Comparison:
     - **L2_64 (GREEN:6)**: Have GREEN:0, need all 6 → 6-turn accumulation
     - **L2_62 (BLUE:5+GREEN:3)**: Have BLUE:2, GREEN:0, need BLUE:2+GREEN:3 → blocked on GREEN
     - **L2_66 (BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3)**: Have BLUE:2+RED:1+BLACK:3, need BLUE:1+RED:1 → tied but L2_69 is simpler
     - **L3 cards**: Require 3-7 gems each → far too expensive
   - **L2_69 IS OPTIMAL: Only need 2 more BLACK tokens to complete**

2. **Immediate +1 GOLD Wildcard**:
   - Board GOLD:5 available for reservation reward
   - Tokens become: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (7/10)
   - GOLD acts as universal color substitute for future purchases

3. **Dual-Prestige Pathway Secure**:
   - L2_50 (reserved): 2 prestige when BLACK:1 collected
   - L2_69 (now reserved): 2 prestige when BLACK:2 collected
   - Total locked: 4 prestige from two cards alone (4+2+2=8 prestige)
   - Remaining 7 prestige available via nobles and L2_64

4. **Board Refresh Trigger**:
   - Opponent at 10/10 MUST purchase or reserve (can't take tokens)
   - Opponent will buy L1_5 or similar Level 1 card to free tokens
   - Removes face-up card, triggers LEVEL_2 deck draw with replacement
   - New card could be prestige opportunity or tokens may rebalance
   - L2_69 in reserved hand protects prestige opportunity

**OPPONENT SITUATION (TURN 18):**
Opponent at 10/10 tokens:
- Cannot take tokens (would exceed 10-token cap)
- MUST purchase or reserve
- Analysis of prestige options:
  - Can opponent afford prestige? 
    - L2_63 (purchased already): N/A
    - L2_64 (GREEN:6): opponent has GREEN:3, need 3 more, unaffordable
    - L2_66 (BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3): opponent has all exactly matched! With RED:1 bonus → effective cost BLUE:3+RED:1+BLACK:3. Opponent CAN purchase L2_66!
  - BUT: L2_66 is on opponent's turn, not mine
  - We're about to find out if opponent buys prestige

**POST-ACTION STATE (TURN 18 COMPLETION):**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (7/10)
- Reserved cards: L2_50 (2 prestige), L2_69 (2 prestige) - TWO PRESTIGE CARDS QUEUED
- Prestige: 4/15 (unchanged this turn, but secured pathways locked)
- Token capacity: 7/10 (ready for 3-token action next turn if board refreshes)

**TURN 18-19 PROJECTION:**
- Turn 18 (NOW): Reserve L2_69, gain +1 GOLD
- Turn 18 (opponent): 
  - If opponent purchases L2_66: opponent prestige 2→3 (opponent closes gap to 4-3)
  - Board refreshes: new LEVEL_2 card replaces L2_66
  - Tokens likely rebalance
- Turn 19 (my action): 
  - Post-refresh board has different card + token distribution
  - Primary goal: Accumulate BLACK:1 → enables L2_50 completion → prestige 4→6
  - Secondary goal: Accumulate BLACK:1 more → enables L2_69 completion → prestige 6→8
  - With 7 tokens + 3 slots, can possibly take BLACK:1+ other colors
  - Victory path: 4→6→8 prestige within 3 turns from two reserved cards

**STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:**
Even if opponent cuts prestige gap to 4-3, I've locked in 2 prestige cards (L2_50 + L2_69) that require only BLACK accumulation. Opponent remains disadvantaged: at 10/10 tokens with limited options. My next 3 turns convert reserved cards into prestige as BLACK returns to board post-refresh. By turn 21, I'll have 8 prestige with unobstructed path to nobles (N2, N10) for remaining 7 prestige.

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ Reserve action on visible card
✓ Card exists: L2_69 in LEVEL_2 face-up cards
✓ Gain: +1 GOLD token (board GOLD:5 available)
✓ Card enters reserved hand for future purchase
✓ Board draws replacement LEVEL_2 card from deck
✓ Turn preserves prestige lead during token depletion crisis
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_69, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=6, RED=4, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1, and my score is 2. The card L2_64 costs 6 GREEN and gives 3 prestige points. With my GREEN bonus of 3, I only need to pay 3 GREEN tokens — and I have exactly 3 GREEN tokens available. This purchase is fully affordable and immediately yields 3 points, increasing my score to 5. After buying L2_64, my GREEN tokens will drop to 0, reducing my total tokens to 7 (well under 10), which gives me flexibility for future turns. Additionally, purchasing L2_64 gives me a fourth GREEN bonus (now GREEN=4), which brings me closer to qualifying for Noble N2 (requires GREEN=4 and RED=4; I currently have RED bonus=1, so I still need 3 more RED bonuses, but this is a step in that direction). No other card is as immediately impactful: L2_66 requires BLUE=3 (I have 2) and BLACK=3 (I have 1); L2_62 requires BLUE=5 (I have 2); L3 cards are far out of reach. Therefore, purchasing L2_64 is the optimal move to maximize my score efficiently.

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 19: BREAKTHROUGH PRESTIGE ACQUISITION USING GOLD WILDCARD

**CRITICAL STATE REASSESSMENT:**
- My prestige: 4/15 (opponent: 5/15) - PRESTIGE GAP CLOSED! Opponent acquired L2_64 (3 prestige) and now leads by 1 point
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (7/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 (triple advancement locked)
- My reserved: L2_50 (2 prestige, costs WHITE:2+RED:1+BLACK:4), L2_69 (backup)
- Opponent: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:4, RED:0, BLACK:1 (8/10) - tokens increasing
- Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:4, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:4

**BREAKTHROUGH RECOGNITION:**
I have overlooked a critical pathway: GOLD token power as wildcard substitutes!

**PAYMENT ANALYSIS FOR L2_50:**
L2_50 cost: WHITE:2 + RED:1 + BLACK:4
With WHITE:2 bonus applied: Effective cost = RED:1 + BLACK:4 (WHITE portion eliminated)

Current inventory: RED:1✓, BLACK:3 + GOLD:1✓
- RED requirement: 1 ✓ (exact match)
- BLACK requirement: 4 ✓ (3 physical BLACK tokens + 1 GOLD token acting as BLACK wildcard = 4 total)
- GOLD is valid currency for any gem substitution per rules

**PURCHASE LEGALITY VERIFICATION:**
✓ Card exists: L2_50 in my reserved hand
✓ Cost coverage: RED:1 + BLACK:3 + GOLD:1 fully covers RED:1 + BLACK:4 requirement
✓ Token sufficiency: 7/10 tokens available for spending
✓ No token returns required
✓ Payment mechanism: Gold tokens substitute unmantched gem requirements

**IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE WIN:**
Upon purchasing L2_50:
- Prestige: 4 → 6/15 (+2 prestige, reaching 40% of victory)
- New bonus: +1 BLUE (upgraded from BLUE:1 → BLUE:2 total bonus)
- Total bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1
- Tokens remaining: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:0 (2/10)
- Board refresh: L2_50 vacates, new LEVEL_2 card is drawn

**STRATEGIC IMPACT:
- Prestige lead regained: 6 vs opponent's 5 (+1 advantage)
- BLUE bonus doubled: Unlocks L2_62 and other BLUE-heavy cards (BLUE:5, GREEN:3 effective cost reduced to BLUE:4 with BLUE:2 bonus + 1 GREEN bonus)
- Token capacity freed: 2 BLUE available next turn for flexible accumulation
- L2_69 (1 reserved card): Still available with BLACK:3 held, only needs BLACK:2 more for eventual +2 prestige
- Opponent momentum disrupted: At 5 prestige, opponent cannot close gap if I maintain 6-prestige lead pending Noble acquisition

**OPPONENT THREAT (POST-TURN 19):**
Opponent cannot purchase prestige this turn:
- L2_66 (1 prestige): Needs BLUE:3✓, RED:2✗ (RED:0 on board, opponent has RED:0)
- L2_62 (2 prestige): Needs BLUE:5✗ (opponent has 2, would need 3 more with BLUE:0 on board)
- L2_45, L2_42: Both require multiple WHITE or mixed colors; opponent lacks coverage
- Opponent forced to take tokens again (likely GREEN:2, further increasing token bloat)

**POST-TURN 19-20 PROJECTION:**
- Turn 20 (opponent): Unable to purchase prestige, forced token accumulation → tokens exceed 10 → must purchase low-value card to free tokens
- Turn 21 (my action): Board partially refreshed. If BLACK returns (from deck draw), I can accumulate BLACK:2 → purchase L2_69 → prestige 6→8
- By Turn 22: 8 prestige accumulated (53% victory), unassailable 3-point lead over opponent

**CRITICAL RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD action on reserved player card
✓ Card ID exists: L2_50 in reserved deck
✓ Effective cost (with bonuses): RED:1, BLACK:4
✓ Payment capability: RED:1✓, BLACK:3 + GOLD:1 (wildcard)✓
✓ Token overage: None (spending 5 tokens, retaining 2)
✓ No illegal token returns
✓ Gold token substitution valid per game rules

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_50 using RED:1, BLACK:3, and GOLD:1 (wildcard). Prestige 4→6, regain advantage, trigger board refresh for future prestige accumulation via L2_69 completion.**
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_50]

======================================================================================

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total = 7). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=1, and my score is 5. My immediate goal is to qualify for Noble N2, which requires GREEN=4 and RED=4 in bonuses. I already have GREEN=4, so I need 3 more RED bonuses. The best way to get RED bonuses is by purchasing RED bonus cards. Looking at the face-up cards, L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus) costs BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=1 covers 1 RED, so effective RED=4, which covers the RED=2 cost), and BLACK=1 (need 3 → short 2). Not affordable yet. L1_35 (0 pts, RED bonus) costs WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=2. I have WHITE=1 (plus WHITE bonus=1 → total WHITE=2, which covers the cost), GREEN=0 (but GREEN bonus=4 covers the GREEN=1 cost), BLACK=1 (need 2 → short 1). Close, but missing 1 BLACK. L1_5 (0 pts, BLACK bonus) costs GREEN=2, RED=1 — unhelpful for RED bonuses. L1_3 (0 pts, BLACK bonus) costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1 — I have WHITE=1 (with bonus=1 → covers), BLUE=2, RED=3 → affordable, but gives BLACK, not RED. So I need to collect tokens to afford L1_35 (to get RED bonus) or L2_66. L1_35 is cheaper and gives RED bonus, so prioritizing it. To buy L1_35, I need BLACK=2 (currently have 1 → need 1 more) and WHITE=2 (have 1 token + 1 bonus → covered), GREEN=1 (covered by bonus). So only need 1 more BLACK. Board has BLACK=3 tokens (≥4? No, 3 < 4, so can't double). Must take 3 different colors. Available tokens: WHITE=3, GREEN=4, RED=1, BLACK=3 (BLUE=0). I need BLACK, so that’s one. Other useful colors: RED=1 (I have RED=3 tokens, but RED bonus is low — more RED tokens could help with future RED costs, but not critical). GREEN=4 (but I have GREEN bonus=4, so GREEN tokens are rarely needed). WHITE=3 (I have WHITE=1 token + 1 bonus; more WHITE tokens could help with WHITE costs like L2_45 (5 WHITE, 2 pts) or L3_81). Taking WHITE, BLACK, and GREEN is safe: WHITE for potential WHITE card purchases, BLACK to reach 2 for L1_35, GREEN as filler (since it’s abundant). After taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, 1 GREEN: tokens become WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (total = 9 ≤ 10, no returns needed). This sets me up to buy L1_35 next turn (cost WHITE=2 (1 token + 1 bonus), GREEN=1 (bonus covers), BLACK=2 (tokens) → fully affordable), gaining a RED bonus (RED=2 total), moving closer to N2.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=1}
Reasoning: TURN 20: CRITICAL PRESTIGE RACE - POSITIONING FOR NOBLE CLAIM

**CURRENT POSITION ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 6/15 (40% victory) vs opponent: 5/15
- Lead: +1 prestige, but FRAGILE
- My tokens: W:0, B:2, G:0, R:0, K:0 (2/10) - massive capacity available
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1
- Reserved: L2_69 (B:5, 2 prestige)

**OPPONENT THREAT (IMMINENT):**
- Opponent at 10/10 tokens (MAXED OUT) - MUST purchase or reserve next turn
- Affordable prestige option: L2_42 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLACK:2 → effective W:2, G:2, B:2 with bonuses)
- Opponent has all required colors: W:2✓, G:1✓, B:2✓ (can afford!)
- PROJECTED: Opponent buys L2_42 (+1 prestige) → 5→6 prestige (TIES ME at 6-6)
- Board refreshes after opponent's purchase

**PRESTIGE GAP REALITY CHECK:**
Once opponent ties at 6-6, the game becomes a RACE to 15. Nobles become critical (3 prestige each = fastest path):
- 3 nobles claim path: 6→9→12→15 (7 turns if uncontested)
- Card purchases (average 1.5 prestige each): Much slower accumulation

**NOBLE ANALYSIS - WHICH IS CLOSEST TO ACHIEVABLE?**

**N10 (RED:3, WHITE:3, BLACK:3):**
- Current inventory: R:0, W:0, B:0
- Deficit: R:3, W:3, B:3 (9 total)
- Board available: R:1, W:2, B:2 (only 5 total)
- After taking 3 tokens: Can reach ~3-4 of 9 required
- Multi-turn accumulation path: Takes 2-3 turns with board cooperation
- **MOST ACHIEVABLE**: Only need W:1+R:2+B:2 more after current action

**N2 (GREEN:4, RED:4):**
- Board has: G:3, R:1 (only 4 of 8 needed)
- BLOCKED: Red nearly depleted on board (only 1 left after I take 1)

**N8 (GREEN:3, BLUE:3, WHITE:3):**
- Board has: G:3, B:0, W:2 (only 5 of 9 needed)
- BLOCKED: Blue unavailable on board (0 tokens)

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1**

**Why this specific combination:**
1. **Direct N10 Path**: Each token moves me 1/3 closer to claiming 3-prestige noble
   - After: W:1/3, R:1/3, B:1/3 of requirements satisfied
   - Next 2 turns: W:1+R:2+B:2 more accumulation → CLAIM N10 for 6→9 prestige

2. **Multi-turn Efficiency**: 
   - Turn 20 (now): Take W:1, R:1, B:1 → 5/10 tokens
   - Turn 21 (post-opponent): Take W:1, R:1, B:1 → 8/10 tokens  
   - Turn 22+: Take remaining W:1, R:1, B:1 → VISIT N10 (3 prestige) → prestige 6→9 (60% victory)
   - Opponent still at 6, I reach 9 (unassailable 3-point gap)

3. **Board Resource Alignment**:
   - I take: W:1/2, R:1/1 (depletes RED fully, takes 50% of WHITE)
   - Remaining: W:1, G:3, B:2, GOLD:5
   - Next turn board may refresh if opponent purchases, bringing new tokens
   - Even if not, I can take W:1+B:1+G:1 on turn 21, then W:1+B:1+G:1 on turn 22 to reach N10

4. **Token Capacity Preserved**:
   - After taking 3: 2 + 3 = 5/10 (generous capacity)
   - Can adjust strategy if board refreshes unexpectedly post-opponent action

**VERIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVES:**
Why NOT Green?
- L2_62 (2 prestige, B:5+G:3): With bonuses, effective cost B:3+G:2. Board has B:0 → impossible this turn
- N2 path blocked by insufficient RED on board (only 1 available)
- Adding GREEN dilutes focus on N10

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ Exactly 3 tokens of different colors (WHITE, RED, BLACK)
✓ Each set to 1
✓ All available on board: WHITE:2✓, RED:1✓, BLACK:2✓
✓ Token count after: 2 + 3 = 5/10 ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No returns needed
✓ Legal action

**POST-TURN 20 STATE:**
- Tokens: W:1, B:2, G:0, R:1, K:1 (5/10)
- Prestige: 6/15 (unchanged this turn but positioned for +3 Nobel claim)
- Board tokens remaining: W:1, B:1, G:3, GOLD:5

**STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:**
This move initiates the NOBLE RACE endgame. By committing to N10 accumulation, I create an unambiguous 2-turn pathway to 9 prestige (60% victory). Even if opponent claims a prestige card (+1), I maintain prestige momentum advantage. Opponent cannot block N10 claim without also pursuing same tokens (resource contention). By turn 22, I'll have 9 prestige with only 6 remaining needed for victory—effectively insurmountable gap.

**DECISION: Take WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 to initiate N10 noble race.**
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=1, and my score is 5. I intended last turn to collect tokens to afford L1_35, a RED bonus card (0 pts) costing WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=2. Now, I have WHITE=2 tokens (plus WHITE bonus=1 → total WHITE=3, which covers the WHITE=2 cost), GREEN=1 token (plus GREEN bonus=4 → more than covers GREEN=1 cost), and BLACK=2 tokens (exactly covers BLACK=2 cost). Thus, L1_35 is fully affordable without using gold. Purchasing it gives a RED bonus, increasing my RED bonus count from 1 to 2, which progresses me toward Noble N2 (requires RED=4, GREEN=4; I already have GREEN=4). While L1_35 gives no immediate points, securing RED bonuses is critical for the 3-point N2, and this purchase reduces my token count from 10 to 7 (WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=3, BLACK=0), freeing up space for future actions. No other card is as strategically valuable: L2_66 requires more BLUE/BLACK, L2_45 (2 pts) needs 5 WHITE (I’d have 0 after this purchase anyway), and other L1 cards don’t provide RED bonuses. Buying L1_35 is the optimal move to advance toward N2.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: **TURN 21: STRATEGIC TOKEN ACCUMULATION TOWARD N10 NOBLE**

**CURRENT SITUATION:**
- My prestige: 6/15 (40%) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%) - MAINTAINING +1 advantage
- My tokens: W:1, B:2, G:0, R:1, K:1 (5/10) - excellent capacity for accumulation
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1
- Reserved: L2_69 (2 prestige, needs K:5 - I have K:1, board offers K:3, total would be K:4, SHORT K:1)

**BOARD CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
Available tokens: WHITE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:5, RED:0, BLUE:0
- RED is completely depleted from board
- BLUE is completely depleted from board

**NOBLE ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS:**

**N10 (R:3, W:3, K:3):**
- I have: R:1, W:1, K:1
- Still need: R:2, W:2, K:2
- Board can provide: W:2✓, K:3✓, but RED:0✗
- **STATUS: Partially achievable. RED is current bottleneck but likely to return to board after card purchases/board refreshes. This is the closest noble path.**

**N2 (G:4, R:4):**
- I have: G:0, R:1
- RED bottleneck blocks this path immediately

**N8 (G:3, B:3, W:3):**
- I have: G:0, B:2, W:1
- Need: G:3, B:1, W:2
- BLUE:0 on board = impossible this turn

**CARD PURCHASE OPTIONS:**
No prestige cards are currently affordable:
- L2_62 (2 prestige): Effective cost B:3, G:2 (with bonuses). I have B:2, G:0. SHORT G:2.
- L2_45 (2 prestige, W:5): Effective cost W:3 (with WHITE:2 bonus). Board didn't provide W:2 in same turn legally. Need multi-turn accumulation.
- L2_69 (reserved): Need K:4 more, only K:3 available on board = SHORT K:1

**CONCLUSION: NO IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE PURCHASES ARE VIABLE THIS TURN**

Best action is strategic token accumulation toward N10 noble claim, which represents fastest path to +3 prestige (currently 20% point swing toward victory).

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: WHITE:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1**

**Why this specific combination:**
1. **Direct N10 Contribution**: Each token advances me toward the noble requirement
   - After action: W:2 (2/3 for N10), K:2 (2/3 for N10), R:1 (1/3 for N10)
   - **Multi-turn projection**: Turn 22 take W:1 more → W:3✓; Turn 23 take K:1 more → K:3✓. Then once RED returns to board (via card purchase/board refresh), claim N10 for +3 prestige (6→9, 60% victory)

2. **Diversification Hedge**: Taking GREEN:1 provides optionality
   - If N10 path stalls longer than expected, I have G:1 that could contribute to N2 (currently G:0, would need 4 total)
   - Only costs me 1 token slot vs. pure single-color focus

3. **Token Capacity Optimization**:
   - Currently 5/10 tokens
   - Adding 3 tokens = 8/10 (excellent capacity for future flexibility)
   - Avoids wasting turn on GOLD:2 (wildcards, less directed toward concrete goal)

4. **Board Alignment**:
   - Depletes WHITE:2→1, BLACK:3→2, GREEN:3→2 on board
   - If opponent takes tokens next turn, likely depletes RED/BLUE further or takes GOLD
   - Subsequent board draws/refreshes will eventually restore RED to bank

**VERIFICATION:**
✓ Exactly 3 tokens of 3 different colors (WHITE, BLACK, GREEN)
✓ Each set to 1
✓ All available: WHITE:2✓, BLACK:3✓, GREEN:3✓
✓ Token total after: 5 + 3 = 8/10 ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No returns required
✓ Legal action under standard TAKE_TOKENS rules

**POST-TURN 21 STATE:**
- Tokens: W:2, B:2, G:1, R:1, K:2 (8/10)
- Prestige: 6/15 (unchanged, but positioned for +3 noble claim in 2-3 turns)
- N10 progress: 67% complete (W:2/3, K:2/3, R:1/3)
- Opponent at 5/15: Cannot catch 9/15 even if they claim same noble next

**STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:**
This move commits to the highest-prestige-per-turn conversion (nobles give 3 prestige in 1 action vs. cards averaging 1.5-2 prestige). Once RED returns to available tokens (via board refresh post-purchase/draw), I'll complete W:3 and K:3 requirements, then claim N10 for immediate 6→9 prestige swing. This establishes an unbeatable lead heading into late-game.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=5}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=0 (total = 7). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, and my score is 5. My strategic goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 and RED=4 in bonuses. I already have GREEN=4, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. The best path is to buy RED bonus cards. L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus) costs BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 covers 2 RED → effective RED=5, which covers RED=2 cost), and BLACK=0 (need 3 → short 3). To afford L2_66, I need 1 more BLUE and 3 BLACK. But BLUE=0 on the board, so BLUE is unavailable. Next best: L1 RED bonus cards. L1_10 (0 pts, BLUE bonus) is irrelevant. No other face-up L1 cards give RED bonuses. So I must collect tokens for L2_66 despite BLUE shortage. Alternatively, consider L2_42 (1 pt, BLACK bonus) costs WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2 — unhelpful. L2_45 (2 pts, BLACK bonus) costs WHITE=5 — I have WHITE=1, board has WHITE=1, so impossible soon. Focus on BLACK: I need BLACK for L2_66. Board has BLACK=2 tokens (but doubling requires ≥4, so can't take 2 BLACK). Must take 3 different colors. Available tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, BLACK=2 (BLUE=0, RED=0). I need BLACK, so include it. GREEN=2 is abundant; I have GREEN bonus=4, so GREEN tokens are rarely needed, but it’s a filler. WHITE=1: I have WHITE=1 token + 1 bonus; more WHITE could help with future WHITE costs (e.g., L2_45, L3_81), but low priority. Taking WHITE, GREEN, BLACK: 1 each. Current tokens: WHITE=1+1=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1+1=2, RED=3, BLACK=0+1=1 (total = 2+2+2+3+1=10 ≤10, no returns needed). This gives me BLACK=1, progressing toward L2_66’s BLACK=3 requirement. Next turn, I can take more BLACK (if available) or reassess. This is the most efficient use of my turn to collect critical BLACK tokens.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 22: FORCED STRATEGIC RESERVATION DUE TO BOARD TOKEN DEPLETION

**CRITICAL BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 6/15 (40% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- Maintaining +1 prestige lead, but FRAGILE
- My tokens: W:2, B:2, G:1, R:1, K:2, GOLD:0 (8/10) - at capacity
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1
- Reserved: L2_69 (2 prestige, costs BLACK:5)
- Opponent: W:2, B:2, G:2, R:3, K:1 (10/10 TOKENS MAXED OUT - must purchase/reserve)

**CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINT - TAKE_TOKENS IMPOSSIBLE:**
Board available: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

Standard token acquisition analysis:
- Option A (3 different colors): Requires 3 distinct colors, board only has 2 non-GOLD colors (GREEN:1, BLACK:1) → IMPOSSIBLE ✗
- Option B (2 same color, 4+ required): GREEN:1 < 4, BLACK:1 < 4, all others 0 → IMPOSSIBLE ✗
- CONCLUSION: Cannot take tokens this turn due to board depletion

**CARD PURCHASE AFFORDABILITY CHECK:**
All prestige cards require resources I don't have in full:
- L2_66 (1 prestige, B:3+R:2+K:3): Have B:2✓, R:1(need 2), K:2(need 3) → SHORT
- L2_62 (2 prestige, B:5+G:3): Effective B:3+G:2 with bonuses. Have B:2(need 3), G:1(need 2) → SHORT  
- L2_45 (2 prestige, W:5): Effective cost W:3 with WHITE:2 bonus. Have W:2, NEED W:1 MORE
- L2_42 (1 prestige): SHORT on GREEN:1
- L3 cards: All require 3-7 gems, completely out of reach
- L2_69 (reserved): Have K:2, need K:5, board offers K:1 max → SHORT K:2

**BREAKTHROUGH RECOGNITION - L2_45 AFFORDABILITY PATH:**
L2_45 costs WHITE:5 → Effective cost WHITE:3 (with WHITE:2 bonus)
My current inventory: WHITE:2 (SHORT WHITE:1)

GOLD TOKENS ACT AS WILDCARDS:
- If I acquire GOLD:1, I can substitute it for the missing WHITE:1
- Payment becomes: WHITE:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (wildcard as WHITE) = sufficient for L2_45
- L2_45 purchase grants: +2 prestige (4.2% victory swing) + BLACK bonus (+1 to BLACK:2 total)

**STRATEGIC PATH TO L2_45:**
1. **Turn 22 (NOW): Reserve visible card → Receive +1 GOLD token**
2. **Turn 23 (Next): Purchase L2_45 using WHITE:2 + GOLD:1 → Prestige 6→8 (53% victory)**

This creates:
- Prestige jump from 6→8 (2-point gain)
- Extends lead over opponent to 3 points (opponent at 5, I at 8)
- More critically: opponent cannot catch up even if they also claim prestige card
- BLACK bonus improves future card purchase efficiency
- Maintains token capacity (prestige purchase burns 3 tokens, frees capacity)

**CARD SELECTION FOR RESERVATION: L2_62 (2 prestige)**

Why L2_62 over alternatives:
1. **2 prestige value**: Balanced reward if future conditions enable purchase
2. **Complements future strategy**: BLUE:5+GREEN:3 cost aligns with potential token accumulation
3. **Protects prestige pathway**: If L2_45 purchase falls through for any reason, L2_62 remains as backup
4. **Non-duplicative bonuses**: Provides GREEN bonus (distinct from already having WHITE:2, BLUE:2)

**POST-TURN 22 STATE:**
- Action: Reserve L2_62
- Tokens: W:2, B:2, G:1, R:1, K:2, GOLD:1 (9/10)
- Reserved cards: L2_69 (2 prestige), L2_62 (2 prestige) = 4 prestige "locked"
- Prestige: 6/15 (unchanged this turn, but set up for +2 via L2_45 next turn)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1 (unchanged)

**TURN 22-23 PROJECTION:**
- Turn 22 (NOW): Reserve L2_62 → gain GOLD:1
- Turn 22 (opponent): At 10/10 maxed tokens, must purchase/reserve. Likely buys L1_3, L1_5, etc. to free tokens. Prestige likely unchanged (5/15)
- Turn 23 (my action): Purchase L2_45 with W:2+GOLD:1 → Prestige 6→8 (3-point lead established)
- By Turn 23: I have 8 prestige (53% victory path). Opponent at ≤5. Unassailable 3-point gap.

**STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:**
This move converts a turn that would be wasted (board tokens unavailable) into a forward-momentum setup. The guaranteed +2 prestige next turn via L2_45 purchase creates an insurmountable lead. Even if opponent buys prestige, they remain 2-3 points behind. N10 noble becomes backup path (already have 67% progress: W:2/3, K:2/3, R:1/3). Victory timeline accelerates: 6→8→9+(noble) prestige by turn 24.

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ RESERVE_CARD action on visible face-up card
✓ Card exists: L2_62 in LEVEL_2 face-up cards list
✓ Gain: +1 GOLD token (board GOLD:5 available, sufficient)
✓ Card enters reserved hand
✓ Board draws replacement LEVEL_2 card from deck
✓ All token counts remain valid (8+GOLD=9/10 ≤ 10 max)
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_62, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=6, RED=5, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, and my score is 5. My strategic goal is still to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 and RED=4 in bonuses. I already have GREEN=4, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. The best RED bonus card available is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), which costs BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=5, which covers RED=2), and BLACK=1 (need 3 → short 2). So I need 1 more BLUE and 2 more BLACK to afford L2_66. However, the board token bank shows WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=1. BLUE is completely unavailable (0 on board), so I cannot collect BLUE right now. BLACK has only 1 token available — insufficient to double (requires ≥4), so I can only take it as part of a 3-color mix. But there are only two colors available on the board: GREEN=1 and BLACK=1. I need three different colors to take tokens, but only two are available. Therefore, taking 3 different tokens is impossible. Can I take 2 of the same color? BLACK has only 1 (needs ≥4 to take 2), GREEN has 1 (also <4). So taking tokens in any valid way is impossible. Next, can I purchase any card? Let's check affordable options. L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1. I have WHITE=2 (plus bonus=1 → total=3), BLUE=2, RED=3 → affordable. But it gives BLACK bonus, not RED — unhelpful for N2. L1_5 costs GREEN=2, RED=1. I have GREEN=2 (plus bonus=4 → plenty), RED=3 → affordable. But it gives BLACK bonus again. L1_10 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. I have all those tokens → affordable, but gives BLUE bonus, not RED. L1_29 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=1 → affordable, but gives GREEN (already maxed for N2). None of these help with RED bonuses. What about L2 cards? L2_66 is not affordable (short BLUE/BLACK). L2_45 needs WHITE=5 — I have 2. L2_42 needs WHITE=3 (I have 2 + bonus=1 → 3), GREEN=3 (I have 2 + bonus=4 → 6), BLACK=2 (I have 1) → short 1 BLACK. Close, but not affordable, and gives BLACK, not RED. L2_46 needs BLACK=6 — impossible. So no useful purchases. Can I reserve a card? I could reserve a RED bonus card to secure it, but the only visible RED bonus card is L2_66, which I can’t buy yet. Reserving it would cost me a turn and give me a gold token (board has GOLD=4). But is that better than doing nothing? However, the rules state that if no valid token move is possible and no purchase is useful, reserving might be an option. But wait — can I take tokens? Board has GREEN=1 and BLACK=1. That’s only two colors. The rules require either 3 different colors (impossible here) or 2 of the same color (requires ≥4 of that color on board — neither GREEN nor BLACK meets that). So taking tokens is invalid. Therefore, the only legal moves are purchase or reserve. Since no purchase advances my RED bonus goal, and reserving L2_66 would let me take it later (and give me a gold token which could substitute for missing BLUE/BLACK), that might be a good option. But wait — I have 10 tokens. If I reserve, I get a gold token, making my total 11, which is over the limit. The rules say you receive a gold token if available when reserving, but you cannot exceed 10 tokens total. However, the standard Splendor rules allow the gold token to be received even if at 10, making it 11, because gold is a special

Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, and my score is 5. My goal is still to reach RED=4 bonuses for Noble N2 (3 pts). Currently, the only viable RED bonus card is L2_66 (costs BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3, gives 1 pt + RED bonus). I have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 covers RED cost easily), BLACK=1 (need 3 → short 2). Blue tokens are completely unavailable on the board (BLUE=0), so I cannot collect BLUE this turn. However, I can collect BLACK, which is critically needed. The board shows BLACK=1 token available. Since BLACK < 4, I cannot take 2 BLACK. I must take 3 different colors. Available token colors on the board: GREEN=1, BLACK=1 (WHITE=0, BLUE=0, RED=0). So the only possible 3-color combination is impossible—only 2 colors (GREEN and BLACK) are available! Therefore, I cannot legally take 3 different colors. Can I take 2 of the same color? To take 2 of a color, that color must have ≥4 tokens on the board. But GREEN=1 and BLACK=1 — both <4. So I cannot take 2 of any color either. This means I cannot perform a TAKE_TOKENS action at all. What other actions are possible? PURCHASE_CARD: Review affordable cards. I have WHITE=2 (bonus=1 → total=3), BLUE=2 (bonus=2 → total=4), GREEN=2 (bonus=4 → total=6), RED=3 (bonus=2 → total=5), BLACK=1 (bonus=0 → total=1). Check face-up cards: L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1 → I can pay this (WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1). It gives BLACK bonus (not RED), but buying it would reduce my token count (from 10 to 7) and give a BLACK bonus, which might help with L2_66’s BLACK cost. However, it doesn’t progress me toward RED=4. L1_5 costs GREEN=2, RED=1 → affordable (GREEN=2, RED=1), gives BLACK bonus — same issue. L1_10 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 → I have all tokens, but gives BLUE bonus (I already have BLUE=2 bonuses; opponent has reserved L2_62 which needs BLUE=5, so giving them more BLUE competition is bad). L1_29 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=1 → affordable, gives GREEN bonus (I already have GREEN=4 — useless). L2 cards: L2_66 too expensive (need BLACK=3, only have 1). L2_45 needs WHITE=5 — impossible. L2_42 needs WHITE=3 (have 2+1=3), GREEN=3 (have 2+4=6), BLACK=2 (have 1 → short 1). L2_46 needs BLACK=6 — no. L3 cards: all too expensive. RESERVE_CARD: I could reserve L2_66 to prevent opponent from taking it, and get a gold token. The opponent has 6 points (1 ahead of me), so blocking their options is wise. L2_66 is the only RED bonus card left; reserving it secures it for me and denies opponent. I have room to reserve (not at 3 reserved). Reserving gives me a gold token (board has GOLD=4), which can substitute for missing BLACK or BLUE later. This is better than buying a non-RED card. So: RESERVE_CARD L2_66.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. My score is 5. My strategic goal is to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires RED=4 and GREEN=4 bonuses. I already have GREEN=4, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. The best card to get a RED bonus is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (with RED bonus=2, I can cover RED cost easily), and BLACK=1 (need 3 → short 2). BLUE is unavailable on the board (0 tokens), so I cannot collect BLUE now. However, BLACK=1 on the board, and I have BLACK=1 token. Since board BLACK=1 < 4, I cannot take 2 BLACK. I must take 3 different colors. Available token colors on board: GREEN=1, BLACK=1 (WHITE=0, BLUE=0, RED=0). So only two colors are available: GREEN and BLACK. But the rules require taking exactly 3 different colors when taking single tokens — and only two colors are present on the board. Therefore, I cannot take 3 different colors. Also, no color has ≥4 tokens, so I cannot take 2 of the same color. Thus, **I cannot legally take tokens**. Next, consider reserving a card. I can reserve a visible card or draw blind. No visible RED bonus cards are affordable soon except L2_66, which I’m already targeting. Reserving L2_66 is unnecessary since it’s already face-up. Alternatively, I could reserve a LEVEL_3 card for future engine building, but that’s low priority. Now consider purchasing a card. Can I buy any card? Check affordable options: L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1. I have WHITE=2 (plus bonus=1 → total 3), BLUE=2, RED=3 → fully affordable. But L1_3 gives BLACK bonus, which doesn’t help with RED=4. L1_5 costs GREEN=2, RED=1 → I have GREEN=2 (bonus=4 covers more than enough), RED=3 → affordable, but gives BLACK bonus — again, not RED. L1_10 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 → I have all those tokens, but it gives BLUE bonus — irrelevant. L1_29 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=1 → affordable, gives GREEN bonus (already have 4, max useful). None of these help with RED bonuses. L2 cards: L2_45 needs WHITE=5 — I have 2. L2_42 needs WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2 — I have WHITE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=1 — short. L2_46 needs BLACK=6 — impossible. L2_66 needs BLACK=3 — I have 1. So no L2 card is affordable. Therefore, **I cannot purchase any useful card, and I cannot legally take tokens** because only two token colors (GREEN and BLACK) are available on the board, but the rules require three different colors for a 1-1-1 take, and no color has ≥4 for a double-take. The only legal action left is to reserve a card. I should reserve a LEVEL_2 or LEVEL_3 card that could help later. Looking at opponent’s reserved cards: they have L2_69 (BLACK=5, RED bonus, 2 pts) and L2_62 (BLUE=5, GREEN bonus). I don’t need GREEN. I could reserve L2_69 myself, but it gives RED bonus — useful! But L2_69 is not face-up; it’s only in opponent’s reserved hand, so I cannot reserve it. Face-up cards don’t include other RED bonus cards. So best reserve option is to draw blind from LEVEL_2 to potentially get a RED bonus card. That gives me a gold token (since GOLD=4 ≥1), which can help with future purchases. So I will reserve from LEVEL_2 deck.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 23: EXECUTING BREAKTHROUGH PRESTIGE ACQUISITION VIA L2_45 PURCHASE

**CRITICAL CURRENT STATE:**
- My prestige: 6/15 (40% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- My tokens: W:2, B:2, G:1, R:1, K:2, GOLD:1 (9/10) - GOLD obtained from Turn 22 reservation ✓
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1
- Reserved: L2_69 (2 prestige), L2_62 (2 prestige) = 4 prestige locked
- Opponent: W:2, B:2, G:2, R:3, K:1 (10/10 MAXED - FORCED ACTION)

**TURN 22 COMPLETION VERIFICATION:**
As projected, Turn 22 reservation of L2_62 succeeded:
- Action taken: Reserved L2_62
- Result: +1 GOLD token acquired from board (GOLD:5 available)
- Board refresh: New LEVEL_2 card drawn (L2_46 replaced L2_62 in face-up)
- My tokens updated: GOLD:1 now available for wildcard substitution

**L2_45 AFFORDABILITY BREAKTHROUGH:**
L2_45 (2 prestige, BLACK bonus):
- Base cost: WHITE:5
- My WHITE:2 bonus reduces requirement to: WHITE:3 remaining
- My inventory: WHITE:2 + GOLD:1 (wildcard)
- Payment capability: WHITE:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (acting as WHITE wildcard) = WHITE:3 ✓
- RULE COMPLIANCE: Gold tokens substitute any color per rules

**IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE VICTORY:**
Purchasing L2_45 yields:
- Prestige: 6 → 8/15 (gaining +2, reaching 53% victory threshold)
- Lead establishment: 8 vs opponent's 5 = **+3 INSURMOUNTABLE ADVANTAGE**
- New bonus: +1 BLACK (bonus from L2_45), upgrading BLACK:2→BLACK:3 total
- Token capacity: After spending W:2+GOLD:1, remaining tokens = B:2, G:1, R:1, K:2 (5/10, massive reserve)

**STRATEGIC IMPACT - WHY THIS WINS THE GAME:**

1. **Prestige Margin Analysis**:
   - Opponent's maximum catch-up: Even if opponent purchases 2 more prestige cards (+2), they'd reach 7 prestige maximum
   - My position: 8 prestige already established before opponent's next action
   - Opponent CANNOT mathematically tie me even with immediate prestige acquisition

2. **Victory Timeline Acceleration**:
   - Currently: 8/15 prestige (7 points remaining to victory)
   - Noble path: N10 is 67% complete (W:2/3, K:2/3, R:1/3). RED is currently unavailable on board (R:0 tokens), but will return via future board refresh.
   - Backup paths: L2_69 (reserved, needs K:5, have K:2) and L2_62 (reserved, needs B:5+G:3 effective, buildable)
   - Conservative estimate: 2-3 more turns to reach 15 prestige

3. **Opponent's Forced Response (Opponent's Turn 23):**
   - Opponent at 10/10 tokens, cannot take tokens
   - Must purchase or reserve to free tokens
   - Prestige cards unaffordable (L2_42 SHORT K:1, L2_66 SHORT B:1+K:2)
   - Will likely buy low-value L1 card or reserve
   - Prestige: Likely unchanged at 5
   - Board refresh: NEW tokens may appear, but gap is already insurmountable

4. **Token Flexibility Post-Purchase:**
   - After spending W:2+GOLD:1: 5 tokens remaining (B:2, G:1, R:1, K:2)
   - 5 more slots available for accumulation (10-token cap not reached)
   - Can immediately take 3 tokens next turn if board provides variety
   - WHITE bonus (now deployed) provides future card discounts

**BLACK BONUS UPGRADE SIGNIFICANCE:**
New BLACK:3 bonus (from L2_45 card) enables:
- L2_46 (3 prestige, K:6): Effective cost K:3 with BLACK:3 bonus. Have K:2, SHORT K:1. Achievable in 1-2 turns.
- Future reserved card L2_69 (K:5 cost): Effective cost K:2 with BLACK:3 bonus. Have K:2, IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE after next token action!

**REVISED VICTORY PATH (TURNS 24-26):**
- Turn 24 (opponent): Forced to buy low-value card. Board refreshes.
- Turn 25 (my action): 
  - If K tokens return to board: Take K:1 → total K:3
  - Purchase L2_69 (reserved, now affordable: K:2 effective) → Prestige 8→10 (67% victory)
- Turn 26 (my action): 
  - Access N10 noble IF RED returns to market (otherwise continue card purchases)
  - L2_62 (reserved) also accessible if needed
  - Prestige path: 10→13 (via noble) or 10→12+ (via cards)
- By Turn 27: Prestige 15 achieved, VICTORY CONFIRMED

**CRITICAL RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on face-up card
✓ Card exists: L2_45 in LEVEL_2 face-up cards
✓ Cost calculation: Base WHITE:5 - WHITE:2 bonus = WHITE:3 effective
✓ Payment method: WHITE:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (wildcard as WHITE) = WHITE:3 ✓
✓ Token sufficiency: 9 tokens available, spending 3 = 6 remaining ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No illegal token returns
✓ Card enters purchased collection, triggers board refresh

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_45 using WHITE:2 + GOLD:1 payment. Prestige 6→8, establish +3 insurmountable lead, accelerate victory timeline to turn 26-27.**

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=6, RED=5, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. My score is 5. My goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (already met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I currently have RED=2, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. The best source is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=5, covers cost), BLACK=1 (need 3 → short 2). BLUE is unavailable on the board (0 tokens), so I cannot collect BLUE now. However, I can still collect BLACK to progress toward L2_66’s BLACK=3 requirement. Board token counts: WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 (BLUE=0, RED=0). I cannot double BLACK (only 1 available), so I must take 3 different colors. I need BLACK, so that’s one. GREEN=1 is available; I have GREEN bonus=4, so GREEN tokens are rarely needed, but it’s a filler. WHITE=2 is available; I have WHITE=2 tokens + 1 bonus, but extra WHITE could help with potential future WHITE cards (e.g., L2_45, L3_81), though low priority. Taking WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (1 each) is the only valid 3-color combination available. However, I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return 3 tokens to stay at 10. Which to return? BLUE=2 (I’m short BLUE for L2_66, but board has 0 BLUE, so holding BLUE is useless until BLUE appears; however, returning BLUE would hurt when BLUE becomes available). RED=3 (I have RED bonus=2 and RED=3 tokens; RED tokens are useful for RED costs, but I don’t have immediate RED cost cards). WHITE=2 (I have WHITE bonus=1; WHITE tokens are less critical since bonuses cover costs, and board WHITE=2 means I can reacquire if needed). Best to return WHITE, as I’m not actively pursuing WHITE-heavy cards soon. Returning 2 WHITE and 1 BLUE: WHITE=2-2=0, BLUE=2-1=1. Then take 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK: WHITE=0+1=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2+1=3, RED=3, BLACK=1+1=2. Total tokens: 1+1+3+3+2=10. This gives BLACK=2 (progress toward L2_66’s 3), and GREEN=3 (useless but harmless). Alternatively, return 3 WHITE: but I only have WHITE=2, so can’t return 3 WHITE. Return options must match current holdings: WHITE=2, so max return WHITE=2. To return 3, I need to return 2 WHITE + 1 other. BLUE=2 is the next least critical (since no BLUE on board). So return WHITE=2, BLUE=1. After returning: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (total=7). Then take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2 (total=10). Now BLACK=2, closer to L2_66’s 3. This is the best path forward given token constraints.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=2, BLUE=1}]

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: TURN 24: STRATEGIC PRESTIGE ACCELERATION THROUGH BONUS UPGRADE

**CRITICAL STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 8/15 (53% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- My lead: +3 prestige (COMMANDING POSITION)
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (6/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_69 (2 prestige, BLACK:5 cost), L2_62 (2 prestige, BLUE:5+GREEN:3 cost)
- Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:5 (severely depleted)

**BOARD CONSTRAINT RECOGNITION:**
Current board has only WHITE:3 and BLUE:1 available as regular tokens. I cannot take 3 different colors (only 2 non-GOLD colors available). Standard token-taking is IMPOSSIBLE this turn.

**AVAILABLE ACTIONS – STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**

1. **RESERVE_CARD**: Would get +1 GOLD (7/10 tokens total), maintain flexibility
   - Limited prestige gain (0 immediate)
   - Sets up future wildcard usage

2. **PURCHASE_CARD – L1_5** (GREEN:2, RED:1 cost):
   - My bonuses: GREEN:1, so effective cost = GREEN:1 + RED:1
   - I have: GREEN:1✓, RED:1✓ → AFFORDABLE
   - Cost: 2 tokens (GREEN:1, RED:1 spent)
   - Result: L1_5 gives BLACK bonus → BLACK:1→BLACK:2 total
   - Post-purchase tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2 (4/10, excellent capacity)
   - Prestige: Unchanged (8/15) but positioned for massive next turn

**BREAKTHROUGH RECOGNITION – L2_69 PATHWAY:**
After purchasing L1_5 and upgrading BLACK:1→BLACK:2:
- L2_69 (reserved) costs BLACK:5
- With NEW BLACK:2 bonus, effective cost: BLACK:5-2 = BLACK:3 (not 4)
- After L1_5 purchase, I have BLACK:2 tokens remaining
- **Next turn (opponent's move will refresh board):** If BLACK tokens reappear on board (likely from deck refresh), I can:
  1. Take BLACK:3 from board → Total tokens: BLACK:5
  2. Purchase L2_69 using BLACK:3 effective cost → Prestige 8→10 (67% victory)

**STRATEGIC IMPACT:**
- Turn 24 (now): Purchase L1_5 (0 prestige, but unlock L2_69)
- Turn 24 (opponent): Forced to act. Likely board refreshes with new tokens
- Turn 25 (my turn): If BLACK tokens available, immediately purchase L2_69 → Prestige 8→10
  - Even if opponent purchases a 1-prestige card (5→6), I'm still winning 10 vs 6 (+4 gap)
  - By Turn 25, I reach 67% victory (only need 5 more prestige)

**WHY PURCHASE > RESERVE:**
- Purchasing now frees token space (6→4/10 after L1_5)
- Upgrades BLACK bonus, making L2_69 immediately affordable next turn
- Sets up guaranteed prestige jump within 2 turns
- Maintains momentum vs. opponent (already at 5/15 prestige, growing threat)
- Reserve strategy delays prestige accumulation by 1 turn (wastes tempo)

**VERIFICATION:**
✓ Card exists: L1_5 in LEVEL_1 face-up cards
✓ Card is affordable: GREEN:1 + RED:1 effective cost with my bonuses
✓ Payment tokens available: GREEN:1✓, RED:1✓
✓ Token overage: None (spending 2 of 6 = 4 remaining ≤ 10 max)
✓ Card action: Purchase_CARD on visible board card
✓ Result: BLACK bonus +1, positions prestige jump next turn

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L1_5. Upgrade BLACK bonus to unlock L2_69 prestige acquisition on turn 25. Prestige acceleration secured.**
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_5]

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=7, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, and my score is 5. My goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I need 2 more RED bonuses. The primary target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=1 (need 3 → short 2), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=5, covers cost), BLACK=2 (need 3 → short 1). Board token availability: WHITE=3, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=0. BLACK=0 on the board, so I cannot collect BLACK now. BLUE=1 is available, which is critical for L2_66. I must take 3 different colors (doubling not possible for any color, as all non-GOLD counts are ≤3). To progress toward L2_66, I need BLUE. Other useful colors: RED=1 (I have RED=3 tokens; more RED helps with RED costs, though not urgent), WHITE=3 (low priority, but filler). GREEN=1 is abundant, but I have GREEN bonus=4, so GREEN tokens are rarely needed. The only viable 3-color combination including BLUE is BLUE, RED, WHITE (since BLACK=0). Taking BLUE=1 (to reach BLUE=2), RED=1 (RED=4), WHITE=1 (WHITE=2). But I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return 3 tokens. Current tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2. Least critical tokens: GREEN=3 (bonus=4 makes GREEN tokens almost useless; I haven’t needed GREEN tokens since buying L2_64/L2_63). Returning GREEN=3 is optimal: GREEN tokens are excess, and board has GREEN=1, so I can reacquire if needed. After returning GREEN=3: tokens become WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=0, RED=3, BLACK=2 (total=7). Then take BLUE=1, RED=1, WHITE=1: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=4, BLACK=2 (total=10). Now BLUE=2 (closer to L2_66’s 3), RED=4 (helps with RED costs), WHITE=2 (filler). This sets me up to collect 1 more BLUE next turn (if available) to afford L2_66.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={GREEN=3}]

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: TURN 25: RESERVE FOR GOLD TOKEN TO ENABLE L2_69 PRESTIGE ACQUISITION

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 8/15 (53% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- Lead: +3 prestige (COMMANDING POSITION)
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2 (4/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved: L2_69 (BLACK:5 cost→effective BLACK:3, 2 prestige), L2_62

**CRITICAL BOARD STATE:**
Available tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:4, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:5

**TAKE_TOKENS ANALYSIS:**
My only options:
- Option A: Take GREEN:2 (4 available ≥ 4) → New tokens: B:2+G:2. Still can't afford prestige cards (L2_69 needs BLACK:3, L2_62 needs BLUE:3+GREEN:2, etc.)
- Option B: Take 3 different colors → IMPOSSIBLE. Only 2 board colors available (WHITE:2, GREEN:4), can't form 3 different

**CANNOT TAKE_TOKENS PRODUCTIVELY THIS TURN**

**RESERVE_CARD BREAKTHROUGH:**
Reserving a card gives +1 GOLD token. GOLD tokens substitute any color as wildcards.

**L2_69 AFFORDABILITY WITH RESERVE:**
- Card: L2_69 (BLACK:5 cost, 2 prestige, RED bonus)
- My BLACK:2 bonus reduces effective cost to BLACK:3
- After reserving for GOLD:1: Tokens become WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (5/10)
- Payment on turn 26: BLACK:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (wildcard as BLACK) = BLACK:3 ✓
- AFFORDABLE!

**STRATEGIC IMPACT:**
- Turn 25 (now): Reserve L2_46 → gain GOLD:1 → tokens 4→5
- Turn 26 (opponent): Opponent at 10/10 tokens maxed, likely purchases L2_42 → reaches 6 prestige; board refreshes
- Turn 26 (my turn): Purchase L2_69 using BLACK:2+GOLD:1 → Prestige 8→10 (67% victory)
- Lead established: 10 vs opponent's 6 = +4 prestige (INSURMOUNTABLE)
- Remaining tokens after purchase: BLUE:2 (5/10 capacity for turn 27 accumulation)

**CHOICE OF CARD TO RESERVE:**
Reserving L2_46 (BLACK:6, 3 prestige) serves as:
1. Lottery ticket for late-game if I accumulate BLACK tokens
2. Blocks opponent from accessing 3-prestige card (minor defensive benefit)
3. Doesn't interfere with my immediate strategy (L2_69 purchase next turn)

**VERIFICATION:**
✓ RESERVE_CARD on face-up card
✓ Card exists: L2_46 in LEVEL_2 face-up cards
✓ +1 GOLD token available (GOLD:5 on board)
✓ Board draws replacement L2 card from deck
✓ Tokens after: W:0+B:2+G:0+R:0+K:2+GOLD:1 = 5/10 ≤ 10 max
✓ This action directly enables L2_69 purchase next turn

**TURN 25-26 PROJECTION:**
- Turn 25 (now): Reserve L2_46 → GOLD:1 acquired
- Turn 25 (opponent): Purchase L2_42 (WHITE:2+GREEN:0+BLACK:2 effective) → prestige 5→6
- Turn 26 (my action): Purchase L2_69 using BLACK:2+GOLD:1 payment → prestige 10 (67% victory)
- Board state: Unclear but with me at 10 vs opponent at 6, gap is mathematically unbeatable

**FINAL DECISION: Reserve L2_46 to acquire GOLD:1, enabling L2_69 purchase next turn for +2 prestige and prestige lead advancement to 10/15.**

======================================================================================

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=6, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=4, BLACK=2 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, and my score is 5. My goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (already met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I need 2 more RED bonuses. The primary target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=4 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=6, covers cost), BLACK=2 (need 3 → short 1). Board token availability: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=4, RED=0, BLACK=0. BLUE=0 on the board, so I cannot collect BLUE now. BLACK=0 and RED=0 also unavailable. The only available colors are WHITE=2 and GREEN=4. I cannot double WHITE (only 2 available, <4) or GREEN (4 available, but doubling requires ≥4, so GREEN=4 allows taking 2 GREEN). However, I need to assess if doubling GREEN is useful. I have GREEN bonus=4, so GREEN tokens are almost never needed (my purchased cards L2_63/L2_64 used GREEN tokens, but no current GREEN-cost cards require tokens). L2_44 costs GREEN=5, but I have GREEN=0 tokens and bonus=4 → would need 1 GREEN token, but it gives BLACK bonus, not RED. My focus is RED bonuses, so GREEN tokens are low priority. However, I must take an action. Since only WHITE and GREEN are available, and I can’t take 3 different colors (only 2 colors exist), the only valid option is to double a color with ≥4 tokens. GREEN=4 on board, so I can take 2 GREEN. Current tokens: GREEN=0 + 2 = 2. Total tokens: 2(WHITE)+2(BLUE)+2(GREEN)+4(RED)+2(BLACK)=10, which is allowed (no return needed, since 10 ≤10). While GREEN tokens aren’t immediately useful, this is the only legal token action. Alternatively, could I purchase a card? Check affordable cards: L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1 → I have WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=4 → affordable. It gives BLACK bonus (now RED=2, BLACK=1). But I need RED bonuses, not BLACK. L1_10 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 → I have WHITE=2, GREEN=0 (but GREEN bonus=4 covers GREEN=1), RED=4, BLACK=2 → affordable. It gives BLUE bonus (BLUE=1), not RED. L1_29 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=1 → affordable (WHITE=2, BLUE=2), gives GREEN bonus (already have GREEN=4, redundant). L1_23 costs BLUE=3 → I have BLUE=2, short 1. L2_42 costs WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2 → WHITE=2 (short 1), GREEN=0 (bonus=4 covers), BLACK=2 → short WHITE. L2_44 costs GREEN=5, RED=3 → GREEN=0 (bonus=4, need 1 more GREEN token), RED=4 → short GREEN token. L2_60 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=3, BLACK=2 → WHITE=2, BLUE=2 (short 1), BLACK=2 → short BLUE. L3 cards are too expensive. So no RED bonus cards are affordable. Reserving a card? Deck_level options: reserving LEVEL_2 might get a RED bonus card, but I have no gold (GOLD=0), and board has no face-up RED bonus cards except L2_66 (not reserve-able, only purchase). Given no better purchase/reserve options, taking 2 GREEN is the only legal token action, even if suboptimal. It keeps me active and may help with L2_44 if needed later, but primarily fills the turn.

My goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I need 2 more RED bonuses. The target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=4 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=6, covers cost), BLACK=2 (need 3 → short 1). Board token availability: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=4, RED=0, BLACK=0, GOLD=4. All non-GOLD colors except WHITE and GREEN have 0 tokens. I cannot take BLUE, RED, or BLACK because they are unavailable (0 on board). The only available colors to take are WHITE (2), GREEN (4). But I must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of the same. Since BLUE=RED=BLACK=0, I cannot form a 3-color combination that includes any of those. GREEN has 4 tokens, so I can legally take 2 GREEN tokens (since ≥4 available). This is the only valid token action possible. Although I have GREEN bonus=4 and rarely need GREEN tokens, this is the only legal move: take 2 GREEN. Total tokens would be 10 + 2 = 12, which exceeds 10, so I must return 2 tokens. Which to return? BLUE=2 (I need 1 more BLUE for L2_66, but board has 0 BLUE now, so holding BLUE is not immediately useful, but I should keep it for when BLUE appears). BLACK=2 (I need 1 more BLACK for L2_66; same as BLUE, should preserve). RED=4 (useful for RED costs, and I have high RED tokens; but no immediate RED cost cards). WHITE=2 (I have WHITE bonus=1; WHITE tokens are less critical, and board has WHITE=2, so I can reacquire). Best to return WHITE=2: they are the least critical right now. After returning WHITE=2 (WHITE=0), take GREEN=2: tokens become WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=2 (total=10). This is legal and the only possible token action given board constraints.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=2}]

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=1, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **TURN 26: EXECUTE PLANNED L2_69 PRESTIGE ACQUISITION**

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My prestige: 8/15 (53% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (5/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved: L2_69 (BLACK:5 cost, 2 prestige, RED bonus), L2_62, L2_46
- Board tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:4
- Opponent: 10/10 tokens MAXED (at turn cap, cannot take tokens)

**BOARD CONSTRAINT CHECK:**
Token availability for taking:
- Only 2 non-GOLD colors available (WHITE:4, GREEN:2)
- Cannot form 3 different colors → TAKE_TOKENS IMPOSSIBLE
- GREEN:2 < 4 (minimum for 2 same color) → Cannot take 2 of same color either
- CONCLUSION: Token acquisition is blocked

**L2_69 AFFORDABILITY - FINAL VERIFICATION:**
Reserved card L2_69:
- Base cost: BLACK:5
- My BLACK:2 bonus reduces effective cost: BLACK:5 - BLACK:2 = BLACK:3
- My current inventory: BLACK:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (wildcard)
- Payment capability: BLACK:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (acts as BLACK wildcard) = BLACK:3 ✓
- STATUS: IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE

**PURCHASE L2_69 - PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH:**
Executing reserved purchase:
- Prestige gain: +2 (8 → 10/15, reaching 67% victory threshold)
- New bonus acquired: RED:1 (enabling N10 noble path if tokens available)
- Tokens consumed: BLACK:2 + GOLD:1 (3 tokens total)
- Tokens remaining: BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0 (2/10, excellent capacity)
- Lead established: 10 vs opponent's 5 = **+5 PRESTIGE INSURMOUNTABLE ADVANTAGE**

**STRATEGIC IMPACT - VICTORY PATHWAY:**

1. **Prestige Margin Analysis:**
   - After this purchase: I have 10/15 prestige (67% victory)
   - Opponent at 5/15 prestige (33% victory)
   - Opponent would need to gain 6 prestige to tie me at 11
   - Realistic opponent prestige ceiling: 7-8 (via 1-2 card purchases)
   - I cannot be caught, mathematically impossible

2. **Victory Timeline Acceleration:**
   - Current prestige: 10/15 (only 5 points remaining)
   - N10 noble path is 67% complete (R:1/3, W:0/3, K:0/3 - need W:3, K:3, R:2 more)
   - Alternative card paths:
     - L2_62 (reserved, 2 prestige): BLUE:3 effective + GREEN:2 effective → Could accumulate tokens for this
     - L3_84 (BLUE:7): Achievable in 2-3 turns with token accumulation (BLUE bonus helps)
   - Conservative estimate: Victory by turn 28-29

3. **Opponent's Forced Response (Turn 26 - opponent):**
   - At 10/10 tokens maxed, opponent MUST purchase or reserve
   - Prestige cards unaffordable (L2_66 SHORT K:1, L2_42 SHORT K:1, L2_44 SHORT R:1+K:1)
   - Likely purchases low-value L1 card to free token space
   - Prestige: Likely unchanged at 5 (or +1 if L1 card offers prestige, impossible)
   - By end of opponent's turn: Still 5 prestige, I remain at 10+!

4. **Token Flexibility Post-Purchase:**
   - After spending 3 tokens, I have 2/10 capacity
   - Excellent position to take 3 tokens next turn (if board provides variety after refresh)
   - Can build toward either N10 noble (if RED/WHITE/BLACK tokens return) or L2_62/L3 cards

**RED BONUS UPGRADE SIGNIFICANCE:**
New RED:1 bonus (from L2_69 card) enables:
- N10 noble (R:3, W:3, K:3): Currently have R:0, W:0, K:0. With RED:1 bonus, effective cost drops. Still need to accumulate tokens, but pathway is now open.
- L2_66 (1 prestige, RED bonus): RED:1 bonus means future RED cards become cheaper
- L2_44 (2 prestige, GREEN:5+RED:3): RED:1 bonus reduces to RED:2 effective (still high, but progress)

**REVISED VICTORY PROJECTION (TURNS 27-29):**
- Turn 27 (opponent): Forced action. Likely purchases L1 card for tokens. Prestige stays ~5
- Turn 27 (my turn): Board has refreshed. If market offers variety, take 3 tokens. Accumulate toward L2_62/N10
- Turn 28 (my turn): Prestige card purchase or noble claim (10→12 or 10→13)
- Turn 29 (my turn): Final prestige accumulation → 15 prestige VICTORY

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on reserved card
✓ Card exists: L2_69 in my reserved hand
✓ Cost calculation: Base BLACK:5 - BLACK:2 bonus = BLACK:3 effective
✓ Payment method: BLACK:2 (physical) + GOLD:1 (wildcard) = BLACK:3 ✓
✓ Token sufficiency: 5 tokens available, spending 3 = 2 remaining ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No illegal token returns
✓ Card moves from reserved to purchased collection
✓ Bonus: RED:1 added to my collection (RED:0 → RED:1)

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_69 using BLACK:2 + GOLD:1 payment. Prestige 8→10 (67% victory), establish +5 insurmountable lead, lock in victory by turn 29.**
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_69]

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=6, RED=6, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=2 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. My score is 5. My goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I need 2 more RED bonuses. The target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=4 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=6, covers cost), BLACK=2 (need 3 → short 1). Board token availability: WHITE=4, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=2, GOLD=5. BLUE and RED are unavailable (0 on board), but BLACK=2 and WHITE=4 are available. I cannot take 2 BLACK (only 2 available, <4 required for doubling). So I must take 3 different colors. Available colors: WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. I need BLACK for L2_66, so include BLACK. GREEN=2 is available; I have GREEN bonus=4, so GREEN tokens are low priority but usable as filler. WHITE=4 is available; I have WHITE bonus=1, so extra WHITE is low priority but acceptable. Taking WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (1 each) is the only valid 3-color combination. However, I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return 3 tokens. Current tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=2. Least critical tokens: GREEN=2 (bonus=4 makes GREEN tokens almost useless; I haven’t needed them since buying L2_64/L2_63). RED=4 is useful but not urgent (no immediate RED cost cards beyond L2_66, which is already affordable in RED). BLUE=2 and BLACK=2 are critical for L2_66 (need 1 more each), so preserve them. Best to return GREEN=2 and 1 RED: GREEN=2-2=0, RED=4-1=3. Then take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1: tokens become WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=3 (total=10). Now BLACK=3 (meets L2_66’s BLACK=3 requirement), BLUE=2 (still short 1, but BLACK is now ready). This is optimal to progress toward L2_66.

Turn 27 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 27: STRATEGIC TOKEN ACCUMULATION FOR ENDGAME PRESTIGE ACQUISITION

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 10/15 (67% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- My lead: +5 prestige (INSURMOUNTABLE - opponent cannot mathematically catch up even with optimal plays)
- My tokens: BLUE:2 only (2/10 capacity) - Excellent accumulation space
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved: L2_62 (2 prestige), L2_46 (3 prestige)
- Opponent: W:1, B:2, G:1, R:3, K:3 (10/10 MAXED - forced to purchase or reserve next turn)

**BOARD STATE:**
Available tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

**PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY CHECK:**

1. L2_66 (1 prestige, B:3+R:2+K:3): Effective cost B:1+R:1+K:3. I need K:3 but have K:0 → SHORT K:3 ✗
2. L2_42 (1 prestige, W:3+G:3+K:2): Have W:0, G:0, K:0 → SHORT all ✗
3. L2_44 (2 prestige, G:5+R:3): Have G:0, R:0 → SHORT all ✗
4. L2_60 (1 prestige, W:2+B:3+K:2): Effective B:3+K:2. Have B:2, K:0 → SHORT B:1, K:2 ✗
5. L2_46 (3 prestige, K:6): Effective K:4 with BLACK:2 bonus. Have K:0 → SHORT K:4 ✗
6. L2_62 (2 prestige, B:5+G:3): Effective B:3+G:2. Have B:2, G:0 → SHORT B:1, G:2 ✗
7. L3_75 (3 prestige, W:3+G:3+R:3+K:5): Have W:0, G:0, R:0, K:0 → SHORT all ✗
8. L3_81 (4 prestige, W:3+R:3+K:6): Have W:0, R:0, K:0 → SHORT all ✗
9. L3_84 (4 prestige, B:7): Have B:2, SHORT B:5 ✗ (but achievable over 2-3 more turns with token accumulation)

**CONCLUSION: NO PRESTIGE CARD IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE**

All prestige cards require resources I don't currently possess. However, I can optimize token acquisition for TURN 28+.

**TAKE_TOKENS ANALYSIS:**

Board has 3 distinct non-GOLD colors available: WHITE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1

Valid token-taking options:
- **Option A**: Take WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (3 different colors) ✓ LEGAL
- **Option B**: Take WHITE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (3 different colors) ✓ LEGAL (alternative)
- **Option C**: Take same color (requires 4+ available, none qualify) ✗ ILLEGAL

**OPTIMAL CHOICE: Option A (WHITE, GREEN, RED)**

Reasoning:
1. **Token capacity**: I have 2/10 tokens, can absorb 3 more (2+3=5/10)
2. **No returns required**: 5 tokens ≤ 10 maximum
3. **Preserves flexibility**: After this move, I'll have W:1, B:2, G:1, R:1 (5/10 tokens, 5-token buffer for next moves)
4. **Advances endgame**: Diversified token portfolio (BLUE:2 from before + new tokens) enables future prestige card purchases
5. **Better than alternatives**:
   - Reserve card: Gets only GOLD:1 (still SHORT on major resources for prestige cards, wastes tempo)
   - Purchase non-prestige card: Doesn't advance toward victory, delays prestige acquisition

**PROJECTION - TURN 28 (OPPONENT'S TURN):**
- Opponent at 10/10 tokens maxed, FORCED to purchase or reserve
- Opponent cannot afford prestige cards (all SHORT on KEY resources)
- Board likely refreshes with new token offerings

**PROJECTION - TURN 29 (MY TURN):**
- After board refresh, board tokens include new color distributions
- If BLUE tokens reappear: Accumulate more BLUE (have B:2, need B:5 more for L3_84)
- If BLACK or other useful tokens appear: Reassess prestige card accessibility
- Likely action: Additional token accumulation or prestige card purchase if conditions enable

**VICTORY TIMELINE:**
- Current prestige: 10/15 (67% victory, 5 points remaining)
- L3_84 path: 10 + 4 (card) = 14. Then need 1 more prestige.
- Alternative: L2_44 (2) + L2_66 (1) + L2_42 (1) = 4, reaching 14. Then 1 more.
- Conservative estimate: Victory by Turn 30-31 (secured by Turn 29-30)
- Opponent can realistically reach 7-8 prestige maximum before I cross 15, leaving me winner by 6-8 points

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ TAKE_TOKENS action with 3 different colors (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1)
✓ All colors available on board: WHITE:3≥1, GREEN:3≥1, RED:1≥1
✓ No overage: Current 2 + new 3 = 5 ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No returns needed
✓ Legal token combination

**FINAL DECISION: Take WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. Accumulate toward L3_84 or other prestige cards on Turn 28+. Maintain dominance with +5 prestige lead while positioning for endgame victory.**

======================================================================================

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=5, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=3 (total = 10). My bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, and my score is 5. My goal is to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (already met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I currently have RED=2, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. The card L2_66 provides 1 RED bonus and 1 prestige point, costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. Let's verify affordability: BLUE cost=3; I have BLUE=2 tokens + BLUE bonus=0 → short 1 BLUE. Wait—this is a critical error. In my previous turn, I assumed BLUE=2 was sufficient, but L2_66 requires BLUE=3, and I have no BLUE bonus (my bonuses are WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2). So I cannot afford L2_66 yet. What other options exist? Check affordable cards. L1_3: cost WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1. I have WHITE=1+1=2 (token+bonus), BLUE=2, RED=3 → can pay WHITE=2 (1 token +1 bonus), BLUE=2, RED=1. This is affordable. L1_3 gives BLACK bonus (0 pts), which is not helpful for N2. L1_10: cost WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. I have all: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=3 → affordable, but gives BLUE bonus (0 pts), irrelevant. L1_29: cost WHITE=2, BLUE=1. I have WHITE=1+1=2, BLUE=2 → affordable, gives GREEN bonus (0 pts; I already have GREEN=4, so redundant). L1_23: cost BLUE=3. I have BLUE=2 → cannot afford. L2_42: cost WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2. I have WHITE=1+1=2 (short 1), GREEN=1+4=5 (covers 3), BLACK=3 → short 1 WHITE. L2_44: cost GREEN=5, RED=3. I have GREEN=1+4=5, RED=3 → affordable! L2_44 gives BLACK bonus and 2 prestige points. But I need RED bonuses, not BLACK. However, buying L2_44 would increase my score to 7 and give BLACK=1 bonus (total BLACK=1), but doesn’t help with N2. L2_60: cost WHITE=2, BLUE=3, BLACK=2. I have WHITE=1+1=2, BLUE=2 (short 1), BLACK=3 → cannot afford. L3 cards are too expensive. Since I can’t buy L2_66 (short 1 BLUE), I must collect BLUE. Board tokens: BLUE=0, so I cannot take BLUE now. Available colors: WHITE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=1. I must take 3 different colors (no color has ≥4 for doubling). Taking WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (1 each) is the only option. But I’m at 10 tokens, so I need to return 3. Current tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=3. Least critical: BLUE=2 (need for L2_66, but board has 0, so holding is necessary), BLACK=3 (already meets L2_66’s BLACK=3, so excess), RED=3 (useful for RED costs, but I have RED bonus=2). Best to return BLACK=2 and GREEN=1: BLACK=3-2=1, GREEN=1-1=0. Then take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1: tokens become WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (total=10). But this doesn’t help with BLUE. Alternatively, return RED=3 (I have RED bonus=2, so RED tokens are less critical) and take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. After returning RED=3: tokens=WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=3 (total=7). Take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=4 (total=10). Still no BLUE. Since BLUE is unavailable, the only productive action is to buy an affordable card to reduce tokens and gain points/bonuses. L2_44 is affordable: cost GREEN=5, RED=3. My GREEN tokens=1, but GREEN bonus=4 → total GREEN=5, which covers GREEN=5 cost. RED tokens=3 covers RED=3 cost. So I can buy L2_44! This gives 2 prestige points (score=7) and BLACK bonus (bonuses: BLACK=1). Although it doesn’t help with N2, it increases my score and uses excess tokens. This is better than taking tokens and returning, as it productively burns tokens. Verifying: L2_44 cost is GREEN=5, RED=3. My GREEN: tokens=1 + bonus=4 =5 ≥5. RED: tokens=3 + bonus=2=5 ≥3. Yes, affordable. So purchase L2_44.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_66]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_66
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=3 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. My score is 5. My goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I need 2 more RED bonuses. The target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=3 tokens (plus RED bonus=2 → effective RED=5, which covers the RED=2 cost), and BLACK=3 (exactly meets BLACK=3 requirement). So I only need 1 more BLUE token to afford L2_66. However, the board shows BLUE=0 tokens available, so I cannot take BLUE now. Other available token colors: WHITE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=1. I cannot take 2 of any color because only GREEN=2 and WHITE=2 are available (need ≥4 to take 2). So I must take 3 different colors. The only available colors are WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. I already have BLACK=3, so more BLACK is unnecessary. GREEN=1 token is held, but GREEN bonus=4 makes GREEN tokens rarely useful. WHITE=1 token + 1 bonus; extra WHITE is low priority. However, I cannot progress toward BLUE (unavailable), so I must wait. But I cannot take a legal token action that helps L2_66. Alternatively, check if any other card can be purchased. L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1. I have WHITE=1 (need 2 → short 1), BLUE=2, RED=3 → with WHITE bonus=1, effective WHITE=2, so I can afford L1_3: WHITE cost 2 - 1 bonus = 1 token needed (I have 1), BLUE=2 (I have 2), RED=1 (I have 3). Purchasing L1_3 (0 pts, BLACK bonus) would give me a BLACK bonus (not helpful for N2), but it would reduce my token count, allowing me to collect BLUE next turn when it appears. Current tokens: 10. Buying L1_3 uses WHITE=1, BLUE=2, RED=1 → tokens become WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total=6). This is beneficial: frees up token capacity and gets a card (though low value). It’s better than returning tokens to take useless colors. Yes, L1_3 is face-up and purchasable. This is the correct move.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=3 (total = 10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. My score is 5. My goal is still to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (met) and RED=4 in bonuses. I need 2 more RED bonuses. The best path is buying L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I now have BLACK=3 (meets requirement), RED=3 tokens (plus RED=2 bonus = effective RED=5 ≥ 2), but BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1). Board token availability: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=5. BLUE and RED are unavailable (0 on board), so I cannot collect BLUE now. The only available colors are WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. I cannot double any color: WHITE=2 (<4), GREEN=2 (<4), BLACK=1 (<4). So I must take 3 different colors. I need to keep BLUE=2 and BLACK=3 (critical for L2_66), so I should not return them. GREEN=1 is low priority (bonus=4), RED=3 is useful but not urgent. The only valid 3-color combination is WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (1 each). But I’m at 10 tokens, so I must return 3 tokens. Least critical: GREEN=1 (almost useless), WHITE=1 (low priority), and maybe 1 RED (since I have RED=3 and effective RED is high). Returning GREEN=1, WHITE=1, and RED=1: after return, tokens = WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total=7). Then take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1: final tokens = WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4 (total=10). This preserves BLUE=2 and gets BLACK=4 (still sufficient for L2_66). However, BLACK=1 on board means taking BLACK=1 is possible. But wait — the key issue: BLUE is unavailable, so I cannot progress on L2_66 this turn. Alternatively, is there a purchasable card? Check affordable cards: L1_3 costs WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1 — I have WHITE=1 (need 2), BLUE=2, RED=3 → short 1 WHITE. L1_10: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 — I have all, but it gives BLUE bonus (not needed; I need RED). L1_29: WHITE=2, BLUE=1 — short 1 WHITE. L1_23: BLUE=3 — I have BLUE=2, short 1. L2_42: WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2 — I have WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=3 → short WHITE and GREEN. L2_44: GREEN=5, RED=3 — I have GREEN=1 (bonus=4 → effective GREEN=5), RED=3 → can afford! L2_44 costs GREEN=5, RED=3. My GREEN bonus=4, so I need 1 GREEN token (I have GREEN=1), and RED=3 tokens (I have RED=3). Total cost: GREEN tokens needed = 5 - 4 = 1 (I have 1), RED tokens = 3 (I have 3). So I can purchase L2_44! It gives BLACK bonus and 2 prestige points. But I need RED bonuses, not BLACK. However, buying it would reduce my tokens (free up space) and give 2 points (score=7). But it doesn’t help with RED=4 for N2. L2_66 is still the priority. Since I can’t collect BLUE, and purchasing L2_44 is a distraction, I should take tokens to stay flexible. But the only legal token move is 3 different colors: WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. And I must return 3 tokens. The previous error was likely not setting take_* fields. So I will take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1, and return WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 to stay at 10 tokens.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}]

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: **TURN 28: ENDGAME TOKEN ACCUMULATION PHASE**

**CURRENT CRITICAL STATE:**
- My prestige: 10/15 (67% victory) vs opponent: 5/15 (33%)
- My lead: +5 INSURMOUNTABLE (opponent mathematically cannot catch up)
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1 (5/10 tokens, excellent accumulation space)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved: L2_62 (2 prestige), L2_46 (3 prestige)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:5

**PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY CHECK - ALL CURRENT BOARD OPTIONS:**

1. L2_44 (2 prestige, BLACK:5+RED:3): Effective G:4+R:3 with bonuses. Have G:1, R:1 → SHORT G:3, R:2 ✗
2. L2_66 (1 prestige, BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3): Effective B:1+R:2+K:3. Have B:2✓, R:1✗, K:0✗ → SHORT K:3 ✗
3. L2_42 (1 prestige, WHITE:3+GREEN:3+BLACK:2): Effective W:1+G:2+K:2. Have W:1✓, G:1✗, K:0✗ → SHORT K:2 ✗
4. L2_60 (1 prestige, WHITE:2+BLUE:3+BLACK:2): Effective W:0+B:1+K:2. Have B:2✓, K:0✗ → SHORT K:2 ✗
5. L3_84 (4 prestige, BLUE:7): Effective B:5 with BLUE:2 bonus. Have B:2 → SHORT B:3 ✗
6. Reserved L2_62 (BLUE:5+GREEN:3): Effective B:3+G:2 with bonuses. Have B:2, G:1 → SHORT B:1, G:1 ✗

**CRITICAL BLOCKER ANALYSIS:**
All prestige cards require BLACK gem costs (K tokens), and board has K:0 available. This is the universal bottleneck preventing immediate prestige acquisition.

**TAKE_TOKENS ANALYSIS:**
Board non-GOLD colors available: WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1 (3 distinct colors)
- Option: Take WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (3 different, exactly 1 each) ✓ LEGAL
- Current tokens: 5/10
- After taking: W:1+1=2, B:2, G:1+1=2, R:1+1=2, K:0 = 8/10 tokens
- No overage, no returns needed
- Excellent accumulation buffer (2/10 capacity remaining)

**STRATEGIC RATIONALE FOR TOKEN ACCUMULATION:**

1. **Board Refresh Incoming**: After my action, opponent's turn will trigger board refresh (new cards, token distributions shift)
2. **Token Diversity Maximized**: W:2, B:2, G:2, R:2 provides maximum flexibility for new card options
3. **Prestige Card Probability**: High likelihood that new prestige cards appear post-refresh that are more affordable with diversified token base
4. **Projection Turn 29+ (Opponent's Turn)**:
   - Board refreshes with new card distribution
   - New cards may include prestige options affordable with W:2+B:2+G:2+R:2 token base
   - Potential: New RED-bonus card (I need for N10 noble), new prestige cards with mixed costs
5. **Projection Turn 30 (My Next Turn)**:
   - Reevaluate prestige card affordability with refreshed board
   - If new prestige card costs G:3+R:2 (example): Can cover with G:2+GOLD or R:2 directly
   - Expected prestige gain: +2 or +3 via purchasing new card
   - Prestige progression: 10→12/13→15 within 2-3 more turns

**TEMPO ANALYSIS:**
Non-prestige L1 card purchases (L1_3, L1_23, L1_10) would:
- Consume 1 action (no prestige gain this turn)
- Reduce token count or maintain it
- Delay prestige accumulation by 1 turn
- Less efficient than pure token accumulation

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ TAKE_TOKENS with exactly 3 different colors (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1)
✓ All colors available on board: WHITE:2≥1, GREEN:2≥1, RED:1≥1
✓ Legal token combination (not 1 token, not 2 colors, not same color without 4+ availability)
✓ Token total after action: 5+3=8≤10 maximum
✓ No returns required
✓ Action positions for prestige victory by Turn 30-31

**FINAL DECISION: Take WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. Maximize token accumulation (5→8 tokens, 8/10 capacity). Position for prestige card purchases on Turn 30 after board refresh. Maintain +5 lead while building toward 15-prestige victory.**
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 29 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4 (total=10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. My score is 5. My primary goal remains qualifying for Noble N2 (3 pts), which requires GREEN=4 (met) and RED=4 in bonuses (I have RED=2, need 2 more). The main target has been L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I now have BLACK=4 (≥3), RED=2 tokens (plus RED=2 bonus = effective RED=4 ≥2), but BLUE=2 (<3), and BLUE=0 on the board, so I cannot collect BLUE to afford L2_66 this turn. However, I must check for other purchasable cards to reduce my token count (currently at 10, which is restrictive) and potentially gain points or bonuses. L2_44 costs GREEN=5, RED=3. My GREEN bonus=4, so I need 1 GREEN token (I have GREEN=1), and RED=3 tokens (I have RED=2). Wait—I previously thought I had RED=3, but the current state shows RED=2 tokens. So RED=2 is insufficient for L2_44’s RED=3 cost. Correction: I cannot afford L2_44. Other cards: L1_10 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. I have WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4—all sufficient. L1_10 gives BLUE bonus (not needed, as I need RED bonuses), but purchasing it would free up 4 tokens (WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1), reducing my total to 6 tokens, creating flexibility. However, it doesn’t help with RED=4 for N2. L1_3: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, RED=1—I have WHITE=1 (short 1). L1_29: WHITE=2, BLUE=1—short 1 WHITE. L1_23: BLUE=3—short 1 BLUE. L2_42: WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2—short WHITE and GREEN. L2_60: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, BLACK=2—short WHITE and BLUE. No other RED-bonus cards are affordable. Since I cannot buy any RED-bonus cards and cannot collect BLUE (0 on board), the only legal token action is to take 3 different colors from available tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=0, RED=0, BLUE=0. Available colors are only WHITE and GREEN (BLACK=0, so cannot take BLACK). But I need 3 different colors to take tokens, and only 2 colors (WHITE, GREEN) are available with ≥1 token. This means I cannot take 3 different colors. Can I double a color? WHITE=1 (<4), GREEN=1 (<4)—no. Thus, taking tokens is impossible. The only remaining option is to purchase a card to reduce tokens. L1_10 is affordable: cost WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. I have exactly those tokens. Purchasing L1_10 gives a BLUE bonus (not ideal) but reduces my tokens by 4, freeing up space for future BLUE collection when available. This is better than being stuck with no legal actions. I must purchase L1_10.

Reasoning: **TURN 29: PRESTIGE ACCELERATION TO NEAR-VICTORY THRESHOLD**

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My prestige: 10/15 (67% victory, lead of +3)
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:4 (8/10 capacity)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved: L2_62 (2 prestige), L2_46 (3 prestige)
- Opponent: 7/15 prestige (47% victory)
- Board: W:1, B:0, G:2, R:1, K:0, GOLD:5

**CRITICAL AFFORDABILITY CHECK - ALL PRESTIGE CARDS:**

1. **L2_66** (1 prestige, B:3+R:2+K:3):
   - My bonuses: BLUE:2, RED:1, BLACK:0
   - Effective cost: B:(3-2)+R:(2-1)+K:3 = B:1+R:1+K:3
   - Have: B:2✓, R:1✓, K:4✓ → AFFORDABLE ($1 prestige only)

2. **L2_60** (1 prestige, W:2+B:3+K:2):
   - Effective cost: W:(2-2)+B:(3-2)+K:2 = W:0+B:1+K:2
   - Have: B:2✓, K:4✓ → AFFORDABLE ($1 prestige only)

3. **L2_46 (RESERVED)** (3 prestige, K:6):
   - My BLACK:2 bonus reduces: K:(6-2) = K:4
   - Have: K:4 ✓ EXACTLY SUFFICIENT
   - STATUS: **IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE FOR +3 PRESTIGE**

4. **L3_84, L3_81, L3_88, L3_75, L2_42, L2_47**: All SHORT critical resources (GREEN, BLUE, WHITE, or BLACK)

5. **L2_62 (Reserved)** (2 prestige, B:5+G:3):
   - Effective: B:(5-2)+G:(3-1) = B:3+G:2
   - Have: B:2 (SHORT B:1), G:0 (SHORT G:2) → NOT AFFORDABLE

**BREAKTHROUGH: PURCHASE L2_46 FROM RESERVED HAND**

L2_46 cost breakdown:
- Card: L2_46 (BLACK:6 requirement, 3 prestige, BLACK bonus)
- My BLACK:2 bonus: Reduces effective cost from 6 to 4
- Payment capability: Have BLACK:4 tokens ✓
- Token consumption: 4 of my 8 tokens
- Remaining after: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0 = 4/10 tokens
- Prestige gain: +3 (10 → **13/15**)

**STRATEGIC IMPACT - NEAR-CERTAIN VICTORY:**

1. **Victory Proximity:**
   - Current: 13/15 prestige (86% complete)
   - Only need: 2 more prestige to win
   - Next realistic purchase: Any 1-prestige card (L2_66, L2_60) = 14
   - Then: One more 1-prestige card = 15 VICTORY

2. **Opponent Recovery Analysis:**
   - Opponent at 7/15 prestige
   - To catch my 13, opponent needs +6 prestige
   - Available prestige on board: L2_66(1), L2_60(1), L2_47(1), plus any Level 3 cards opponent can afford
   - Even if opponent chains maximum purchases (unlikely given board constraints), they cannot reach 13 before I cross 15
   - MATHEMATICALLY UNBEATABLE POSITION

3. **Victory Timeline (Conservative):**
   - Turn 30 (opponent): Worst case purchases L2_66 → 7→8 prestige
   - Turn 30 (my turn): Take tokens or purchase L2_60 → 13→14 prestige
   - Turn 31 (my turn): Purchase any remaining prestige card → 14→15 VICTORY
   - Opponent cannot prevent this path

4. **Bonus Upgrade Value:**
   - L2_46 grants BLACK bonus → BLACK:2 + BLACK:1 = BLACK:3
   - Strengthens future BLACK card chains if extended play becomes necessary
   - Currently not critical, but increases card acquisition flexibility

**WHY NOT OTHER OPTIONS?**

**TAKE_TOKENS Alternative:** 
- Board available: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1 (only 3 colors)
- Option: WHITE:1+GREEN:1+RED:1 = 3 tokens
- Current: 8 tokens. After taking: 11 tokens → OVERAGE 1 token
- Would need to RETURN 1 token (inefficient, wastes tempo)
- Verdict: Inferior to prestige accumulation. Does not advance toward 15-prestige victory.

**PURCHASE L2_66/L2_60:** 
- Prestige gain: Only +1 each
- Leaves me at 11/15 (still need 4 more prestige)
- Allows opponent additional turns to purchase cards
- Less decisive than L2_46's +3 leap

**RESERVE_CARD:**
- Gains GOLD:1 only (token utility, not prestige)
- Does not advance toward 15-prestige victory
- Wastes tempo when prestige accumulation is available

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD action on reserved card
✓ Card ID "L2_46" exists in my reserved hand
✓ Base cost: BLACK:6 confirmed
✓ My bonus: BLACK:2 reduces cost to BLACK:4 effective
✓ Payment: BLACK:4 tokens (exact amount available)
✓ Token calculation: Spend 4 of 8 = 4 remaining ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No illegal returns
✓ Prestige gain: 10 → 13 (+3 from L2_46 prestigePoints field)
✓ Bonus acquisition: BLACK bonus (moves card from reserved to purchased)

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_46. Prestige acceleration 10→13/15 (86% victory). Lock in unbeatable path to 15-prestige victory.**
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_46]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_46
Reasoning: TURN 29: PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH WITH L2_46 PURCHASE

**CRITICAL STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 10/15 vs opponent: 7/15
- My lead: +3 prestige (COMMANDING)
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:4 (8/10 capacity)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved cards: L2_62 (2 prestige), L2_46 (3 prestige, BLACK:6 cost)

**L2_46 AFFORDABILITY - FINAL VERIFICATION:**
Card: L2_46 (3 prestige, BLACK:6 base cost, BLACK bonus)
- My BLACK:2 bonus reduces effective cost: BLACK:6 - BLACK:2 = BLACK:4
- My current BLACK tokens: 4
- Status: EXACTLY AFFORDABLE ✓

**PURCHASE L2_46 - PRESTIGE ACCELERATION:**
- Prestige gain: +3 (10 → 13/15, reaching 87% victory threshold)
- New bonus: +BLACK:1 (current BLACK:2 → BLACK:3 total)
- Tokens consumed: BLACK:4 (exact payment, no waste)
- Tokens remaining: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:1 (4/10, excellent accumulation capacity)
- New prestige: 13/15 (only 2 points needed for victory!)
- New lead: 13 vs opponent's 7 = +6 (mathematically insurmountable)

**VICTORY PROJECTION - TURN 30:**
After this purchase, I am in UNSTOPPABLE position:
- Remaining prestige needed: 2 points
- Available affordable prestige cards next turn:
  - L2_66 (1 prestige): Effective cost BLUE:1+RED:1+BLACK:1. I have BLUE:2✓, RED:1✓, BLACK:4✓ → AFFORDABLE
  - L2_60 (1 prestige): Effective cost BLUE:1. I have BLUE:2✓ → AFFORDABLE
  - Multiple 1-prestige paths guarantee 14-15 prestige within 1 turn
- Opponent's realistic ceiling: 8-9 prestige maximum (insufficient to catch me at 14+)
- Victory timeline: Turn 30 (definitive)

**STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE LOCKED:**
- Turn 29 (now): Prestige 13/15 with +6 safe lead
- Turn 30 (my action): Purchase 1-2 prestige card → 14-15/15 VICTORY
- Even if opponent purchases maximum prestige card (L3_81 = 4 prestige, unaffordable) → ceiling 11 prestige
- I am mathematically unreachable after this turn

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on reserved hand card
✓ Card exists: L2_46 confirmed in reserved list
✓ Cost calculation: BLACK:6 - BLACK:2 bonus = BLACK:4 effective
✓ Payment tokens: BLACK:4 available, BLACK:4 required = exact match ✓
✓ Token total after purchase: 8 spent 4 = 4 remaining ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No illegal token returns
✓ Card transition: Reserved → Purchased valid

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_46 from reserved hand using BLACK:4 payment. Prestige 10→13/15 (87% victory), establish insurmountable +6 lead, lock in guaranteed victory by Turn 30.**
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_46]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_46
Reasoning: **TURN 29: PRESTIGE ACCELERATION THROUGH L2_47 PURCHASE**

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 10/15 (67% victory) vs opponent: 7/15 (47% victory)
- My lead: +3 prestige (COMMANDING POSITION)
- My tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2 (8/10)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved: L2_62 (2 prestige, BLUE:5+GREEN:3), L2_46 (3 prestige, BLACK:6)

**PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY MATRIX:**

Board prestige cards:
1. L2_66 (1 prestige, BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3): Effective B:1+R:1+K:3. Have B:2✓, R:2✓, K:0✗ → SHORT BLACK:3 ✗
2. L2_42 (1 prestige, WHITE:3+GREEN:3+BLACK:2): Effective W:1+G:2+K:2. Have W:2✓, G:2✓, K:0✗ → SHORT BLACK:2 ✗
3. L2_60 (1 prestige, WHITE:2+BLUE:3+BLACK:2): Effective W:0+B:1+K:2. Have B:2✓, K:0✗ → SHORT BLACK:2 ✗
4. **L2_47 (1 prestige, BLUE:2+GREEN:2+RED:3):** 
   - My bonuses reduce cost: BLUE:2 (fully covered), GREEN:1 (reduces cost 1), RED:1 (reduces cost 1)
   - Effective cost: BLUE:0 + GREEN:1 + RED:2
   - I have: BLUE:2✓, GREEN:2✓, RED:2✓ → **IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE** ✓

Level 3 cards:
- L3_84 (4 prestige, BLUE:7): Effective B:5 (with B:2 bonus). Have B:2 → SHORT B:3 ✗
- All others require BLACK tokens unavailable on board

Reserved cards:
- L2_62: Effective BLUE:3+GREEN:2. Have BLUE:2✗ → SHORT BLUE:1 ✗
- L2_46: Effective BLACK:4. Have BLACK:0 ✗

**CRITICAL FINDING - L2_47 BREAKTHROUGH:**
L2_47 is the ONLY immediately purchasable prestige card. This represents a direct +1 prestige gain and critical bonus upgrade.

**PAYMENT CALCULATION - L2_47:**
- Card cost: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3
- My bonuses: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1
- Tokens consumed: GREEN:1 (2 cost - 1 bonus), RED:2 (3 cost - 1 bonus). BLUE:0 (fully covered by bonus).
- Tokens remaining: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0 (3/10 total, 7-token capacity)
- No overage, no returns required ✓

**STRATEGIC IMPACT:**
1. **Immediate prestige advancement:** 10 → 11/15 (73% victory, only 4 points from victory)
2. **Bonus upgrade to BLUE:3:** Enables future L3_84 purchase (BLUE:7 effective becomes BLUE:4, achievable with token accumulation)
3. **Token efficiency:** Spend 3 tokens productively to free 5 capacity (8→3 tokens)
4. **Maintain lead:** After purchase, I'm 11 vs opponent's 7 = +4 prestige (insurmountable advantage)
5. **Victory projection:** Turn 30-31 victory highly probable
   - Next turn: Accumulate 3+ tokens from board
   - Turn 31: Purchase L2_62 (2 prestige, effective BLUE:3+GREEN:2) or L3_84 (4 prestige, effective BLUE:4 with upgrades)
   - Path to 15: 11 + 2 + 1 = 14, then final 1-prestige card finishes = 15

**ALTERNATIVE ACTION ANALYSIS:**
- TAKE_TOKENS: Board offers W:1, G:2, R:1 only. Taking W:1+G:1+R:1 = 3 tokens → 8+3=11/10 overflow. Inefficient return required. ✗
- RESERVE_CARD: Gains GOLD:1 only. Delays prestige acquisition by 1 turn. Inferior to immediate prestige gain. ✗
- PURCHASE non-prestige L1 cards (L1_29, L1_10, L1_3): Grants 0 prestige, wastes tempo. ✗

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on visible board card (L2_47 in LEVEL_2)
✓ Cost calculation verified: B:0 + G:1 + R:2 (effective after bonuses)
✓ Payment tokens sufficient: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2 available
✓ Spending 3 tokens on 8-token inventory = 5 remaining ≤ 10 maximum
✓ Prestige gain: +1 (confirmed on card)
✓ Bonus acquired: BLUE:1 (cumulative to BLUE:2→BLUE:3)

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_47. Achieve +1 prestige (10→11), upgrade BLUE bonus to enable endgame L3_84 path, lock in insurmountable +4 prestige lead. Victory by turn 31 secured.**

Turn 30 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=4 (total=8). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=1. My score is 7. My goal is to reach RED=4 in bonuses to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts). I need 2 more RED bonuses. The key target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=1 token (plus RED=2 bonus = effective RED=3 ≥2), BLACK=4 (≥3). Board token availability: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=0, GOLD=5. BLUE=0 on board, so I cannot collect BLUE yet. However, I can collect RED=3 (available) to ensure I have enough RED tokens for future RED-cost cards. I must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of the same. Available colors with ≥1 token: WHITE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3. I cannot double GREEN or RED (both have 3 <4). So I must take 3 different colors: WHITE, GREEN, RED (1 each). My current total tokens=8, so taking 3 brings me to 11, which exceeds 10. I must return 1 token. Which to return? BLUE=2 is critical for L2_66 (need 1 more when available), so preserve. BLACK=4 is excess (costs I face rarely need >3 BLACK), but returning 1 BLACK is possible. RED=1 is low (I’m about to take 1 RED), so keep. WHITE=1 and GREEN=0 are low priority (I have WHITE=1 bonus, GREEN=4 bonus). Best to return 1 BLACK: it’s the most abundant and least critical right now. After returning BLACK=1 (BLACK=3), take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1: tokens become WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total=10). This sets me up with RED=2 tokens (useful for RED costs) and keeps BLUE=2 ready for when BLUE appears on the board.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={BLACK=1}]

Turn 30 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 30: FREE PRESTIGE ACCELERATION THROUGH L2_60 PURCHASE

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- My prestige: 11/15 (73% victory) vs opponent: 7/15 (47% victory)
- My lead: +4 prestige (COMMANDING POSITION)
- My tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0 (5/10 total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved cards: L2_62 (2 prestige), L2_46 (3 prestige)
- Board tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

**PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY BREAKTHROUGH:**

Face-up prestige cards analysis:
1. L2_66 (1 prestige, BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3): Effective B:1+R:1+K:1. Have B:2✓, R:0✗ → SHORT ✗
2. L2_42 (1 prestige, WHITE:3+GREEN:3+BLACK:2): Effective W:1+G:2. Have W:2✓, G:1✗ → SHORT G:1 ✗
3. **L2_60 (1 prestige, WHITE:2+BLUE:3+BLACK:2):**
   - My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2
   - Effective cost: (WHITE:2-WHITE:2) + (BLUE:3-BLUE:3) + (BLACK:2-BLACK:2) = **ZERO TOKENS**
   - **IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE FOR FREE** ✓
4. L2_58 (3 prestige, WHITE:6): Effective W:4. Have W:2 → SHORT ✗
5. L3 cards (L3_81, L3_84, L3_88, L3_75): All multi-color or very high costs → SHORT on multiple resources ✗

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY - L2_60 IS COMPLETELY FREE:**
L2_60 costs WHITE:2+BLUE:3+BLACK:2. My permanent bonuses are exactly WHITE:2+BLUE:3+BLACK:2. Therefore, my bonuses fully cover all costs, and I purchase this card spending ZERO tokens.

**PAYMENT VERIFICATION - L2_60:**
- Card cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2
- My bonuses reduce cost: -WHITE:2, -BLUE:3, -BLACK:2
- Effective cost: 0 tokens
- Tokens consumed: 0
- Tokens remaining UNCHANGED: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1 (5/10 total)
- Prestige gain: +1 (11→12/15, 80% victory threshold)
- Bonus acquired: GREEN:1 (card grants this bonus)

**STRATEGIC MASTERSTROKE - CHAIN PRESTIGE PATH:**

1. **Turn 30 (now):** Purchase L2_60 for free → Prestige 12/15, GREEN bonus becomes 2
2. **After L2_60 purchase, L2_62 (reserved) becomes immediately affordable:**
   - L2_62 cost: BLUE:5+GREEN:3
   - My NEW bonuses: BLUE:3, GREEN:2 (after L2_60)
   - Effective cost: BLUE:2+GREEN:1
   - My tokens: BLUE:2✓, GREEN:1✓ → **IMMEDIATELY PURCHASABLE NEXT TURN**
3. **Turn 31+ (next opportunity):** Purchase L2_62 → Prestige 14/15 (93% victory)
4. **Turn 32+:** One final prestige acquisition (card or noble) → 15/15 VICTORY

**VICTORY PROJECTION:**
- Current: 11/15 (opponent at 7/15, +4 lead)
- After L2_60: 12/15 (+5 lead insurmountable)
- After L2_62: 14/15 (opponent cannot catch up even with 2 more prestige cards)
- Final: Victory by turn 32-33 secured

**WHY THIS ACTION IS OPTIMAL:**
- Zero token cost (all bonuses cover the purchase)
- Unlocks L2_62 chain (immediate follow-up prestige)
- Advances lead to +5 prestige (mathematical victory)
- Maintains token flexibility (5/10 capacity preserved)
- No opportunity cost (free action converting to prestige)

**ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS - ALL INFERIOR:**
- TAKE_TOKENS: Wastes turn, delays prestige, no value
- RESERVE_CARD: Gains only GOLD:1, inferior to direct prestige
- PURCHASE other cards: L2_42 SHORT GREEN:1, L2_66 SHORT RED+BLACK, L3s all unaffordable

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on visible board card L2_60 (LEVEL_2)
✓ Card exists: L2_60 confirmed in face-up cards
✓ Cost calculation: WHITE:(2-2)+BLUE:(3-3)+BLACK:(2-2) = 0 effective cost
✓ Payment: 0 tokens required (all covered by bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2)
✓ No overage (0 tokens spent, 5/10 remaining)
✓ No illegal returns
✓ Prestige confirmed: +1
✓ Bonus acquired: GREEN:1

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_60 using bonus reduction (effectively free). Prestige 11→12 (80% victory), acquire GREEN:1 bonus, unlock L2_62 immediate purchasability next turn. Lock in insurmountable victory path.**

Turn 31 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3 (total=10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=1. My score is 7. My goal is to reach RED=4 in bonuses to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts), requiring 2 more RED bonuses. The key target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (need 3 → short 1), RED=2 tokens (plus RED=2 bonus = effective RED=4 ≥2), BLACK=3 (meets requirement). Board token availability: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=5. BLUE=0 on board, so I cannot collect BLUE yet. I must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of the same. Available colors with ≥1 token: GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1. I cannot double GREEN or RED (both have 2 <4). So I must take 3 different colors: GREEN, RED, BLACK (1 each). My current total tokens=10, so taking 3 brings me to 13, which exceeds 10. I must return 3 tokens. Which to return? BLUE=2 is critical for L2_66 (need 1 more when available), so preserve. WHITE=2 is low priority (I have WHITE=1 bonus, and WHITE=0 on board means I can’t use WHITE soon). GREEN=1 is almost useless (bonus=4). RED=2 and BLACK=3 are useful but less critical than BLUE. Best to return WHITE=2 and GREEN=1: they are the least critical. After returning WHITE=2 (WHITE=0) and GREEN=1 (GREEN=0), take GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1: tokens become WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=4 (total=10). This preserves BLUE=2 for when BLUE appears and adds RED=1 to ensure RED token availability.

Turn 31 - Player 1's move
Points: 12, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 31: PURCHASE L2_62 FOR INSURMOUNTABLE VICTORY

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- My prestige: 12/15 (80% victory) vs opponent: 7/15 (47% victory)
- My lead: +5 prestige (MATHEMATICALLY INSURMOUNTABLE)
- My tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0 (5/10 total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved cards: L2_62 (2 prestige, BLUE:5+GREEN:3), L2_46 (3 prestige, BLACK:6)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:5

**L2_62 AFFORDABILITY - FINAL VERIFICATION:**

Reserved card L2_62:
- Base cost: BLUE:5, GREEN:3
- My bonuses: BLUE:3, GREEN:2
- Effective cost calculation:
  - BLUE: 5 - 3 (bonus) = 2 remaining
  - GREEN: 3 - 2 (bonus) = 1 remaining
  - Total effective: BLUE:2 + GREEN:1
- My current tokens: BLUE:2✓, GREEN:1✓
- STATUS: IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE ✓

**PAYMENT VERIFICATION - L2_62:**
- Tokens consumed: BLUE:2 (exact), GREEN:1 (exact)
- Tokens remaining: WHITE:2, RED:0, BLACK:0 (2/10 total, 8-token capacity)
- No overage, no returns required
- Prestige gain: +2 (12→14/15, 93% victory threshold)
- Bonus acquired: GREEN:1 (cumulative GREEN:2→GREEN:3)

**STRATEGIC BREAKTHROUGH - VICTORY LOCKED:**

1. **Prestige Advancement:**
   - After this purchase: 14/15 (93% victory, need only 1 more point)
   - Opponent at 7/15 (47% victory)
   - Opponent would need +7 prestige to tie at 14 (impossible in remaining turns)
   - Opponent would need +8 prestige to match my final 15 (impossible)

2. **Remaining Victory Path:**
   - Currently at 14/15 prestige
   - Need only +1 prestige point
   - Options available:
     - Any 1-prestige card (L2_48, L2_66, L2_42 if affordable on future turns)
     - Noble claim (N2: 3 prestige, N8: 3 prestige, N10: 3 prestige - all exceed 1 needed)
     - Reserved L2_46 (3 prestige - overkill, but available)
   - Conservative estimate: Victory by turn 32-33

3. **Opponent's Realistic Ceiling:**
   - Currently at 7/15 prestige
   - Realistic additional prestige available: 1-2 cards maximum
   - Opponent ceiling: 8-9 prestige maximum
   - I will finish at 15, opponent at ~8 max → Victory by 6-7 points

**WHY THIS ACTION IS OPTIMAL:**
- Direct prestige gain: +2 points (advancing from 12→14/15)
- Token efficiency: Consumes exactly BLUE:2+GREEN:1 (perfect fit for my inventory)
- No waste: All tokens used productively
- Unlocks bonus: GREEN:1 bonus upgrade to GREEN:3 (enables future L1/L2 purchases)
- Maintains capacity: Leaves 8/10 token capacity if needed
- Locks victory: +5 prestige lead establishes mathematical impossibility for opponent comeback

**ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS - ALL REJECTED:**

1. TAKE_TOKENS (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1):
   - Would accumulate to WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1 (8/10 tokens)
   - Effect: Delays prestige acquisition by 1 turn
   - Consequence: Wastes opportunity to lock 14/15 victory this turn
   - INFERIOR ✗

2. RESERVE_CARD:
   - Gains GOLD:1 only
   - Does not advance prestige
   - Delays winning by 1+ turns unnecessarily
   - INFERIOR ✗

3. PURCHASE other board prestige cards:
   - L2_48 (1 prestige, BLUE:2+GREEN:3+BLACK:3): Effective BLUE:0+GREEN:1+BLACK:3. SHORT BLACK:3 ✗
   - L2_66 (1 prestige, BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3): Effective BLUE:0+RED:1+BLACK:3. SHORT all ✗
   - L2_42 (1 prestige, WHITE:3+GREEN:3+BLACK:2): Effective WHITE:1+GREEN:1+BLACK:2. SHORT BLACK:2 ✗
   - None immediately affordable on board
   - INFERIOR ✗

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on reserved card
✓ Card exists: L2_62 in my reserved hand
✓ Cost calculation verified: BLUE:5-BLUE:3 = BLUE:2, GREEN:3-GREEN:2 = GREEN:1
✓ Payment method: BLUE:2 (physical) + GREEN:1 (physical) = sufficient
✓ Token sufficiency: 5 tokens available, spending 2 = 3 remaining ≤ 10 maximum
✓ No illegal token returns
✓ Card moves from reserved to purchased collection
✓ Prestige gain: +2 (confirmed on card)
✓ Bonus acquired: GREEN:1 (cumulative)

**VICTORY MATRIX AFTER THIS PURCHASE:**
- My prestige: 14/15 (need 1 more)
- Opponent: 7/15 (need 8 more)
- Lead established: +7 prestige
- Opponent catch-up probability: 0% (mathematically impossible)
- Expected victory turn: 32-33
- Final victory margin: +6 to +8 prestige points

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_62 from reserved hand using BLUE:2 + GREEN:1. Advance prestige from 12→14 (93% victory threshold), acquire GREEN:1 bonus upgrade, lock in insurmountable +7 prestige lead, secure victory by turn 33.**

Turn 32 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=5, RED=5, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I am player 0 with tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=4 (total=10). My bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=1. My score is 7. My goal is to reach RED=4 in bonuses to qualify for Noble N2 (3 pts), needing 2 more RED bonuses. The key target is L2_66 (1 pt, RED bonus), costing BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I currently have BLUE=2 (short 1), RED=3 tokens (effective RED=5 ≥2), BLACK=4 (≥3). Board token availability: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=0, GOLD=5. Crucially, BLUE is now available (2 on board), which was previously blocking me. However, I cannot take 2 BLUE tokens (only 2 available, <4 required for doubling). I must take 3 different colors. Available colors: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=1 (all ≥1). My priority is to collect BLUE to afford L2_66. So I need to include BLUE in my 3-color take. Other useful colors: RED=1 is available, and I have RED=3 tokens (sufficient, but extra RED is harmless). GREEN=3 is available, but I have GREEN=4 bonus, making GREEN tokens nearly useless. WHITE=2 is available, but I have WHITE=1 bonus and no immediate WHITE costs. The best combination is BLUE, RED, and WHITE: BLUE is critical, RED ensures I maintain RED token buffer, and WHITE is a filler (better than GREEN since WHITE has some utility in L2_58/N10, though low priority). Taking BLUE=1, RED=1, WHITE=1 totals 3 tokens. Since I’m at 10 tokens, I must return 3 tokens. Current tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=4. Least critical tokens: GREEN=1 (bonus=4 makes it useless), BLACK=4 (excess; I’ve never needed >3 BLACK), and maybe 1 RED (I have RED=3, taking 1 more makes 4, which is more than enough for RED costs). Best to return GREEN=1, BLACK=2 (GREEN=1 + BLACK=2 = 3 tokens). After return: GREEN=0, BLACK=2. Then take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1: final tokens = WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=4, BLACK=2 (total=10). Now BLUE=3 meets L2_66’s BLUE=3 cost, allowing me to purchase L2_66 next turn.

Turn 32 - Player 1's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 32: VICTORY THROUGH L2_42 PURCHASE - FINAL PRESTIGE POINT

**CRITICAL GAME STATE:**
- My prestige: 14/15 (93% victory, NEED +1 TO WIN)
- Opponent prestige: 7/15 (cannot catch up)
- My tokens: WHITE:2 only (2/10 capacity)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Reserved cards: L2_46 (3 prestige)

**VICTORY CONDITION CHECK - ALL PRESTIGE PATHS:**

1. **L2_42 (1 prestige, WHITE:3+GREEN:3+BLACK:2):**
   - My bonuses reduce cost: WHITE:2 (fully covers), GREEN:3 (fully covers), BLACK:2 (fully covers)
   - Effective cost: WHITE:(3-2) + GREEN:(3-3) + BLACK:(2-2) = WHITE:1 + GREEN:0 + BLACK:0
   - Total effective: WHITE:1
   - I have: WHITE:2 tokens ✓
   - **IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE** ✓
   - Prestige gain: +1 (14→15/15 = VICTORY)

2. **L2_66 (1 prestige, BLUE:3+RED:2+BLACK:3):**
   - Effective cost: BLUE:0 + RED:2 + BLACK:1 (after bonuses)
   - I have: RED:0, BLACK:0 tokens → SHORT both ✗

3. **L2_48 (1 prestige, BLUE:2+GREEN:3+BLACK:3):**
   - Effective cost: BLUE:0 + BLACK:1
   - I have: BLACK:0 tokens → SHORT ✗

4. **L2_58 (3 prestige, WHITE:6):**
   - Effective cost: WHITE:4
   - I have: WHITE:2 tokens → SHORT ✗

5. **N8 Noble (3 prestige, requires GREEN:3+BLUE:3+WHITE:3):**
   - My totals: GREEN:3 (bonus), BLUE:3 (bonus), WHITE:2 (bonus) + WHITE:2 (tokens) = WHITE:4
   - Meet all requirements ✓
   - But claiming requires a triggering purchase action
   - L2_42 purchase would also give +1 prestige, reaching 15 immediately
   - No need to overcomplicate

**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**
- I am one prestige point away from victory
- L2_42 is THE ONLY immediately purchasable prestige card on board
- Purchasing L2_42 gives exactly +1 prestige needed: 14 + 1 = 15/15 = VICTORY
- No opponent action can prevent this (opponent is maxed at 10/10 tokens, cannot catch up to 15 minimum needed to tie)
- No token management complications (effective cost WHITE:1, I have WHITE:2)

**WINNING MOVE CONFIRMATION:**
- Action: Purchase L2_42
- Cost: WHITE:1 (effective, after bonus reduction)
- Payment: WHITE:2 tokens (sufficient, using 1)
- Prestige gain: +1 (14 + 1 = 15/15)
- Result: VICTORY ON TURN 32

**RULE COMPLIANCE:**
✓ PURCHASE_CARD on visible board card (L2_42 in LEVEL_2)
✓ Card exists on board ✓
✓ Cost calculation verified: WHITE:1 effective (after subtracting WHITE:2 bonus)
✓ Payment tokens available: WHITE:2 ≥ WHITE:1 required ✓
✓ No token overage ✓
✓ Prestige gain: +1 confirmed on card ✓
✓ Achieves 15/15 prestige = VICTORY ✓

**FINAL DECISION: Purchase L2_42. Achieve +1 prestige (14→15), clinch victory on Turn 32. Game won!**
