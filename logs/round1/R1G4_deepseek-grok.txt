Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: As the first turn, I need to collect tokens to buy cards. L1_11 is a good early target as it provides a BLUE bonus and costs WHITE, GREEN, RED, which aligns with noble N9. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and RED tokens starts building towards this purchase. All these tokens are available on the board (each with 4 tokens), and since I have no tokens currently, I won't exceed the 10-token limit. This move diversifies my holdings efficiently for future purchases.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Early game, my first turn with 0 tokens. Cannot purchase any card as all Level 1 cards require at least 4 tokens. Reserving a card would give 1 gold but delay token acquisition. Optimal move is to TAKE_TOKENS: 3 different colors. Selected WHITE (frequent in costs: L1_34, L1_36, L1_11, L2_42, L3_85, L3_82), BLUE (in L1_34, L3_85, L3_89), BLACK (heavy demand: multiple Level 1/2 cards). Opponent holds WHITE/GREEN/RED, not these (except WHITE but supply ok). Board has WHITE:3, BLUE:4, BLACK:4 available. Current tokens 0, so no returns needed. This builds flexible hand for future Level 1 purchases or continued tokening.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: I previously took WHITE, GREEN, RED to target L1_11 (costs WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2). I now have 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. I need 1 more GREEN and 1 more RED to afford L1_11. The board shows WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:5. Taking GREEN and RED as a pair (2 of same color) is allowed because each has at least 4 tokens? Wait, the board shows 3 each, but my previous turn should have reduced them by 1 each? Actually, the board state likely reflects after my previous turn, since I took 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. Starting board had 4 each? Let's check: initial board would have 4 each of non-gold tokens. After my take, they'd be reduced by 1 each, so WHITE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3, but the board shows WHITE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3, BLACK:3. That means something else happened? Possibly opponent took WHITE? Actually opponent's tokens are WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, so opponent took WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. That explains: I took WHITE, GREEN, RED; opponent took WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. So board supply now: WHITE started 4, I took 1, opponent took 1 -> 2 left. BLUE started 4, opponent took 1 -> 3 left. GREEN started 4, I took 1 -> 3 left. RED started 4, I took 1 -> 3 left. BLACK started 4, opponent took 1 -> 3 left. So current board tokens are correct. To take 2 tokens of same color, I need at least 4 tokens available on board. Currently, no color has 4 tokens. So I cannot take 2 of same color. I must take 3 different colors. I have 3 tokens total (WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1). I want to build towards L1_11, which requires 1 more GREEN and 1 more RED. I could take GREEN and RED and a third color, but then I'd have 5 tokens total, still under 10, so no need to return. Which third color? Might as well take BLUE to start building for noble N9 (BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3) or for other cards. BLUE has 3 tokens available. So I can take GREEN, RED, BLUE. That gives me: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLUE=1. Then I can afford L1_11 next turn (costs WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2). That's perfect. So action: take GREEN=1, RED=1, BLUE=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Second turn, holding W1 B1 Bk1 (total 3). Cannot purchase any card: L1 cards cost 5 gems each, don't match hand. Cannot take 2 same (board max 3 Bk <4). Must take 3 different colors if tokening. Opponent holds W1 B1 G2 R2 (exact cost for L1_11), likely buys it next turn for BLUE bonus (ok, minor). Optimal: take WHITE1 GREEN1 RED1 (all board avail: W2,G2,R2). New hand: W2 B1 G1 Bk1 R1 (total 6). Next turn, buy L1_34 exactly (W2 B1 G1 Bk1, 0pt RED bonus), leftover R1. Efficient early bonus build toward higher cards/nobles (RED helps several costs). Reserving suboptimal (delays tokens, can't buy reserved soon). No token limit issue.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: I previously planned to purchase L1_11 as soon as I had enough tokens. After last turn's take, I now have: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2. L1_11 costs WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, which matches exactly. I have no bonuses yet, so I pay the full cost using tokens. I have exactly those tokens, so I can purchase it without using gold or needing to take more tokens. Purchasing now gives me a BLUE bonus (my first bonus) and moves me closer to noble N9 (requires BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3). It also reduces my token count by 5 (I spent 5 tokens), leaving me with only BLUE=1, so I'll have more room to take tokens next turn. This is efficient and progresses my engine.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 3, holding exactly W2 B1 G1 R1 Bk1 (total 6). Can purchase L1_34 perfectly (cost W2 B1 G1 Bk1, no bonuses needed). Gains RED bonus (0pt), leftover R1. RED bonus advances engine: helps L1_36 (W1 R1 Bk3, with RED bonus covers 1 Bk), L3_88/89, nobles N5/N9. Cannot afford other L1: L1_36 needs Bk3 (have1), L1_4 needs R3 Bk1 G1 (have R1 G1 Bk1, short R2), L1_2 needs B2 (have1). No L2/L3 possible. Tokening adds to hand (total9 max before return), but buying progresses score/engine faster. Opponent has BLUE bonus + B1, low threat. Post-buy: tokens R1, bonuses RED:1, ready for next buys/reserves. Optimal: buy now per prior plan.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card null not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: Turn 3, holding W2 B1 G1 R1 Bk1 (total 6). Exactly matches cost of L1_34 (W2 B1 G1 Bk1, bonus RED, 0pt). Perfect purchase: pay exactly, gain RED bonus for future cards/nobles (helps L1_36, L3_88, L3_89, N9). Leftover R1 token. No other L1 affordable exactly (L1_36 needs Bk3>1, L1_4 needs R3>1, L1_2 needs B2>1). Higher levels too expensive. Taking tokens suboptimal (have flexible hand now, buying builds engine). Reserving unnecessary with exact buy available. After buy: tokens R1, bonuses RED:1, score 0. Strong position to token next or buy more.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2}
Reasoning: I have just purchased L1_11, which cost me 5 tokens, leaving me with only 1 BLUE token. Now I need to collect tokens to buy more cards. I have 1 BLUE bonus. Looking at the face-up cards, I should consider cards that align with noble N9 (BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3) since I already have 1 BLUE bonus and will want to acquire more BLUE, GREEN, RED cards. Alternatively, I could consider cards that give GREEN or RED bonuses. Checking available cards: L1_36 costs WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=3 - I have no BLACK tokens, but could start collecting BLACK. L1_4 costs GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=1 - requires a lot of RED. L1_2 costs WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1 - I have BLUE bonus, but need more BLUE tokens. L1_6 costs WHITE=2, GREEN=2 - simple, but gives BLACK bonus (not aligned with N9). For level 2: L2_46 costs BLACK=6 - too expensive now. L2_56 costs RED=5, BLACK=3 - also expensive. L2_42 costs WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2 - possible but needs many tokens. L2_63 costs GREEN=5 - expensive. Level 3 cards are too expensive now. I should focus on affordable level 1 cards to build bonuses. My current tokens: BLUE=1. I can take 3 different colors. The board has: WHITE=4, BLUE=3, GREEN=4, RED=3, BLACK=4, GOLD=5. All non-gold colors have at least 3 tokens, so I can take any three different colors. I want to aim for a card that I can buy soon. L1_2 looks good: costs WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1. I have BLUE bonus=1, so effective cost: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. I currently have BLUE=1 token. If I take WHITE, GREEN, RED tokens now, I'll have: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLUE=1 (total 4 tokens). Then next turn I could buy L1_2 using my tokens plus bonus, spending 4 tokens and gaining a BLACK bonus. That would give me BLUE and BLACK bonuses, moving towards N9? Actually N9 needs BLUE, GREEN, RED, not BLACK. But having BLACK bonus could help with other cards. Alternatively, L1_6 costs WHITE=2, GREEN=2 - simpler, but gives BLACK bonus. I could take WHITE and GREEN now, but I need to take exactly 3 tokens of different colors or 2 of the same. I could take WHITE, GREEN, and RED as three different colors, which also helps with L1_2. L1_6 requires WHITE=2, GREEN=2, so I'd need more WHITE and GREEN. I think L1_2 is a better target because it uses more colors and gives a BLACK bonus, and I can afford it next turn if I take WHITE, GREEN, RED now. Also, taking these colors aligns with N9: I'll have BLUE, GREEN, RED tokens and bonuses eventually. So I'll take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. I have 1 token currently, taking 3 will give me 4 total, well under 10, so no need to return any. Let's verify: current tokens: BLUE=1. After taking: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 added, total = 4 tokens. Good.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 4, holding R1 (total 1 token), bonuses RED:1, score:0. No Level 1 cards affordable: L1_36 effective cost W1 Bk3 (missing all), L1_4 eff G1 R2 Bk1 (R1<2), L1_2 W1 B2 G1 (missing), L1_6 W2 G2 (missing). Higher levels impossible. Purchasing/reserving not viable yet; tokening accelerates engine build. Optimal TAKE_TOKENS: 3 different colors - WHITE1 (key for L1_36, L1_2, L1_6, L2_42, L3_85/82), BLACK1 (heavy demand L1_36/4/2/6? L1_6 no, but L2_46/42/56, L3_82; board 4 avail for future doubles), GREEN1 (L1_4/2/6, L2_42/63, L3_85/88/89, N9). All board avail (W3,G3,Bk4). Post-move: W1 G1 R1 Bk1 (total4). Positions for next buy L1_36 (take 2 Bk if avail or more singles) or L1_4 (need R1 more +Bk1 +G1 have). RED bonus synergizes with L1_36 R1 cost. Opponent (tokens W1 B1 G1 R1, BLUE1 bonus) can't buy L1s easily (lacks Bk heavy), likely tokens too. No token limit/returns needed. Efficient early ramp.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 and a BLUE bonus. Card L1_2 costs WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1. With my BLUE bonus, effective cost is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1, which matches my tokens exactly. Purchasing L1_2 gives me a BLACK bonus (my second bonus) and reduces my token count to 0, allowing me to freely collect tokens next turn. It also removes a card from the board, potentially revealing a new card that could be beneficial. Alternative actions like taking tokens would delay building my engine, and I cannot take two of the same color due to low supply. Therefore, purchasing L1_2 is the most efficient move.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 5, holding W1 G1 R1 Bk1 (total 4), bonuses RED:1, score:0. Check purchases: L1_10 cost W1 G1 R2 Bk1; RED bonus reduces R to 1, effective exactly W1 G1 R1 Bk1 - perfect match, pay all tokens, gain BLUE bonus (0pt). Synergizes with RED for nobles N9 (B3 G3 R3, but BLUE helps N1/N9 partially), future cards L3_85/89. L1_36 effective W1 Bk3 (missing Bk2), L1_4 eff G1 R2 Bk1 (missing R1), L1_6 W2 G2 (missing). No higher affordable. Opponent score 0, bonuses BLUE1 BLACK1, no tokens - likely tokens next, but we build bonuses fast. Taking tokens adds 3 but delays engine (post-buy: 0 tokens, but two bonuses for efficient future buys). Reserving suboptimal with exact buy available. Prioritize purchase for bonus engine over tokens.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 0 tokens and need to build towards purchasing a card that provides a RED bonus for noble N9. L1_36 gives a RED bonus and costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. With my BLACK bonus of 1, the effective cost is BLACK2, WHITE1, RED1. To efficiently gather the required BLACK tokens, I will take 2 BLACK tokens now using the 'take 2 of the same color' action, since the board has 4 BLACK tokens available. This sets me up to collect WHITE and RED tokens next turn, allowing me to purchase L1_36 soon. Taking tokens now is more urgent than reserving, and this move maximizes progress toward both the card and the noble.

Reasoning: Turn 6, holding 0 tokens, bonuses BLUE:1 RED:1, score:0. No cards affordable (L1_1 effective W1 G1 after bonuses cover BLUE/RED; others require more). Opponent holds BLACK:2, bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:0; unlikely to buy L1s immediately (e.g., L1_36 effective W1 R1 Bk2 for them, but no W/R tokens). Must TAKE_TOKENS (cannot reserve/purchase). Optimal: 3 different colors WHITE1 GREEN1 BLACK1 (all board avail: W4 G4 Bk2). Post-move: tokens W1 G1 Bk1 (total 3). Positions perfectly for next turn PURCHASE L1_1 (cost W1 BLUE1 G1 R1; bonuses reduce BLUE0 RED0, pay exactly W1 G1, leftover Bk1, gain BLACK bonus). BLACK bonus valuable for heavy BLACK costs (L1_36/4/6, L2_46/56/42, L3_82). WHITE/GREEN frequent. Avoids 2-same (e.g., 2 WHITE suboptimal, fewer tokens). No token limit/returns. Races opponent to bonuses; L1_1 quick 0pt BLACK engine piece.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 BLACK tokens, aiming to purchase L1_36 which costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. With my BLACK bonus of 1, effective cost is BLACK2, WHITE1, RED1. I already have BLACK2, so I need WHITE1 and RED1. The board has WHITE:3, RED:4, so I can take WHITE and RED. However, I must take exactly 3 tokens of different colors or 2 of the same color. Taking 2 of the same color is possible for RED (since RED has 4 tokens available), but I also need WHITE. I could take 2 RED tokens, but then I'd still need WHITE. Alternatively, take WHITE, RED, and a third different color. My current token count is 2, taking 3 would give me 5 total, under 10, so no need to return. Taking WHITE, RED, and another color (e.g., BLUE or GREEN) would align with noble N9 (needs BLUE, GREEN, RED bonuses). I have BLUE bonus=1, BLACK bonus=1. To progress toward N9, I need GREEN and RED bonuses. L1_36 gives RED bonus, which is perfect. After acquiring WHITE and RED tokens, I can purchase L1_36 next turn. So I should take WHITE and RED now. Since I must take 3 different colors if not taking 2 of same, I'll take WHITE, RED, and BLUE (to start building for future BLUE needs or other cards). That gives me tokens: BLACK=2, WHITE=1, RED=1, BLUE=1. Then next turn I can buy L1_36 using BLACK2, WHITE1, RED1, spending all tokens and gaining RED bonus. That would leave me with BLUE=1 token and bonuses: BLUE=1, BLACK=1, RED=1, making progress toward N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I still need GREEN bonuses. So taking BLUE now is fine. Alternatively, I could take GREEN instead of BLUE to start collecting GREEN, but I don't have an immediate use. BLUE might be useful for future cards. I'll take WHITE, RED, BLUE.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 7, holding W1 G1 Bk1 (total 3), bonuses BLUE:1 RED:1, score:0. As planned from previous turn, exactly positioned to PURCHASE L1_1 (cost W1 B1 G1 R1; BLUE bonus covers B1 to 0, RED bonus covers R1 to 0, effective cost W1 G1 - perfect match, pay W1 G1, leftover Bk1, gain BLACK bonus 0pt). BLACK bonus critical for engine: enables/reduces heavy BLACK costs on L1_36 (eff W1 Bk2 post-buy), L1_4 (eff G1 R2 after RED), L2_46/42/56, L3_82; synergizes with existing bonuses for nobles N5 (R4 Bk4, RED+BLACK help). Other L1s not affordable: L1_36 eff W1 Bk3->W1 Bk2 (Bk1<2), L1_4 eff G1 R2 Bk1 (no R), L1_6 W2 G2 (missing). Higher impossible. Opponent (W1 B1 R1 Bk2, bonuses BLUE1 BLACK1, score0) might buy L1_36 (their eff W1 R1 Bk2 after BLACK bonus, they have all) or L1_4 (eff G0? Wait their no G, but anyway) - buying L1_1 denies them BLACK bonus duplication and races engine. Taking tokens suboptimal (delays bonus acquisition, they might buy points/BONUS meanwhile). Reserving unnecessary with exact buy. Post-buy: Bk1 tokens, BLUE1 RED1 BLACK1 bonuses - strong for next token to L1_36 (take 2 Bk if avail +W? Board Bk1 now, but post-our buy Bk0? Wait board Bk1, we take none. Anyway). Prioritize engine build.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 and bonuses: BLUE=1, BLACK=1. Card L1_36 costs WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=3. With my BLACK bonus of 1, the effective cost is BLACK=2, WHITE=1, RED=1, which matches my tokens exactly. Purchasing L1_36 gives me a RED bonus (my third bonus) and reduces my token count by 4, leaving me with only BLUE=1 token. This aligns with my strategy to pursue noble N9 (requires BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3), as I will then have BLUE=1, BLACK=1, RED=2 bonuses (actually, after purchase, bonuses: BLUE=1, BLACK=1, RED=1, because L1_36 gives RED bonus; I had RED=1 from previous? Wait, I have no RED bonus yet. My purchased cards: L1_11 gives BLUE, L1_2 gives BLACK. So my current bonuses are BLUE=1, BLACK=1. After purchasing L1_36, I'll have BLUE=1, BLACK=1, RED=1, which is progress toward N9. I still need GREEN bonuses. Purchasing now is efficient because I can afford it immediately without needing to take more tokens, and it frees up token capacity. Alternative actions: Taking tokens would be wasteful since I'm at 5 tokens and can purchase. Reserving a card is unnecessary as I have a good target. Therefore, purchase L1_36.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 8, holding Bk1 (total 1), bonuses BLUE1 RED1 BLACK1, score:0. No Level 1 cards affordable: L1_4 eff G1 R2 (missing G/R), L1_6 W2 G2 (missing), L1_33 eff W1 G1 (missing), L1_21 eff R1 (missing R). Higher levels impossible. Opponent similar position (B1 token, same bonuses BRB, score0). Cannot purchase/reserve optimally yet; must TAKE_TOKENS to ramp. Optimal: 3 different colors WHITE1 GREEN1 RED1 (all board avail W4 G4 R4 >=1). Post-move: W1 G1 R1 Bk1 (total4). Positions perfectly for next PURCHASE L1_33 (cost W1 B1 G1 Bk1; BRB bonuses cover B0 R0? Wait B1-1=0 Bk1-1=0, eff W1 G1 - pay exactly W1 G1, leftover R1 Bk1, gain RED bonus → RED:2). Extra RED bonus accelerates L1_4 (eff G1 R1 post RED2), L1_21 (eff R0 impossible but anyway), L3_88/89, N5/N9. Alternatively enables L1_21 immediately after if pivot. WHITE/GREEN key for L1_6/33/4, L2_42/63, L3_85/88/89/82. Races opponent to bonuses/points; they can't buy these now (no W/G/R). Cannot take 2-same on Bk (board3<4). No returns needed (1+3=4<=10). Efficient engine/point ramp.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 1 BLUE token after purchasing L1_36 last turn. My bonuses are BLUE=1, BLACK=1, RED=1. I need to build towards noble N9, which requires BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3. I have no GREEN bonuses yet, so my next goal should be to acquire GREEN bonuses. Looking at face-up cards, affordable options for GREEN bonuses are limited: L1_4 gives BLACK bonus (not needed), L1_6 gives BLACK bonus (not needed), L1_33 gives RED bonus (already have), L1_21 gives WHITE bonus (not needed). None give GREEN. However, there are level 2 cards with GREEN bonuses: L2_63 gives GREEN bonus but costs GREEN=5, too expensive now. L2_42 gives BLACK bonus. Level 3 cards are out of reach. I may need to reserve a card with a GREEN bonus from the deck, or wait for new face-up cards. Alternatively, I could collect tokens to purchase a card that gives a GREEN bonus when it appears. My current token count is 1, so I can take up to 9 more tokens without returning. I should take tokens that help me purchase any affordable card now to build engine and free up capacity. Checking affordable cards: L1_21 costs RED=2, BLACK=1. With my bonuses (RED=1, BLACK=1), effective cost: RED=1, BLACK=0. I have tokens: BLUE=1, need RED=1, BLACK=0. I can take RED token now. But I must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of same. RED has 3 tokens on board, so I could take 2 RED tokens if I want (since 4+ required for 2 of same? Wait, rule says 2 of same only if 4+ available on board. RED has 3, so cannot take 2 RED. So I must take 3 different colors. I can take RED, plus two other colors. I could take GREEN and WHITE to start collecting for future. That would give me tokens: BLUE=1, RED=1, GREEN=1, WHITE=1. Then next turn I could purchase L1_21 using RED token and bonuses, spending 1 token and gaining WHITE bonus. That would progress my bonuses, but WHITE is not needed for N9. However, it's still beneficial. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token and draw a potential GREEN bonus card. Since there are no face-up GREEN bonus cards, reserving from LEVEL_1 deck might be good. But I have 0 reserved cards, so reserving is safe. However, reserving uses an action and gives a gold token, which could help with flexibility. But taking tokens now might be more efficient because I can then buy a card next turn. Considering my low token count, taking tokens is fine. I'll take RED, GREEN, and WHITE to gather resources for various cards. That aligns with potential future purchases. So action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_RED=1, take_GREEN=1, take_WHITE=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. I need to work towards noble N9 which requires BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3. I lack GREEN bonuses entirely. My token count is 4, so I can take up to 6 more without returning. I should take tokens that help me purchase a card that gives a GREEN bonus. Looking at face-up cards: no current GREEN bonus cards. However, L1_24 gives WHITE bonus and costs GREEN=4. That's not helpful. L1_21 gives WHITE bonus and costs RED=2, BLACK=1, which I could afford with my bonuses (RED=1, BLACK=1) plus one RED token. But WHITE bonus doesn't help for N9. L2_63 gives GREEN bonus but costs GREEN=5, too expensive. L3_85 gives GREEN but too expensive. So I may need to reserve a GREEN bonus card from deck. But I also need to build tokens for future purchases. Since I can take tokens now, I should collect colors that are versatile and might help me buy a card that appears later. I should also consider that my opponent has bonuses BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 and may be competing for similar cards. I'll take tokens that align with potential future purchases for N9: GREEN is essential, BLUE and RED are also needed. Since I already have tokens in all colors, I can take three different colors to add to my stockpile. I'll take GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK because: GREEN for future GREEN cards, BLUE for N9 requirement, BLACK for flexibility. But I must check board token counts: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. RED only has 2, so I cannot take RED if I take 3 different colors because after taking one RED, there would be 1 left (still legal), but I want to avoid depleting a color too much. However, taking RED is fine. But I also need to consider that taking RED might help me buy L1_21 soon. However, purchasing L1_21 gives WHITE bonus, which is not needed for N9. It's better to focus on colors that directly contribute to N9. I'll take GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK. This gives me tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1. That totals 7 tokens, well under 10. This sets me up to possibly purchase a card that costs multiple GREEN or BLUE in the future. Additionally, I should consider reserving a card to get a gold token and draw a potential GREEN bonus card. But reserving uses an action and I have no reserved cards yet. However, my token count is low, so taking tokens is more efficient. I'll take tokens now.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 10, holding R1 Bk1 (total 2), bonuses BLUE:1 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:0. Check purchases: L1_21 cost R2 Bk1; RED2 covers R2→0, BLACK1 covers Bk1→0, effective cost 0 - FREE purchase! Gain WHITE bonus (0pt), critical for engine: enables/reduces W costs on L1_24 (G4→still G4 but WHITE for future), L2_42 (W3→2 G3 Bk1), L2_56 (R5→3 Bk3→2 W1? WHITE bonus on purchase), L3_85/82 (W3→2/0?), synergizes for nobles N1 (W4 B4). L1_4 eff G1 R1 (R3-2=1, Bk1-1=0; have R1 but no G). L1_6 W2 G2 no. L1_24 G4 no. Higher impossible. Opponent (W1 B2 G2 R1 Bk1 total7, bonuses B1 R1 Bk1, score0) might buy L1_24 (G4 they have G2<4), L1_4 (eff G1 R2 Bk1 after R1 Bk1, have G2 R1 Bk1), or L1_21 (eff R1 Bk0 after bonuses, have R1 Bk1→yes, they could buy it too). Buying L1_21 now denies them WHITE bonus, races engine to points/nobles. Post-buy: same tokens R1 Bk1, bonuses BLUE1 RED2 BLACK1 WHITE1 - strong (e.g., next take W/G +others → L1_4 or L1_24 progress). Taking tokens suboptimal (adds 3 but delays free bonus). Reserving unnecessary with free buy. Prioritize bonus acquisition.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, total 7. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. My goal is noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I lack GREEN bonuses. There are no face-up GREEN bonus cards currently. I need to collect tokens to purchase future GREEN cards or reserve one. Since I have 7 tokens, I can take 3 more without returning. The board token counts: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2. I can take 3 different colors. I should prioritize GREEN and BLUE for N9. Taking GREEN is crucial. I could take GREEN, BLUE, and a third color like WHITE or BLACK. Taking GREEN=1, BLUE=1, and BLACK=1 would give me GREEN=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=2, RED=1, WHITE=1. That sets me up to potentially purchase a GREEN card if one appears. Alternatively, I could reserve a card from LEVEL_1 deck to possibly get a GREEN bonus. However, reserving would give me a gold token (since gold tokens are available: 5) and draw a card, but I have no reserved cards yet. Reserving might be good to secure a GREEN bonus card, but it uses an action and I already have tokens to potentially buy a face-up card soon. However, none of the face-up cards are attractive for my strategy: L1_4 (BLACK bonus, not needed), L1_6 (BLACK), L1_24 (WHITE, costs GREEN4, not helpful), L1_40 (RED, already have RED). Level 2 cards are expensive. So reserving a LEVEL_1 card might yield a GREEN bonus. But reserving blind is risky. Alternatively, I could take tokens to be ready for when a GREEN card appears. Since my token count is 7, taking 3 more brings me to 10, which is fine. I'll take GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK to continue building resources for N9. This also avoids depleting RED which is low. So action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_GREEN=1, take_BLUE=1, take_BLACK=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 11, holding R1 Bk1 (total 2), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:0. No cards affordable: L1_4 eff G1 R1 (after RED2 BLACK1 cover R3-2=1 Bk1-1=0; have R1 Bk1 but no G). L1_6 eff W1 G2 (no). L1_24 G4 (no). L1_40 W3 (no). Higher impossible. Cannot purchase/reserve optimally yet (reserving delays engine while free tokens available). Must TAKE_TOKENS. No 2-same possible (board W3 G1 B1 R2 Bk1 all <4). Take 3 different: WHITE1 GREEN1 BLACK1 (all board >=1: W3→2, G1→0, Bk1→0). Post-move: W1 G1 R1 Bk2 (total5 <=10, no returns). Positions perfectly for next PURCHASE L1_4 (eff G1 R1 - exact pay G1 R1 using new G1 + existing R1, BLACK bonus covers Bk1→0, leftover W1 Bk2, gain BLACK bonus → BLACK:2). BLACK2 accelerates L2_42 (eff W2 G3 Bk1), L2_46 (Bk6→4), L2_56 (R3 Bk2), L3_82 (W2 Bk5), N5 (R4 Bk4 with RED2 BLACK2). WHITE/GREEN leftovers key for L1_24/40/6, L2_42/63, L3_85/88/89. Depletes board G/Bk, denies opponent. Opponent at 10 tokens (W1 B3 G3 R1 Bk2, bonuses B1 R1 Bk1, score0) cannot buy L1s (e.g., L1_4 eff G1 R2 >R1; L1_6 W2 G2 but W1<2; L1_24 G4>3) - likely reserve/waste turn returning. Races to bonuses/points; efficient ramp avoiding waste.

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2, total 10. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. Goal: noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I lack GREEN bonuses. Face-up cards: no GREEN bonus cards. I have 10 tokens, so I cannot take more without returning. I should purchase a card to free up token capacity. Check affordable cards: L1_24 costs GREEN=4, gives WHITE bonus (1 prestige). With my bonuses, I have GREEN bonus=0, so effective cost GREEN=4. I have GREEN tokens=3, need 1 more GREEN. Could use gold if I had any, but I have 0 gold. So not affordable. L1_4 costs GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=1, gives BLACK bonus. My bonuses: RED=1, BLACK=1 -> effective cost: GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=0. I have tokens: GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. Need RED=1 more, not enough. L1_6 costs WHITE=2, GREEN=2, gives BLACK bonus. Bonuses: BLACK=1 (irrelevant) -> effective cost WHITE=2, GREEN=2. I have WHITE=1, GREEN=3, need WHITE=1 more. Not enough. L1_40 costs WHITE=4, gives RED bonus. Bonuses: RED=1 (irrelevant) -> effective cost WHITE=4. I have WHITE=1, not enough. Level 2 cards are too expensive. So I cannot purchase any face-up card currently. I could reserve a card to get a gold token and reduce my token count? Reserving would not reduce my token count; I would still have 10 tokens and gain 1 gold, exceeding limit unless I return one. But if I reserve, I must return a token because gold token counts toward limit. Actually, when reserving, you take a gold token if available. That would give me 11 tokens, so I must return one. That is acceptable. Alternatively, I could take tokens and return some, but that's wasteful. Since I cannot purchase any card, reserving a card might be best to get a gold token and possibly draw a useful card. I have 0 reserved cards, so I can reserve up to 3. I could reserve a face-up card that might be useful for opponent or to deny them, but none are great for me. Alternatively, reserve from deck to possibly get a GREEN bonus card. I'll reserve from LEVEL_1 deck to draw a random level 1 card, hoping for a GREEN bonus. That also gives me a gold token. I must return one token because I will be at 11. I should return a color I have excess of and don't need immediately. I have GREEN=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=2, WHITE=1, RED=1. I need GREEN for future, so keep GREEN. BLUE also needed. BLACK is less critical. I can return BLACK=1. So action: RESERVE_CARD with deck_level='LEVEL_1', return_BLACK=1. But careful: The action fields for returning tokens are only used when taking tokens? Actually, the return fields are used when taking tokens causes you to exceed 10. For reserving, if you take a gold token and exceed 10, you must also return tokens. The instructions say: 'If total tokens would exceed 10, set return_* fields for tokens to discard.' This applies to any action that increases token count. So I need to set return_BLACK=1. Also, I must set take_* fields? No, for RESERVE_CARD, I don't set take_ fields. But the gold token is automatically taken. So in the response, I should set return_BLACK=1. However, the instructions might expect return fields only for TAKE_TOKENS. To be safe, I'll specify return_BLACK=1 in the JSON. Alternatively, I could purchase a reserved card? I have no reserved cards. Another option: take tokens and return tokens, but that's a wasted turn. Better to reserve. I'll reserve from LEVEL_1 deck.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn={BLACK=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I need to take tokens. My token count is WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, total 10. I must return tokens if I take more, so I should not take tokens unless I can purchase a card. But I have 10 tokens, so I cannot take more without returning. Instead, I should purchase a card to free up token capacity. Let's check affordable cards. My bonuses: BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. Face-up cards: L1_4 costs GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1. With bonuses, effective cost: GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:0. I have tokens: GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2. I need RED:2 but only have RED:1, so can't afford. L1_6 costs WHITE:2, GREEN:2. With bonuses (none for WHITE/GREEN), effective same. I have WHITE:1, GREEN:3 -> need WHITE:1 more. Not affordable. L1_24 costs GREEN:4. I have GREEN:3, need GREEN:1 more. Not affordable. L1_40 costs WHITE:4. I have WHITE:1, need WHITE:3 more. Not affordable. Level 2 cards are too expensive. I have no reserved cards. Since I cannot purchase any face-up card, I must either reserve a card or take tokens and return some. Reserving a card gives a gold token and draws a card, but I have 10 tokens, so taking a gold would exceed limit? Actually, when reserving, you can take a gold token only if available, but if you have 10 tokens, you cannot take any token. Rule says: when reserving, you may take one gold token if available. But if you already have 10 tokens, you cannot take it. However, you can still reserve without taking gold. That might be acceptable. But reserving a card doesn't require taking gold. I could reserve a card from the board to get a potential useful card and not increase token count. That seems better than taking tokens and returning. My goal is to get a GREEN bonus card. The face-up cards have no GREEN bonus. I could reserve L1_24 (WHITE bonus) or L1_40 (RED bonus) but they don't help my noble. Alternatively, reserve from LEVEL_1 deck blindly to possibly get a GREEN bonus. That's a gamble. But I have no reserved cards, so reserving is fine. However, I should consider purchasing a card to free up tokens. I have 10 tokens, so I need to spend some. I could purchase L1_6 if I had one more WHITE token. But I can't take tokens without returning. Alternatively, I could take 2 tokens of same color if available and return 2 tokens. But that's inefficient. Better to reserve a card and not take gold. That keeps token count same. But then next turn I'll still have 10 tokens and unable to take tokens. I need to purchase something. Perhaps I can purchase L1_6 by using gold tokens? I have no gold tokens. I could reserve a card and take a gold token, but that would exceed 10 unless I return tokens. Since I have 10 tokens, I cannot take any token without returning. The rule for reserving: you may take one gold token if available. If you take it, you must obey token limit. So I can reserve without taking gold. That's allowed. I'll reserve a card from LEVEL_1 deck to draw a potential GREEN bonus and not take gold. This action doesn't change my token count, so I can then next turn try to purchase if I draw something affordable or if new face-up cards appear. Alternatively, I could take 3 tokens and return 3 tokens, but that wastes a turn. Reserving is better. I'll reserve from LEVEL_1 deck.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state. My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2, total 10. I am at the token limit of 10! This is critical: I cannot take any tokens without returning some. The error from previous turn likely was because I tried to take tokens while already at 10? Wait, the error says 'Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.' That suggests I didn't set token fields correctly. But in previous reasoning I said take GREEN=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1, but board shows GREEN=0, BLACK=0. So those colors are unavailable. That's the real problem: I tried to take tokens that are not available on the board. Looking at board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=5. So GREEN and BLACK have 0 tokens, cannot take them. My previous action was invalid because I attempted to take GREEN, BLUE, BLACK, but GREEN and BLACK were unavailable. So I must choose different colors. Since I have 10 tokens, taking tokens would require returning tokens. However, I should instead purchase a card to reduce my token count. Let's see what I can purchase. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. I have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. Face-up cards: L1_4 (BLACK bonus, cost GREEN1, RED3, BLACK1). Effective cost with bonuses: GREEN1, RED2, BLACK0 (since BLACK bonus 1). I have GREEN=3, RED=1, so need RED1 more. Could purchase if I had one more RED token or use gold, but I have no gold. L1_6 (BLACK bonus, cost WHITE2, GREEN2). Effective: WHITE2, GREEN2 (no relevant bonuses). I have WHITE1, GREEN3, need WHITE1. Could use gold if I had gold, but I don't. L1_24 (WHITE bonus, cost GREEN4). Effective: GREEN4. I have GREEN3, need GREEN1. L1_40 (RED bonus, cost WHITE4). Effective: WHITE4. I have WHITE1, need WHITE3. Level 2 cards: L2_46 (BLACK bonus, cost BLACK6). Effective: BLACK5 (since BLACK1). I have BLACK2, need BLACK3. L2_56 (WHITE bonus, cost RED5, BLACK3). Effective: RED5, BLACK2 (since BLACK1). I have RED1, BLACK2, need RED4. L2_42 (BLACK bonus, cost WHITE3, GREEN3, BLACK2). Effective: WHITE3, GREEN3, BLACK1. I have WHITE1, GREEN3, BLACK2, need WHITE2. L2_63 (GREEN bonus, cost GREEN5). Effective: GREEN5. I have GREEN3, need GREEN2. Level 3 cards are too expensive. So none are directly affordable. But I could use gold tokens if I had any. I have 0 gold. So I cannot purchase any face-up card right now. I could reserve a card to get a gold token. Reserving a card gives me 1 gold if available, and there are 5 gold. That would allow me to take a gold token and then I could use it to substitute for missing colors. However, reserving uses an action and I would have to return tokens because I'm at 10. Wait, when you reserve a card, you take 1 gold token (if available). That would put me at 11 tokens, so I must return 1 token. That's acceptable. But I also need to consider that reserving might get me a useful card. Since I need GREEN bonuses, reserving from LEVEL_1 deck might be good. Alternatively, I could take tokens but return some. Since I'm at 10, I could take 3 tokens of different colors, but I must return 3 tokens to stay at 10. That's inefficient, but maybe necessary if I can't purchase. However, taking tokens requires the colors to be available. Available: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=2. GREEN and BLACK are 0. So I can only take from WHITE, BLUE, RED. I could take WHITE, BLUE, RED (1 each). That would give me +3 tokens, so I must return 3 tokens. I could return colors I have excess of: BLUE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2. Returning BLUE, GREEN, BLACK would be okay. But taking tokens just to return them is wasteful. Better to reserve a card to get a gold token and return 1 token, then next turn I could use gold to purchase something. Also, reserving might give me a GREEN bonus card. I'll check my reserved cards: I have 0 reserved, so I can reserve up to 3. Reserving a visible card: L1_24 (WHITE bonus, GREEN4) or L1_40 (RED bonus) or L1_4 (BLACK) etc. None give GREEN. So better to reserve blind from LEVEL_1 deck hoping for a GREEN bonus. That also gives me a gold token. So action: RESERVE_CARD with deck_level="LEVEL_1". I'll also need to return 1 token because taking gold will put me at 11. I have to return a token color. I'll return GREEN because I have 3 GREEN tokens and might not need them immediately. But I need GREEN for future purchases. Alternatively, return BLUE because I have 3 BLUE. But BLUE is needed for N9. I'll return GREEN=1. So in the response, I need to set return_GREEN=1. The response format includes return fields. For RESERVE_CARD, I should set card_id="" and deck_level="LEVEL_1". Also set action_type="RESERVE_CARD". I must also set take fields? No, for reserve, we only take gold token automatically, we don't specify take fields. The engine handles that. But we may need to specify return tokens. In the JSON, we have return_WHITE, etc. So I'll set return_GREEN=1. Also, I should confirm that gold tokens are available: yes, 5. So this is legal. Let's verify: I have 10 tokens, after reserve I receive 1 gold, total 11, then I return 1 GREEN, leaving me with 10 tokens including 1 gold. That's fine. This action is efficient: I get a gold token for flexibility, draw a new card that might be useful, and free up a token slot slightly. Next turn, with gold, I might afford a card. Alternatively, I could purchase a card using gold now, but I can't because I have no gold yet. So I'll reserve.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Turn 12, holding W1 G1 R1 Bk2 (total 5), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:0. As planned from turn 11, exactly positioned to PURCHASE L1_4 (cost G1 R3 Bk1; RED2 covers R3→R1, BLACK1 covers Bk1→0, effective G1 R1 - perfect match, pay G1 R1 using held G1 R1, leftover W1 Bk2, gain BLACK bonus → BLACK:2 total). BLACK2 critical for engine: accelerates L2_42 (eff W2 G3 Bk0 after W1 Bk2), L2_46 (Bk6→4), L2_56 (R3 Bk1 after RED2 Bk2), L3_82 (W2 Bk5), nobles N5 (R4→R2 Bk4→2 with RED2 Bk2). WHITE/G leftovers position for L1_24 (G4, next tokens), L1_6/40, L2_42/63, L3_85/88/89. Other L1s not affordable: L1_6 eff W1 G2 (G1<2), L1_24 G4 (no), L1_40 W3 (W1<3). Higher impossible (e.g. L2_42 W2 G3 Bk0 but no G3). Opponent (W1 B3 G3 R1 Bk2 total10, bonuses B1 R1 Bk1, score0) at token cap, likely couldn't act effectively last turn (no buys per prev). Buying L1_4 denies them BLACK2 duplication/progress toward L2s/N5, races to points/engine. Taking tokens suboptimal (delays key bonus while board G0 Bk0 limits options anyway; W2 B1 R2 avail but not urgent). Reserving unnecessary with exact buy. Post-buy: W1 Bk2 tokens (total3), bonuses W1 B1 R2 Bk2 - primed for L2_42 (take 2W +2G? or 3diff incl G if regen) or points. Efficient bonus ramp to mid-game points.

Reasoning: Turn 12, holding W1 G1 R1 Bk2 (total 5), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:0. As planned from turn 11 after taking W1 G1 Bk1, exactly positioned to PURCHASE L1_4 (cost G1 R3 Bk1; RED2 covers R3→R1, BLACK1 covers Bk1→0, effective G1 R1 - perfect match, pay G1 R1, leftover W1 Bk2, gain BLACK bonus → BLACK:2). BLACK2 critical for engine: accelerates L2_42 (eff W2 G3 Bk1 after bonuses), L2_46 (Bk6→4), L2_56 (R3 Bk2 after RED2 Bk2), L3_82 (W2 Bk5→3), N5 (R4→2 Bk4→2 closer). Other L1s: L1_6 eff W1 G2 (G1<2 no), L1_24 G4 (no), L1_40 W3 (W1<3 no). Higher impossible. Opponent (W1 B3 G3 R1 Bk2 total10, bonuses B1 R1 Bk1 score0) cannot buy L1_4 (eff G1 R2 after R1 Bk1, R1<2 no), nor L1_24 (G4=3? G3<4), L1_6 W2 G2 (W1<2), so stuck returning or reserving. Buying L1_4 denies them BLACK bonus if they target later, races engine to points/nobles. Taking tokens suboptimal (board G0 Bk0, only W2 B1 R2 avail for 3 diff or 2W/R; delays bonus). Reserving unnecessary. Post-buy: W1 Bk2 (total3), bonuses W1 B1 R2 Bk2 - strong setup (e.g., next take 3 diff B/W/R + gold? → progress L1_24/40, L2_42). Previous invalid action corrected: now pure PURCHASE. Efficient bonus ramp.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2). My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. I need GREEN bonuses for noble N9. No face-up GREEN bonus cards available. I cannot take tokens because I'm at 10 tokens, and taking would require returning tokens, which is inefficient. Purchasing any affordable card would be better. Check affordable cards: L1_6 costs WHITE2, GREEN2. My bonuses: none for WHITE or GREEN, effective cost same. I have tokens: WHITE1, GREEN3, so need WHITE1 more, but I have no WHITE bonus. Could use gold if I had, but I don't. Not affordable. L1_24 costs GREEN4, gives WHITE bonus. I have GREEN3, need GREEN1 more, but no GREEN bonus, not affordable. L1_40 costs WHITE4, gives RED bonus. I have WHITE1, need WHITE3 more, not affordable. L1_8 costs BLUE4, gives BLACK bonus. I have BLUE3, need BLUE1 more, but I have BLUE bonus=1, so effective cost BLUE3? Actually, cost BLUE4, bonus BLUE1 reduces to BLUE3, I have BLUE3 tokens exactly. But wait, I have BLUE3 tokens, and BLUE bonus of 1 reduces the required BLUE tokens to 3. So I can afford L1_8! That gives BLACK bonus, which is not directly needed for N9, but it adds to my bonuses and gives 1 prestige point. Purchasing it would spend 3 BLUE tokens, reducing my token count to 7, freeing up capacity. However, I really need GREEN bonuses. But buying L1_8 is efficient because it uses my BLUE tokens, gives a point, and frees tokens. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token and draw a potential GREEN bonus card. Since I have 0 reserved cards, reserving is good. But if I reserve, I will take a gold token, but I'm at 10 tokens, so I must return a token to stay at 10. The rules say: when reserving, you receive 1 gold token if available. But if that would exceed 10 tokens, you must return tokens. So I could reserve and return a token. However, reserving a card from deck might give me a GREEN bonus card, but it's blind. Alternatively, I could reserve a face-up card that might be useful? The face-up cards are not great for me. L1_6 gives BLACK, L1_24 gives WHITE, L1_40 gives RED, L1_8 gives BLACK. None give GREEN. So reserving from deck might be better. However, buying L1_8 is immediately beneficial: it gives 1 point, a BLACK bonus (bringing BLACK to 2), and reduces my token count. That could help me later. Also, having more BLACK bonuses might help with other cards. But my primary goal is N9, which needs GREEN. I still need to acquire GREEN bonuses. After buying L1_8, I'll have tokens: WHITE1, GREEN3, RED1, BLACK2 (since BLUE spent). That's 7 tokens, and I can then take more tokens to aim for a GREEN card. But there is no GREEN card face-up. Alternatively, I could reserve a LEVEL_2 card? But that's more expensive. Considering efficiency, buying L1_8 now is a solid move: it scores a point, adds a bonus, and frees token space. It's better than reserving because reserving uses an action without immediate benefit (except gold). Since I have no reserved cards, reserving is not bad, but I think purchasing is better. I'll purchase L1_8.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=null, deckLevel=LEVEL_1, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: I am at the token limit of 10 (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2). Taking tokens would require returning tokens, wasting the turn. Purchasing a card reduces token count and advances my position. The only affordable face-up card is L1_8 (cost BLUE4), which with my BLUE bonus of 1 reduces to BLUE3. I have exactly BLUE3 tokens, so I can purchase it immediately. This gives 1 prestige point, increases my BLACK bonus to 2, and reduces my tokens to 7, freeing capacity for future turns. Reserving a card would require returning a token and does not provide immediate benefits. Therefore, purchasing L1_8 is the best action.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Turn 13, holding W1 Bk2 (total 3), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:2 BLACK:2, score:0. Check affordable cards: L1_13 cost W1 Bk2; WHITE1 covers W1→0, BLACK2 covers Bk2→0, effective cost 0 - FREE purchase! Gain BLUE bonus → BLUE:2. BLUE2 accelerates L3_85 (B6→4), L3_89 (B3→1), nobles N1 (B4→2), N9 (B3→1). Other L1s: L1_6 eff W1 G2 (no G), L1_24 G4 (no), L1_40 W3 (W1<3 no). L2_42 eff W2 G3 (no G), L2_46 Bk4 (no), others impossible. Higher/L3 no. Opponent (W1 G3 R1 Bk2 total7, bonuses B1 R1 Bk2, score1) can also buy L1_13 exactly (W1 Bk2), gaining BLUE2 - must deny them to prevent engine symmetry/upgrade. No nobles met (N5 needs R4 Bk4 bonuses, have 2/2). Taking tokens suboptimal (board W2 B4 G1 R3 Bk0; possible 2 BLUE or 3 diff W/B/G/R but delays free bonus while opponent at 7 tokens might act). Reserving unnecessary. Post-buy: same W1 Bk2 tokens (total3), bonuses W1 B2 R2 Bk2 - stronger engine (e.g., next take B2? No Bk0, but 3 diff B/W/R/G1 → progress L1_24/40 (G/R for points), L2_42, L3_82/85/89, closer N5/N9). Races opponent (their score1 but weaker bonuses), efficient bonus ramp to points/nobles.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2, total 7. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I still lack GREEN bonuses for noble N9. Face-up cards: L1_6 (BLACK bonus, not needed), L1_24 (WHITE bonus, costs GREEN4, I have GREEN3, close but not enough), L1_40 (RED bonus, already have RED), L1_12 (BLUE bonus, costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1). I could purchase L1_12 if I had one BLUE token, but I have BLUE=0. However, with my bonuses: BLUE bonus of 1 reduces cost by 1 BLUE, so effective cost: BLUE0, GREEN3, RED1. I have GREEN=3 and RED=1, so I can purchase L1_12 for free! That gives me an additional BLUE bonus (bringing BLUE to 2) and 0 prestige. Purchasing now would be excellent: it uses my tokens productively, reduces token count by 4 (GREEN3 and RED1), freeing capacity, and advances my BLUE bonus toward N9. This is better than taking tokens because I can buy immediately. I should verify token counts after purchase: I would spend GREEN=3, RED=1, leaving WHITE=1, BLACK=2. That's 3 tokens total, well under 10. Purchasing now is optimal. No other affordable cards give GREEN bonus. After purchasing L1_12, my bonuses become BLUE=2, RED=1, BLACK=2, still need GREEN. But it's progress. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold, but purchasing is better. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id="L1_12".
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 7 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. Bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Goal: noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I need GREEN bonuses. No face-up cards give GREEN bonus. L2_63 gives GREEN but costs GREEN5, too expensive. I could reserve a card to try to get a GREEN bonus, but reserving blind is risky. Alternatively, I can take tokens to prepare for future purchases. I can take 3 different colors without returning. Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=4, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=0. BLACK has 0, cannot take BLACK. So I must choose from WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED. I need GREEN for future GREEN cards, BLUE for N9, RED for N9. GREEN only has 1 token, so I can take GREEN=1. I can take BLUE=1 and RED=1 as well. That gives me tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2, total 10. That's fine. Taking tokens now builds resources for when a GREEN bonus card appears. I could also consider taking 2 BLUE tokens (since BLUE has 4, which is >=4), but that would be 2 of the same color, and I would take only BLUE=2. That might be good because BLUE is needed for N9 and for purchasing other cards. However, taking 2 BLUE would give me BLUE=2, total tokens 9. That's also fine. But taking 3 different colors gives more flexibility. I'll take GREEN, BLUE, and RED because those are the colors for N9. So set take_GREEN=1, take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Turn 14, holding W1 Bk2 (total 3), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:2 RED:2 BLACK:2, score:0. No cards affordable on board: L1_6 eff W1 G2 (no G); L1_24 G4 (no); L1_40 W3 (W1<3); L1_12 eff G3 (no); L2_42 eff W2 G3 Bk0 (W1<2 no G); L2_46 Bk4 (Bk2<4); others higher impossible. No nobles (N5 R4/Bk4 need 4/4 bonuses >2/2; etc.). Board W2 B3 G0 R2 Bk0 Gold5. Opponent at max 10 tokens (W1 B1 G4 R2 Bk2, bonuses B1 R1 Bk2, score1) can buy L1_24 (G4 exact, gain WHITE bonus +1pt → score2 WHITE1) or L1_12 (eff G3 pay G3, gain BLUE →B2). To deny opponent the prestige point and WHITE bonus (helps their L3_82/85 W3→2), RESERVE_CARD L1_24 (visible L1). Removes from board, receive 1 gold (avail), tokens → W1 Bk2 +gold1 (total4 <=10, no return). Secures 1pt WHITE bonus for self later (G4 pay; gold=1G, opponent likely pays G3 for L1_12 → board G3 for me to take).

Alternative TAKE_TOKENS W1 B1 R1 → W2 B1 R1 Bk2 (6), builds toward L1_40 (W3 still short W2<3 next) but allows opp buy L1_24 unhindered (score2). Suboptimal. No blind reserve (visible targeted denial better). Races score/engine, prevents opp upgrade, efficient.

======================================================================================

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. Total = 10. I am at the token limit, so I cannot take tokens without returning some. Returning tokens wastes the turn. Better to purchase a card or reserve to reduce tokens. Checking affordable cards: My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I need to compute effective costs for face-up cards.
- L1_6 (BLACK bonus) cost WHITE2, GREEN2. My bonuses: WHITE0, GREEN0. Tokens: WHITE1, GREEN4. Effective cost: WHITE2, GREEN2. I have WHITE1, GREEN4, so need WHITE1 more, GREEN ok. Not affordable.
- L1_40 (RED bonus) cost WHITE4. My bonuses: WHITE0. Tokens: WHITE1. Need WHITE3 more. Not affordable.
- L1_12 (BLUE bonus) cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. Bonuses: BLUE1, GREEN0, RED1. So effective: BLUE0, GREEN3, RED0. Tokens: BLUE1, GREEN4, RED2. I have enough: BLUE1, GREEN4, RED2. So I can purchase L1_12 spending BLUE1 token, GREEN3 tokens, RED0 tokens. That would cost BLUE1, GREEN3. I have BLUE1, GREEN4. So yes, affordable. This gives BLUE bonus (my BLUE bonus increases to 2) and 0 prestige. It reduces my token count by 4 (BLUE1 + GREEN3) to total 6, freeing capacity. This is good.
- L1_9 (BLUE bonus) cost WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. Bonuses: WHITE0, GREEN0, RED1, BLACK2. Effective: WHITE1, GREEN1, RED0, BLACK0. Tokens: WHITE1, GREEN4, RED2, BLACK2. I have exactly WHITE1, GREEN1, RED0, BLACK0. So I can purchase L1_9 spending WHITE1, GREEN1. That reduces tokens by 2 to total 8. Also gives BLUE bonus.
Both L1_12 and L1_9 are affordable. L1_12 costs more tokens but gives same bonus (BLUE) and 0 prestige. L1_9 is cheaper but also 0 prestige. Which one to choose? L1_12 requires spending GREEN3, which I have plenty. L1_9 requires WHITE1 and GREEN1. Considering my goal for noble N9: I need BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3. My BLUE bonus will become 2 after either purchase. GREEN bonus is still 0. So both don't give GREEN. I need to eventually get GREEN bonuses. But purchasing now frees tokens and builds engine. L1_12 uses more GREEN tokens, which might be useful for later purchasing GREEN cards. However, spending GREEN tokens reduces my stockpile for future GREEN purchases. But I have 4 GREEN tokens, spending 3 leaves 1, still ok. L1_9 uses fewer tokens, leaving more tokens overall but doesn't reduce as much. Since I'm at 10 tokens, I want to reduce significantly to take more tokens next turn. Purchasing L1_12 reduces by 4 tokens, bringing me to 6, which is better. Also, L1_12 has a cost that includes BLUE1, but my bonus covers that, so I spend only BLUE1 token. Actually, effective cost after bonuses: BLUE0, GREEN3, RED0. So I need to spend BLUE1? Wait, I have BLUE1 token, but the cost requires BLUE1? Actually, the card cost is BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. My BLUE bonus is 1, so BLUE cost becomes 0. So I don't need to spend BLUE token. The effective cost is GREEN3 and RED0. I have GREEN4, so I can spend 3 GREEN tokens. That means I spend only GREEN3 tokens. That reduces tokens by 3, not 4. Let's recalc: My tokens: BLUE1, GREEN4, RED2, etc. I need to pay GREEN3. So I spend GREEN3, leaving GREEN1. Total tokens after: WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED2, BLACK2 = 7. Yes, 7 tokens. So reduction of 3 tokens. L1_9: effective cost WHITE1, GREEN1. Spend WHITE1, GREEN1, leaving WHITE0, GREEN3, others unchanged: total tokens 8. So L1_12 reduces more (to 7 vs 8). Both give BLUE bonus. L1_12 costs more GREEN, but I have plenty. So L1_12 is slightly better for reducing tokens. Also, L1_12 might be more contested by opponent? Opponent has BLUE bonus 2, but they have 0 tokens. They might want it too. But I can purchase now. I'll purchase L1_12. That's the best immediate action. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token and draw a card, but reserving would require returning a token because I'm at 10. Not ideal. So purchase L1_12.

Wait, check board token counts: GREEN is 0 on board. That doesn't affect purchasing because I use my own tokens. So fine.

Thus, action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_12.

But let's double-check if any other cards are affordable: L2 cards are too expensive. So yes.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2, total 10. I cannot take any more tokens without returning, which is inefficient. I must either purchase a card or reserve a card to reduce my token count or gain a gold token. I should purchase a card if possible. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Looking at face-up cards, affordable options: L1_6 costs WHITE2, GREEN2. With my bonuses (none for WHITE or GREEN), effective cost: WHITE2, GREEN2. I have tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2, BLUE=1. I need WHITE=2 but have only 1. I could use gold tokens? I have 0 gold tokens. So cannot purchase L1_6. L1_40 costs WHITE4. I have WHITE=1, not enough. L1_12 costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. With bonuses: BLUE bonus 1 reduces BLUE cost to 0, RED bonus 1 reduces RED cost to 0, so effective cost: GREEN3. I have GREEN=4 tokens, so I can purchase L1_12! This gives 0 prestige points but adds a BLUE bonus, bringing my BLUE bonus to 2. That's progress towards noble N9 (needs BLUE3). Purchasing L1_12 reduces my GREEN tokens by 3, leaving me with GREEN=1, total tokens 7, freeing capacity. This is a good move. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token, but purchasing is better as it advances my engine. I should purchase L1_12. However, I need to verify that L1_12 is still available. Yes, it's in face-up cards. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id="L1_12". But wait, my previous reasoning said I would take tokens, but that was invalid because I already had 10 tokens? Actually, the error says my previous action was invalid because I must select tokens to take. That implies I attempted TAKE_TOKENS but did not set token fields correctly. I need to correct that. However, my current token count is 10? Let's double-check: The game state shows my tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. That's 1+1+4+2+2=10. Yes, I have 10 tokens. Therefore, I cannot take tokens without returning, which is wasteful. I should purchase a card instead. So my previous reasoning to take tokens was flawed because I thought I had 7 tokens, but the game state shows 10. That means my last action (purchasing L1_8) reduced my tokens to 7, but then I must have taken tokens? Wait, the history shows I purchased L1_8, then my next reasoning was to take tokens. But the current state shows I have 10 tokens, meaning I must have taken tokens in a previous turn? Actually, the previous turn I purchased L1_8, which reduced tokens to 7. Then I attempted to take tokens, but it was invalid. So my token count remains 7? No, the game state reflects the current state after the invalid action? The error says my previous action was invalid, so the game state is still before that action. That means my token count is still 7, not 10. But the game state shows 10. Let's examine: In the game state, my tokens are listed as WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. That sums to 10. So I must have taken tokens earlier. Actually, looking at the reasoning history, my last reasoning was to take GREEN, BLUE, RED. That action must have been executed and succeeded? But the error says it was invalid. However, the game state might be after that action? The error says my previous action was invalid, so the game state should be before that action. But the game state shows my tokens as 10, which matches what I would have if I took those tokens. I'm confused. To be safe, I'll assume the game state is accurate: I have 10 tokens. Therefore, I should not take tokens. I should purchase a card. L1_12 is affordable and gives a BLUE bonus. That's beneficial. I'll purchase L1_12.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Goal: noble N9 requires BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3. I need GREEN bonuses. No face-up cards give GREEN bonus. Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=4. GREEN and BLACK have 0, so I cannot take those colors. I must take exactly 3 different colors with tokens available. Available colors: WHITE (2), BLUE (3), RED (2). That's three colors, so I can take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1. This would bring my tokens to WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=4, RED=3, BLACK=2 total 13, which exceeds 10, so I must return tokens. I need to return exactly 3 tokens to stay at 10. I can return colors I don't need urgently: WHITE and BLACK are less critical for N9. I can return 2 WHITE and 1 BLACK, for example. But taking tokens while returning is inefficient. I should consider purchasing a card instead to reduce tokens and gain benefits. Affordable cards: L1_9 costs WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. My bonuses: BLUE1, RED1, BLACK2. Effective cost: WHITE1, GREEN1, RED0, BLACK0 (since BLACK bonus covers BLACK). I have tokens: WHITE1, GREEN4, RED2, BLACK2. I can afford it: spend WHITE1, GREEN1. That gives me a BLUE bonus, increasing BLUE bonus to 2, and reduces tokens to 8. That's good. L1_12 costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. Effective cost: BLUE0 (bonus), GREEN3, RED0 (bonus). I have BLUE token 1, GREEN4, RED2. So I can afford it: spend GREEN3. That gives BLUE bonus, increasing BLUE to 2, and reduces tokens to 7. L1_6 costs WHITE2, GREEN2. Effective cost: WHITE2, GREEN2 (no bonuses). I have WHITE1, GREEN4, need 1 more WHITE. Not affordable. L1_40 costs WHITE4. Not affordable. L2 cards are too expensive. Purchasing L1_9 or L1_12 are both affordable and give BLUE bonus, which helps toward N9. Which is better? L1_9 gives BLUE bonus and costs 4 different colors, but I have tokens to cover. L1_12 gives BLUE bonus and costs mainly GREEN. I have plenty GREEN. Both give 0 prestige. L1_12 uses more GREEN tokens, which I have excess. That might be good to reduce token count without wasting. Purchasing L1_12 would spend 3 GREEN tokens, leaving me with GREEN=1, and total tokens 7. That frees capacity for next turns. So purchasing L1_12 is a good move. I'll do that.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 15, holding W1 Bk2 Gold1 (total 4), bonuses W1 B2 R2 Bk2, score 0, reserved L1_24 (1pt W bonus, G4). No purchases possible: reserved L1_24 eff G4 (Gold1=1G, need G3 no); board L1_6 eff W1 G2 (no G); L1_40 eff W3 (W1<3); L1_12 eff G3 (no); L1_9 eff G1 (no); higher no. No nobles. Board W2 B3 G0 R2 Bk0 Gold4. Opponent at 10 tokens (W1 B1 G4 R2 Bk2, bonuses B1 R1 Bk2, score1) can buy L1_12 (eff G3 pay G3, gain B2) or L1_9 (eff W1 G1, gain B2). Either releases G to board (G3 or G1). TAKE_TOKENS only W1 B1 R1 (post W2 B1 R1 Bk2 Gold1 total7), builds but no immediate buy, delays G acquisition (opp buys first, releases G3/G1, then I take incl G1 next but still short for L1_24 G3+G1=4G eff). Better: RESERVE_CARD L1_40 (1pt RED bonus, visible L1, opp can't buy eff W4>1). Get Gold1 (avail4→3), hand W1 Bk2 Gold2 (total5, no return). Secures cheap buy next: after opp buys (say L1_12 pay G3 board G3), take W1 B1 G1 → W2 B1 G1 Bk2 Gold2 (8), then PURCHASE L1_40 eff W3 pay W2+Gold1(as W), left B1 G1 Bk2 Gold1 (5), gain RED3 +1pt (score1 ties). RED3 accelerates L2_56 (R5→2 Bk3→1), L3_89 (R3→0 B3 G6), N5 (R4→1 closer), N9 (R3 exact). Keeps L1_24 for later (Gold1 + future G3). Alternative reserve L1_12/L1_9 denies opp B2 but 0pt for me, no score gain; L1_40 superior (pt + RED3). Races score (me1 opp1), builds engine (RED3 synergizes Bk2 R2 for N5/L2s/L3s), prevents opp pt while securing mine. Efficient transition to points.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Goal: noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I need GREEN bonuses. No face-up GREEN bonus cards except L1_27 (GREEN bonus, cost BLUE1, RED2, BLACK2). With my bonuses, effective cost: BLUE0 (bonus1 covers), RED1 (bonus1 covers, but need token?), BLACK0 (bonus2 covers). I have tokens: BLUE1, GREEN4, RED2, BLACK2. So I need to spend: BLUE1 token (since bonus covers 1, cost is BLUE1, so I need 1 token), RED1 token (cost RED2, bonus1, need 1 token), BLACK0 (bonus2 covers all). I have BLUE1, RED2, so I can afford L1_27 now. Purchasing it gives GREEN bonus, which is exactly what I need for N9. It also costs 0 prestige, but that's fine. This is a great move because it adds a GREEN bonus and reduces my token count from 10 to 8 (spending BLUE1, RED1), freeing up capacity. I should purchase L1_27 immediately. Alternative: I could take tokens, but I'm at 10 tokens, so I'd have to return tokens, which is wasteful. Purchasing is better. Also, I could reserve a card, but that would also require returning a token and doesn't advance my bonuses as directly. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id='L1_27'.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens currently: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. I cannot take more tokens without returning. I need to either purchase a card or reserve a card to reduce token count. I should purchase a card if possible. Check affordable cards: L1_6 (BLACK bonus) costs WHITE2, GREEN2. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. So effective cost: WHITE2, GREEN2 minus bonuses? No bonuses apply. I have tokens: WHITE1, GREEN4. I need WHITE1 more and GREEN2 is covered. I could buy L1_6 if I had one more WHITE token, but I don't. L1_12 (BLUE bonus) costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. Effective: BLUE0 (bonus 1), GREEN3, RED0 (bonus 1). I have tokens: BLUE1, GREEN4, RED2. So I can afford this: need GREEN3 and I have GREEN4. This would cost me GREEN3 tokens and perhaps BLUE1 and RED1? Actually, I apply bonuses first. I have BLUE bonus 1, so BLUE cost reduces by 1 to 0. RED bonus 1, so RED cost reduces by 1 to 0. So remaining cost: GREEN3. I have GREEN4 tokens, so I can purchase L1_12 by spending 3 GREEN tokens. That gives me 0 prestige but adds a BLUE bonus, increasing BLUE bonus to 2. That's good for N9 (needs BLUE3). Also reduces token count to 7 (spend 3 GREEN). That's a productive move. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but that would require returning tokens and not advance my board. Purchasing is better. L1_9 (BLUE bonus) costs WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. Effective: WHITE1 (no bonus), GREEN1, RED0 (bonus1), BLACK0 (bonus2). So need WHITE1, GREEN1. I have WHITE1, GREEN4, so I can afford it. That would give another BLUE bonus. But L1_12 gives same bonus and costs only GREEN3, which is easier. L1_27 (GREEN bonus) costs BLUE1, RED2, BLACK2. Effective: BLUE0 (bonus1), RED1 (bonus1), BLACK0 (bonus2). So need RED1. I have RED2, so I can afford by spending 1 RED token. That gives GREEN bonus, which I desperately need for N9. That's even better! L1_27 gives GREEN bonus, 0 prestige. Purchasing it would cost me 1 RED token (after bonuses), reduce tokens to 9, and give me my first GREEN bonus. That directly progresses toward N9. I should purchase L1_27. But wait, check if I have enough tokens after bonuses: cost BLUE1, RED2, BLACK2. Bonuses: BLUE1, RED1, BLACK2. So I need: BLUE0, RED1, BLACK0. I have RED2 tokens, so I can spend 1 RED token. Yes. So I will purchase L1_27. Action_type: PURCHASE_CARD, card_id: L1_27.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: My previous action was invalid because I did not correctly set token fields. I need to set exactly 3 colors to 1 each. I have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2, total 7. Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=3. I cannot take GREEN or BLACK because they are zero on board. I must take 3 different colors from available ones. Available: WHITE, BLUE, RED. I can take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1. That gives me tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=2, total 10. This builds resources for future purchases. I considered taking 2 BLUE (since BLUE=3 on board, but rule requires 4+ for 2 of same, so I cannot take 2 BLUE). So only option is 3 different colors. I'll take WHITE, BLUE, RED.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Turn 16, holding W1 Bk2 Gold2 (total5), bonuses W1 B2 R2 Bk2, score0, reserved L1_24 (1pt WHITE, G4), L1_40 (1pt RED, W4). As exactly planned from turn 15 after reserving L1_40: now perfectly positioned to PURCHASE L1_40 (cost W4; WHITE1 covers → eff W3; pay W1 + Gold2 as W2 - exact match, leftover Bk2 total2). Gain 1pt (score1 ties opp) + RED bonus → RED:3. RED3 accelerates L2_56 (eff R5-3=2 Bk3-2=1), L3_88 (G7), L3_89 (B3 G6 R3-3=0), closer N5 (R4-3=1 Bk4-2=2 with Bk2 tokens post-buy). Keeps L1_24 reserved (G4 eff; Gold0 now but future G from opp/board). Alternatives: Free PURCHASE L1_27 (cost B1 R2 Bk2 eff 0 after bonuses B2 R2 Bk2 cover → gain GREEN1 0pt) denies opp (they can pay R1 eff), builds toward L1_24 G4→3, L2_42/63/85/88/89/N9 - strong but no pt. L1_6 eff W1 G2 pay W1 Gold2(as G) gain Bk3 0pt inferior. L1_9 eff G1 pay Gold1(as G) gain BLUE3 0pt no. No higher/L2/L3/nobles affordable (e.g. L2_46 Bk4>2; N5 R1 Bk2 need but no action for noble auto). Opponent at 10tokens (W1 B1 G4 R2 Bk2, bonuses B1 R1 Bk2 score1) can buy L1_12 (eff G3 pay G3→board G? avail now0 but they pay), L1_9 (eff W1 G1), L1_27 (eff R1), L1_6? (W2-0 G2 pay W1? G? no W2) gaining BLUE2/GREEN1. But I secure pt+RED3 first, racing score/engine (me1 opp1), post-buy low tokens Bk2 ideal for next TAKE_TOKENS (board W2 B3 G0 R2 Bk0 Gold3 → e.g. W1 B1 R1 +Gold1 → toward L1_24 G or L2_42 etc.). Superior to reserving more/TAKE_TOKENS (no G board, only W/B/R 3diff or 2W/R/B but delays pt while positioned). Efficient score ramp + engine upgrade, prevents lag.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. I am at the token limit, so taking more tokens would require returning tokens, which is inefficient. I should instead purchase a card to reduce my token count and advance my position. My goal is noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I have bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I need GREEN bonuses. Looking at face-up cards, L1_27 gives GREEN bonus and costs BLUE1, RED2, BLACK2. With my bonuses: RED=1 reduces RED cost to 1, BLACK=2 reduces BLACK cost to 0. So effective cost: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=0. I have tokens: BLUE=1, RED=2, so I can afford it exactly. Purchasing L1_27 would give me my first GREEN bonus, progress towards N9, reduce my tokens by 2 (spending BLUE1 and RED1), freeing up capacity. It costs 0 prestige points but provides the needed GREEN bonus. Other affordable cards: L1_9 gives BLUE bonus, costs WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. With bonuses: RED=1 reduces RED to 0, BLACK=2 reduces BLACK to 0, so effective cost: WHITE=1, GREEN=1. I have WHITE=1, GREEN=4, so I can afford it. But BLUE bonus is less critical since I already have BLUE=1 and need BLUE=3 for N9, but GREEN is more urgent. L1_12 gives BLUE bonus, costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. With bonuses: BLUE=1 reduces BLUE to 0, RED=1 reduces RED to 0, so effective cost: GREEN=3. I have GREEN=4, so I can afford it. But again, BLUE bonus less critical. L1_6 gives BLACK bonus, not needed. Level 2 cards are too expensive. So the best purchase is L1_27 to get GREEN bonus. However, I must verify that I have the exact tokens: I need to spend BLUE=1, RED=1. I have BLUE=1, RED=2. So yes. I should purchase L1_27. But wait, I have 10 tokens, purchasing L1_27 will spend 2 tokens, leaving me with 8 tokens, which is fine. I should also consider reserving a card, but that would require returning tokens and not advance my bonuses. Purchasing is clearly better. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id="L1_27".
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2. Total tokens: 10. I am at the token limit, so I cannot take more tokens without returning. Taking tokens would require returning tokens, which is inefficient. I should purchase a card to reduce my token count and advance my position. Looking at face-up cards, I can afford L1_27 (cost BLUE1, RED2, BLACK2) with my bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Effective cost after bonuses: BLUE0, RED1, BLACK0. I have tokens: BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. I can spend RED1 token and have enough. This gives me a GREEN bonus, which I need for noble N9. Purchasing L1_27 is beneficial. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token, but since I'm at 10 tokens, reserving would require returning a token, and I'd still be at 10. Purchasing is better. I'll purchase L1_27.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2). I cannot take more tokens without returning, which is inefficient. I should purchase a card to reduce token count and advance my position. Checking affordable cards: L1_27 gives GREEN bonus, which I need for noble N9. Cost: BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. My bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Effective cost after bonuses: BLUE=0, RED=1, BLACK=0. I have tokens: BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. I can spend 1 RED token (since RED cost is 1 after bonus). I also have enough tokens to cover. Purchasing L1_27 gives me 0 prestige points but adds a GREEN bonus, bringing my GREEN bonus to 1, which is progress toward N9. Also, it reduces my token count by 1 (spend RED token), bringing me to 9 tokens total, freeing capacity for next turn. Other affordable options: L1_12 gives BLUE bonus, cost: BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. After bonuses: BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=0. I have GREEN=4 tokens, so I could spend 3 GREEN, but that would leave me with GREEN=1. That's also possible, but BLUE bonus is less critical than GREEN. L1_9 gives BLUE bonus, cost: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. After bonuses: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=0. I have tokens for WHITE and GREEN. That also reduces token count. But again, BLUE bonus not as needed as GREEN. So L1_27 is best because it gives GREEN bonus. Therefore, action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id="L1_27".
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.. Skipping turn.

Turn 17 - Player 1's move

Reasoning: Turn 17, holding Bk2 (total2), bonuses W1 B2 R3 Bk2, score1, reserved L1_24 (1pt W, G4). Perfectly positioned for FREE PURCHASE L1_27 (cost B1 R2 Bk2 fully covered by B2 R3 Bk2 → eff 0, gain GREEN1 0pt). GREEN1 critical: accelerates reserved L1_24 (G4→3), L2_42 (G3→2 W2 Bk0), L2_63 (G5→4), L3_85 (G3→2 W2 B4), L3_88 (G7→6), L3_89 (B3→1 G6→5 R3→0), N9 (B3→2 G3→2 R3 exact). Denies opponent GREEN1 (they eff R1 pay R2 avail). No other affordable: reserved L1_24 G4 no; board L1_6 eff W1 G2 no; L1_12 eff G3 no; L1_9 eff G1 no; L2_56 eff R2 Bk1 (Bk2 but no R/Gold0); L2_46 Bk4=2 no; higher no; no nobles (N5 R3<4 Bk2<4; N9 B2<3 G0<3). Opponent (10tokens W1 B1 G4 R2 Bk2, bonuses B1 R1 Bk2 score1) can buy L1_27 (eff R1), L1_12 (eff G3 pay G4), L1_9 (eff W1 G1 R0 Bk0? cost W1 G1 R1 Bk1 - B1 covers B? No B cost, wait B0; eff W0 G1 R0 Bk0 pay G1), L1_6 (eff W2-0? W1 G2 pay W1 G2 no G2). But I deny L1_27 first. Post-buy: Bk2 (total2), bonuses W1 B2 G1 R3 Bk2 - superior engine (G1 synergizes R3 B2 Bk2 for L3s/N9/N5 ramp), low tokens perfect for next TAKE_TOKENS (board W3 B3 G0 R2 Bk0 Gold5 → W1 B1 R1 +Gold1(7) toward L1_24 G3eff/Gold-asG + L2_42/56). Taking tokens now (only W1 B1 R1 possible, to 5tokens) suboptimal - misses free denial/upgrade while positioned. Reserving denial inferior (no bonus gain). Efficient engine perfection + denial, transitions to points/nobles race.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=2 (total 10). Bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Goal: noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I need GREEN bonuses, but no face-up cards give GREEN bonus. However, I can purchase L1_12 which gives BLUE bonus and costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. With my bonuses: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost by 1 (so BLUE cost becomes 0), RED bonus reduces RED cost by 1 (so RED cost becomes 0). Effective cost: GREEN3. I have GREEN4 tokens, so I can afford it. Purchasing this card will give me an additional BLUE bonus, bringing my BLUE bonus to 2, which helps towards N9 (needs BLUE3). It also uses 3 GREEN tokens, reducing my token count to 7 (freeing capacity). This is better than taking tokens (which would require returning due to being at 10) or reserving (which doesn't advance my position). Also, purchasing a card gives me progress towards N9. Alternative purchase: L1_9 costs WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. With bonuses: RED1 reduces RED cost to 0, BLACK2 reduces BLACK cost to 0? Actually cost BLACK1, so with BLACK2 bonus it's covered. Effective cost: WHITE1, GREEN1. I have WHITE1, GREEN4, so I can afford it. But L1_9 gives BLUE bonus as well, same as L1_12. L1_9 costs 1 prestige point? No, prestige 0. L1_12 also prestige 0. Both give BLUE bonus. L1_12 uses more GREEN tokens, which I have plenty, and reduces my token count more. L1_9 uses fewer tokens, leaving me at higher token count. Since I'm at 10 tokens, I want to reduce as much as possible to avoid returning later. So L1_12 is better. L1_6 gives BLACK bonus but I don't need more BLACK. L1_14 gives BLUE bonus but costs GREEN2, BLACK2. With bonuses: BLACK2 covers BLACK2, so effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN4, so I could buy it. But it gives BLUE bonus same as others, and uses fewer tokens. However, L1_12 uses 3 tokens, L1_14 uses 2 tokens. I want to reduce tokens significantly, so L1_12 is better. Also, L1_12's cost aligns with my GREEN abundance. Therefore, I will purchase L1_12.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 7 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2) and bonuses BLUE=2, RED=1, BLACK=2. My goal is noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). L1_15 is affordable: cost BLACK3, reduced to BLACK1 by my BLACK2 bonus, and I have BLACK2 tokens to pay. Purchasing it increases my BLUE bonus to 3, meeting the BLUE requirement for N9, reduces my token count to 6 for future flexibility, and advances my strategy. No other face-up cards are affordable or as beneficial. Taking tokens would not progress bonuses, and reserving delays immediate gain.

Reasoning: Turn 19, holding Bk2 (total2), bonuses W1 B3 G1 R3 Bk2, score1, reserved L1_24 (1pt W, G4 eff G3). No purchases affordable: L1_24 eff G3 (no G/Gold); L1_6 eff W1 G1 (no); L1_14 eff G1 Bk0 (no G); L1_5 eff G1 (no); L1_16 eff R1 (no R); L2_56 eff R2 Bk1 (no R); others higher no; no nobles (N9 G1<3; N5 R3<4 Bk2<4; N1 B3<4 W1<4). Opponent (6tokens W1 B1 G1 R2 Bk1, bonuses B3 R1 Bk2 score1) cannot buy now but threatens TAKE_TOKENS incl R1 (board R2>=1) → R3, then PURCHASE L1_16 (eff R3 pay R3, gain 1pt BLUE4 score2). BLUE4 dangerous (symmetric to mine; accelerates their N1 B4 W? R1 N5/N9). To deny pt/BLUE4 and secure for self (eff R1 pay R1 cheap, +1pt BLUE4 closer N1 B4), RESERVE_CARD L1_16 (visible L1). Receive Gold1 (avail5), hand Bk2 Gold1 (total3<=10 no return). Gold joker boosts: L1_24 G3→G2+Gold; L1_6/14/5 G1→Gold; L2_42 W2 G2→Gold+G1 etc.; L3s. Alternative TAKE_TOKENS e.g. R1 G1 W1 → W1 G1 R1 Bk2 (5), allows opp take remaining R1→R3 buy L1_16 unhindered (score2); even if deplete R, they get pt. Suboptimal. No other reserves better (L2_63 G2pt eff G4 future but no immediate threat/denial; L2_56 W pt opp harder). Races score/engine (me pt secured opp denied), prevents opp upgrade, low tokens perfect for next TAKE_TOKENS G-heavy (board G3 post-gold). Efficient targeted denial + self ramp.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens currently (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1). My bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. My goal remains noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I have BLUE3 already, need GREEN3 and RED3 (I only have RED1 bonus). No face-up cards provide GREEN bonus. The only affordable card is L1_5 (cost GREEN2, RED1) which gives BLACK bonus (not needed) and I can afford with my tokens (GREEN1, RED2) but after applying bonuses? Actually cost: GREEN2, RED1. My bonuses: RED1 reduces RED cost to 0, so effective cost: GREEN2. I have only GREEN1 token, cannot afford. L1_14 (cost GREEN2, BLACK2) gives BLUE bonus, but with my BLACK2 bonus, effective cost GREEN2, again I lack GREEN tokens. L1_35 (cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2) gives RED bonus, but after bonuses (BLACK2 covers BLACK2), effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE1, GREEN1, cannot afford. Higher level cards are too expensive. I need to gather tokens to purchase a GREEN bonus card when it appears. Currently at 6 tokens, I can take 3 more without returning. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=1. I should prioritize GREEN and RED for N9. I can take GREEN, RED, and a third color. Taking GREEN=1, RED=1, and BLUE=1 (to have flexibility) would be good. That gives me tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1, total 9. This prepares me to purchase a future GREEN card (like if a GREEN bonus card appears costing GREEN3, I'll need more GREEN tokens). Alternatively, I could take 2 GREEN tokens (since GREEN has 3, but need at least 4 to take 2 of same color? Actually rule: take 2 of same color only if 4+ available on board. GREEN has 3, so cannot take 2 GREEN). So must take 3 different colors. I'll take GREEN, RED, and BLUE because BLUE is also useful for potential purchases. Also note BLACK only has 1 on board, but I could take BLACK=1 instead of BLUE, but I already have BLACK bonus 2 and N9 doesn't require BLACK. So BLUE is fine. I'll avoid WHITE because I have low need. Thus, action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_GREEN=1, take_RED=1, take_BLUE=1.

Reasoning: Turn 20, holding Bk2 Gold1 (total3), bonuses W1 B3 G1 R3 Bk2, score1, reserved L1_24 (1pt W, G4 eff G3), L1_16 (1pt B, R4 eff R1). Perfectly positioned for PURCHASE L1_16 (reserved, eff R1 after R3; pay Gold1 as R - exact, leftover Bk2 total2). Gain 1pt (score2 leads opp1) + BLUE bonus → BLUE:4. BLUE4 elite: completes N9 threat (B3→0 G2→1? Wait G1 need G2 more for exact; but with future), accelerates N1 (B4 exact need W4→3), L3_89 (B3→0 G5→4 R0), L3_85 (B6→2 G2 W2), denies opponent symmetric upgrade/pt (they threatened R3 buy for B4 pt). No better alternatives: other board free-ish like L1_14 eff G1 pay Gold (B bonus redundant 0pt), L1_5 eff G1 pay Gold (Bk redundant), L1_35 eff W1 pay Gold (R redundant); L2_56 eff R2 Bk1 pay Gold(as R) Bk1 (2pt W→2, but uses Bk token need return? No current low; but 2pt >1pt? L2_56 2pt yes, but check if better. L2_56 cost R5 Bk3 eff R2 Bk1 after R3 Bk2; pay Gold(R) + Bk1, yes leftover Bk1 total2, gain 2pt W2 (score3!! W bonus→2). Wait, is this affordable? Tokens Bk2 Gold1 yes. Superior points! But does opp threaten it? Opp eff R5-1=4 Bk3-2=1, they R3 tokens <4, Bk1=1 exact but R short. We secure 2pt W2 first. But reserved L1_16 also 1pt B4 engine. Points priority: 3pt total >2pt. Score to 3 leads big. Engine: W2 accelerates L1_24? No; L3_82 W3→1 Bk7→5; L3_85 W3→1; N1 W4→2. But B4 from L1_16 better for multiples. Wait, compare: PURCHASE L2_56 gains 2pt + W2 (score3, bonuses W2 B3 G1 R3 Bk2), vs L1_16 1pt + B4 (score2, W1 B4 G1 R3 Bk2). Score3 immediate lead huge (opp1, we race to15), W2 solid not critical miss. Can we buy both later? But opp turn next, they at9tokens might buy something (e.g. L1_35 eff W2-0? Opp bonuses B3 R1 Bk2 no W/G; L1_35 W2 G1 Bk2 eff W2 G1 0, pay W1 G2? They W1 G2 yes approx). But points now > engine slight. L2_56 visible, opp can't buy now (R4>3tokens R3? Eff R4 pay R3 +? No Gold? They no Gold, R3<4). Secure 2pt. Reserved L1_16/L1_24 safe. Post-buy low tokens for next. Nobles no. TAKE_TOKENS suboptimal (delays points). Reserve no. L2_56 best: max points ramp (3-1 lead), engine ok, prevents stall. Alternative L1_16 engine for nobles but points first to15 goal.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 9 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1. Bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. Goal: noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I need GREEN3 (currently 0) and RED3 (currently 1). No face-up cards give GREEN bonus. I cannot afford any face-up cards right now because they require GREEN tokens which I lack (e.g., L1_5 costs GREEN2 after bonuses, I have GREEN2 but also need to consider other costs? Actually L1_5: cost GREEN2, RED1; after RED bonus, effective cost GREEN2; I have exactly GREEN2 tokens, but I must also consider that I need to pay with tokens, and I have GREEN2, so I could buy it. However, L1_5 gives BLACK bonus, which is not needed and doesn't help towards N9. Purchasing it would use my GREEN tokens, leaving me unable to buy a future GREEN bonus card. I should prioritize saving GREEN tokens for a GREEN bonus card. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to try to get a GREEN bonus, but reserving blind from LEVEL_1 might not give GREEN. The face-up cards do not have GREEN bonus. I could reserve L2_63 (GREEN bonus, cost GREEN5) but it's expensive and I'd need many GREEN tokens. I have 9 tokens, so I can take one more token without returning. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1. I need more GREEN and RED for N9. I can take GREEN and RED, but RED only has 1 token, so I can take RED=1. I must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of the same if 4+ available. GREEN has 2, so cannot take 2 GREEN. So I need to take 3 different colors. I can take GREEN=1, RED=1, and a third color. Options: WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. WHITE is not needed for N9, BLUE I have plenty bonuses, BLACK not needed. I could take BLACK to have more flexibility, but BLACK only has 1 token on board, so I can take BLACK=1. That would give me BLACK=2, but I don't need BLACK. Alternatively, take BLUE=1 to have more BLUE tokens for potential purchases, but BLUE bonus is already high. I'll take GREEN, RED, and BLUE to keep building towards N9 colors. After taking GREEN=1, RED=1, BLUE=1, I'll have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=1, total 12, which exceeds 10. I must return 2 tokens. I can return WHITE and BLACK, for example. That's acceptable because WHITE and BLACK are less needed. So I'll take GREEN=1, RED=1, BLUE=1, and return WHITE=1, BLACK=1. This gives me a net gain of GREEN and RED, which are crucial for N9. I'll be at 10 tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=0. That sets me up well to purchase a GREEN bonus card when it appears. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_5 now to get a card and reduce tokens, but it doesn't give GREEN bonus. That would be a waste of GREEN tokens. Better to hold GREEN tokens for a future GREEN bonus card. I could also reserve L2_63, but that would require returning a token and I'd get a gold, but I'd still need to gather GREEN tokens later. Taking tokens now is more direct. So I'll take tokens with returns.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Turn 21, holding Bk2 (total2), bonuses W1 B4 G1 R3 Bk2, score2>opp1, reserved L1_24 (1pt W, G4 eff3). No purchases affordable (L1_24 G3 no G/Gold; L1_35 W1 no W; L1_6/14/5 G1 no G; L2_56 R2 Bk1 no R/Gold; others higher; no nobles: N9 G1<3, N1 W1<4 B4=4, N5 R3<4 Bk2<4). Opponent at10tokens (B3 G3 R4, bonuses B3 R1 Bk2 score1) can buy L1_14 (eff G2 pay G2 gain BLUE4) or L1_5 (eff G2 pay G2 gain Bk3), both engine upgrades (0pt). Can't buy L2_56 (eff R4 Bk1 pay R4 Bk1 but Bk0). To race points efficiently: RESERVE L2_56 (2pt W bonus, visible L2), receive Gold1 (avail5), tokens Bk2 Gold1 (total3). Next turn, perfectly positioned to PURCHASE reserved L2_56 (eff R2 Bk1 pay Gold-as-R1 + Bk1 exact, leftover Bk1), gain 2pt (score4 huge lead) + W2 bonus (accelerates L3_82/85 W3→1, N1 W4→2 with B4). Secures key pt card (opp can't reach now), Gold enables exact pay. Alternatives inferior: TAKE_TOKENS W1 B1 G1 (to W1 B1 G1 Bk2 total5) sets up L1_35 buy next (pay W1 gain R4 0pt score2 stagnant); or reserve denial L1_14/5 (get Gold1 but next buy redundant bonus 0pt or L2_56 still possible but misses securing it). Blind reserve risky low pt. No returns needed. Efficient max points ramp (4-1 lead), engine upgrade W2 synergizes B4 R3 for L3s/N1/N5/N9 (G1 close), prevents opp catchup while building to 15.

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=6, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am at 10 tokens, so taking tokens would require returning an equal number, wasting the turn. Purchasing affordable cards (L1_14 or L1_5) does not advance my GREEN or RED bonuses needed for noble N9. Reserving L2_63 secures a GREEN bonus card (2 prestige) that directly contributes to N9's GREEN3 requirement. Getting a gold token helps future purchases, and returning one token minimizes loss. I return BLUE1 as I have surplus BLUE tokens and need to keep GREEN for L2_63. This sets me up to purchase L2_63 soon after gathering one more GREEN token.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 22, holding Bk2 Gold1 (total3), bonuses W1 B4 G1 R3 Bk2, score2>opp1, reserved L1_24 (1pt W, G4 eff G3), L2_56 (2pt W, R5 Bk3 eff R2 Bk1). Perfectly positioned to execute plan: PURCHASE reserved L2_56 (pay Gold1 as R1 + Bk1 exact after bonuses R3 Bk2, leftover Bk1 total1). Gain 2pt (score4 huge 4-1 lead) + WHITE bonus → W2 (elite engine upgrade: accelerates N1 W4→2 B4, L3_82/85 W3→1, L1_24 G3, L3_89 B0 G5 R0 etc.). Secures high-pt card permanently (opp at max10 tokens eff R4 Bk1 for L2_56 but R4 pay R4 no Gold/Bk0 short, can't buy now; reserve would require return but they prioritize engine buy). No better alternatives: other board not affordable without G/W (L1_35 eff W1 pay0 but no W token; L1_14/5/6 eff G1 no G); higher L3/L2 no; no nobles (N9 G1<3; N1 W1<4; N5 R3<4 Bk2<4). Opponent at10tokens (B2 G3 R4 Gold1, bonuses B3 R1 Bk2) can't take tokens/reserve easily (exceed→return wasteful), will likely buy L1_14 (pay G2 gain B4 engine) or L1_5 (pay G2 gain Bk3), 0pt upgrades but can't touch L2_56/L1_24/my nobles path. Post-buy low tokens ideal for next TAKE_TOKENS (board W4 B2 G1 R0 Bk2 Gold3-1=2 → e.g. W1 B1 Bk1 +Gold reserve toward L1_24 G3eff/Gold-asG or L3_89 ramp/N9 with G1 close). TAKE_TOKENS now (e.g. W1 B1 G1 to W1 B1 G1 Bk2 Gold1 total6) delays 2pt/lead, suboptimal. Reserve blind/denial unnecessary (opp engine < points race). Efficient max points acceleration (4-1→race to15), synergizes engine for L3s/N1/N5/N9 (W2 B4 R3 Bk2 G1 perfect), denies opp catchup.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_56]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_56
Reasoning: Turn 22 (post-invalid), holding Bk2 Gold1 (total3), bonuses W1 B4 G1 R3 Bk2 score2>opp1, reserved L1_24(1pt W G4eff3), L2_56(2pt W R5Bk3 eff R2Bk1). No purchases possible: L2_56 eff R2Bk1 (Gold1asR1 short R1Bk1); L1_24 G3 (Gold1asG1 short G2); board L1_14/5 eff G1 (Gold ok but 0pt redundant B/Bk); L1_35 W1 noW; L1_6 W1G1 no; higher/nobles no (N1 W1<4; N9 G1<3; N5 R3<4). Opponent (10tokens B2G3R4Gold1 Bk0, bonuses B3R1Bk2 score1, reserved L2_63 G5eff5) can buy L1_14 (eff G2 pay G2→B4) or L1_5 (G2→Bk3) for engine no pts; can't L2_56/46 (Bk short even w/Gold). Optimal: RESERVE L2_46 (3pt Bk bonus visible L2), receive Gold1→ Bk2 Gold2 (total4). Next turn PURCHASE reserved L2_46 (eff Bk6-Bk2=Bk4 pay Bk2 Gold2(asBk2) exact→ leftover0, gain 3pt Bk3 score5!!). Superior to alt reserve L1_14(deny B4 +Gold2→buy L2_56 next R2Bk1 w/Gold2 score4) or L2_56 already reserved; 3pt>Bk3>2pt W2. Vs TAKE_TOKENS 2W (→W2 total5, next buy L1_35 pay W1→R4 score2, next buy L2_56 Gold R1Bk1→score4 W2): reserve secures 3pt ONE TURN FASTER (my turn24 score5 vs turn26 score4), huge lead (opp max ~engine no pts), Bk3 synergizes N5(R3→need R4 Bk1more), L3_82(W2 Bk4), L2_42 Bk0 etc. Low tokens ideal post-buy.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have tokens: BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, GOLD=1 (total 10). My bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. I have a reserved card L2_63 (cost GREEN5, prestige 2, GREEN bonus). This card directly provides a GREEN bonus (needed for N9) and 2 prestige points, bringing my score to 3. To purchase it, I need to pay GREEN5. My bonuses do not reduce GREEN cost. I have GREEN tokens=3, GOLD token=1 (can substitute for any color). So I can pay: GREEN3 + GOLD1 substitutes for GREEN1 = GREEN4, still need GREEN1 more. I need additional GREEN token? Wait, I can use GOLD as a wildcard, but I only have one GOLD. So total paying power: GREEN3 + GOLD1 (as GREEN) = 4 GREEN. I'm short by 1 GREEN. However, I could also use other tokens? No, the cost is only GREEN, no other colors. So I cannot afford L2_63 yet. I need one more GREEN token. But I cannot take tokens because I'm at 10 tokens; taking would require returning. I could return tokens to free up capacity and take GREEN. Alternatively, I could purchase another affordable card to reduce token count, then take GREEN next turn. Let's examine face-up cards for affordability. L1_5: cost GREEN2, RED1. With bonuses: RED1 reduces RED cost to 0, so effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, so I can afford it. But it gives BLACK bonus (not needed) and 0 prestige. Purchasing it would use 2 GREEN tokens, leaving me with GREEN1 and still not enough for L2_63 (needs GREEN5). L1_14: cost GREEN2, BLACK2. With bonuses: BLACK2 covers BLACK2, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, can afford. But gives BLUE bonus (already have BLUE3). L1_6: cost WHITE2, GREEN2. With bonuses: no WHITE or GREEN bonus, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN2. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, cannot afford (missing WHITE). L1_35: cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2. With bonuses: BLACK2 covers BLACK2, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, cannot afford WHITE. Level 2 cards: L2_62: cost BLUE5, GREEN3. With bonuses: BLUE3 reduces BLUE cost to BLUE2, I have BLUE2 tokens, so BLUE cost covered. GREEN3 cost, I have GREEN3 tokens. So I can afford L2_62! That gives GREEN bonus and 2 prestige. That's even better than L2_63 because it's face-up and I can afford it now. Check: cost BLUE5, GREEN3. My bonuses: BLUE=3, so BLUE cost reduced by 3 => need BLUE2 tokens. I have BLUE2 tokens. GREEN cost reduced by 0 => need GREEN3 tokens. I have GREEN3 tokens. So I can purchase L2_62 without using gold. This gives me GREEN bonus (first one) and 2 prestige, advancing my score to 3 and moving towards N9 (GREEN3 requirement). After purchase, I will spend BLUE2 and GREEN3 tokens, leaving tokens: BLUE0, GREEN0, RED4, GOLD1 (total 5). That frees up capacity. This is a great move. Alternatively, I could purchase L2_63 by using gold and returning tokens? But L2_62 is better because it's affordable now and gives same prestige and GREEN bonus. I should purchase L2_62. Verify card exists: yes, in faceUpCards LEVEL_2. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L2_62.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_63]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_63
Reasoning: I attempted to purchase L2_63 last turn but got an 'Insufficient tokens' error. Let me recalculate. I have tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. My reserved card L2_63 costs GREEN5. Applying bonuses: I have no GREEN bonus, so effective cost is GREEN5. I have GREEN3 tokens and 1 GOLD token. GOLD can substitute for any color, so I can use 1 GOLD to cover 1 GREEN, plus my 3 GREEN tokens, totaling 4 GREEN. I still need 1 more GREEN. Actually, wait: GOLD can be used as any color, so I can use GOLD to cover the missing GREEN. But I need to pay exactly the cost: the card requires 5 GREEN. I have 3 GREEN tokens and 1 GOLD token. GOLD can count as 1 GREEN, so that's 4. I'm still short 1 GREEN. I cannot purchase L2_63 because I lack sufficient tokens. That's why the error occurred. I need to gather more GREEN tokens. Currently, board tokens: GREEN=1 available. I have 10 tokens (WHITE0, BLUE2, GREEN3, RED4, BLACK0, GOLD1) so I cannot take more without returning. I could return some tokens to take GREEN. Alternatively, I could purchase a different card. Let's check affordable cards. I need GREEN and RED bonuses for noble N9. Face-up cards: L1_5 (cost GREEN2, RED1) gives BLACK bonus. After bonuses: RED1 reduces RED cost to 0, so effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford it. But purchasing L1_5 gives BLACK bonus, which I don't need, and uses 2 GREEN tokens, reducing my GREEN tokens to 1, making it harder to later purchase L2_63. However, it reduces my token count from 10 to 8, freeing capacity. L1_14 (cost GREEN2, BLACK2) gives BLUE bonus. After bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK cost to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, so affordable. Again, uses 2 GREEN. L1_6 (cost WHITE2, GREEN2) gives BLACK bonus. After bonuses: no relevant bonuses, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN2. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, so I need WHITE tokens? I have 0 WHITE, but I have GOLD1 which can substitute for WHITE. So I could use GOLD for 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN? Actually cost is WHITE2, GREEN2. I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can pay GREEN2, and I need WHITE2. I have GOLD1 which can cover 1 WHITE, but still need 1 more WHITE. I have no WHITE tokens, so cannot afford. L1_35 (cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2) gives RED bonus. After bonuses: BLACK2 covers BLACK2, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have GREEN1 token, but need WHITE2. I have GOLD1 which can cover 1 WHITE, still need 1 WHITE. Not affordable. Higher level cards: L2_62 (cost BLUE5, GREEN3) gives GREEN bonus. After bonuses: BLUE3 reduces BLUE cost by 3, so BLUE cost becomes 2. I have BLUE2 tokens, so BLUE cost covered. GREEN cost 3, I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford L2_62! That's a GREEN bonus card (2 prestige) and it helps towards N9's GREEN3 requirement. It costs exactly my BLUE and GREEN tokens. Let's verify: Total cost: BLUE5, GREEN3. My bonuses: BLUE3 reduces BLUE cost to 2. I have BLUE2 tokens, so I can pay the BLUE2. I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can pay GREEN3. No need for GOLD. After purchase, I will have tokens: BLUE0, GREEN0, RED4, BLACK0, GOLD1. That reduces my token count to 5 (since I spent 5 tokens). That's good, frees capacity. And I gain a GREEN bonus, bringing my GREEN bonus to 1 (since currently 0). Also 2 prestige points, bringing my total score to 3. This advances me toward N9 (now I have BLUE3, GREEN1, RED1). I still need more GREEN and RED bonuses, but this is progress. Alternatively, I could take tokens to get more GREEN, but I'm at 10 tokens, so I'd have to return tokens. Taking tokens would be inefficient. Purchasing L2_62 is a solid move: it uses my abundant BLUE tokens (which I have high bonus but not needed for N9 beyond BLUE3 already achieved) and my GREEN tokens to get a GREEN bonus. It's affordable now. I should purchase L2_62. But note: L2_62 is a face-up card on the board (LEVEL_2). I must check it's available: yes, in faceUpCards LEVEL_2 list, id L2_62. So I will purchase L2_62.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_63]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_63
Reasoning: I attempted to purchase L2_63 previously but got an error: insufficient tokens. Let me recalculate. My reserved card L2_63 costs GREEN5. My bonuses: I have BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2; GREEN bonus is 0. So cost is 5 GREEN tokens. I have GREEN3 tokens, RED4, BLUE2, BLACK0, WHITE0, GOLD1. I can use the gold token as a wildcard for 1 GREEN. So I can pay: 3 GREEN tokens + 1 gold token = 4 GREEN equivalent, still short 1 GREEN. I need one more GREEN token or another gold. But I have only 1 gold. So I cannot afford L2_63 yet. I need to gather one more GREEN token. However, I am at 10 tokens (including gold), so I cannot take tokens without returning. Alternatively, I could purchase an affordable card to reduce token count and then take tokens next turn. Let's check affordable face-up cards: L1_14 costs GREEN2, BLACK2. After bonuses: BLACK2 bonus reduces BLACK2 cost to 0, so effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford it. Purchasing L1_14 gives BLUE bonus (not needed) but uses 2 GREEN tokens, reducing my token count to 8 (since I spend 2 GREEN, and card gives no tokens). That would free up capacity to take tokens next turn. However, L1_14 gives BLUE bonus which I already have 3, so it's not useful for N9. It does give 0 prestige. But it's better than taking tokens and returning. Alternatively, L1_5 costs GREEN2, RED1. After bonuses: RED1 reduces RED cost to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford it. L1_5 gives BLACK bonus (not needed). It also uses 2 GREEN tokens. L1_35 costs WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2. After bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK2 to 0, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, cannot afford due to WHITE. L1_6 costs WHITE2, GREEN2. No relevant bonuses, so effective cost WHITE2, GREEN2. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, cannot afford. So only L1_14 and L1_5 are affordable. Both are not helpful for my goal (GREEN/RED bonuses). But purchasing any card reduces my token count, allowing me to take more tokens next turn to eventually afford L2_63. I need to get more GREEN tokens. After purchasing L1_14, I'd have tokens: BLUE2, GREEN1, RED4, BLACK0, GOLD1 (total 8). Then next turn I can take 3 tokens (including GREEN) without returning. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token and return a token. But I already have a reserved card I want to buy. I think the best move is to purchase L1_14 to burn tokens and free up capacity, even though it doesn't give useful bonus. It's better than doing nothing. However, I should check if I can purchase L2_63 with my current tokens if I use gold for GREEN and maybe use other tokens? No, L2_63 requires exactly GREEN5, no other colors. So I must have 5 GREEN tokens or gold substitutes. I have 3 GREEN + 1 gold = 4, short 1. So cannot. Therefore, I will purchase L1_14 to reduce token count and prepare for future token collection.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Total tokens: 10. My bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. My goal is noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I already have BLUE3, need GREEN3 (currently 0) and RED3 (currently 1). I have a reserved card L2_63 which gives GREEN bonus and 2 prestige points. Its cost is GREEN5. After applying my bonuses: I have no GREEN bonus, so effective cost is GREEN5. I have GREEN3 tokens and 1 GOLD token. I can use the GOLD token to substitute for 1 GREEN, so I need 4 more GREEN. But I only have 3 GREEN tokens, so I'm short 1 GREEN. However, I can use the GOLD token as any color, so I can cover 1 GREEN with GOLD, and the remaining 4 GREEN must be paid with tokens. I have only 3 GREEN tokens. Therefore, I cannot afford L2_63 yet. I need one more GREEN token. But wait, I can also use other tokens? No, the cost is only GREEN5, so I must pay with GREEN tokens or GOLD. So I need 5 total resources; I have 3 GREEN tokens + 1 GOLD = 4 resources, short 1. So I cannot purchase L2_63 now. I need to acquire one more GREEN token. However, I am at 10 tokens, so I cannot take tokens without returning. But I could take 2 GREEN tokens if available (since board shows GREEN=1, not enough for 2). So I cannot take 2 GREEN. I could take 3 different colors, but that would require returning tokens. That might be acceptable if it gets me the GREEN I need. Board tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=4, GOLD=4. RED has 0, so I cannot take RED. I could take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=1 (or BLUE=1). That would give me 3 more tokens, total 13, requiring return of 3 tokens. I could then have GREEN=4, plus GOLD=1, total 5 resources to buy L2_63. But returning 3 tokens is inefficient. Alternatively, I could purchase a cheaper card to reduce my token count, then take tokens next turn. Let's see affordable cards: L1_5 costs GREEN2, RED1. After bonuses: RED1 reduces RED cost to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford it. But L1_5 gives BLACK bonus, which I don't need. It would use 2 GREEN tokens, leaving me with GREEN1, GOLD1, and total tokens 8. That would allow me to take tokens next turn to get more GREEN. However, L1_5 does not advance my GREEN bonus. L1_14 costs GREEN2, BLACK2. After bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK cost to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I can afford it with GREEN3 tokens. It gives BLUE bonus, but I already have BLUE3. Not helpful. L1_6 costs WHITE2, GREEN2. No bonuses to reduce, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN2. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, GOLD1. I could use GOLD for WHITE, but still need WHITE1 and GREEN2? Actually, I have WHITE0, so I need 2 WHITE. I can use GOLD for one WHITE, but I still need another WHITE. I don't have WHITE tokens, so cannot afford. L1_35 costs WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2. After bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK cost to 0, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, GOLD1. I can use GOLD for one WHITE, but need another WHITE. Not enough. So only L1_5 and L1_14 are affordable. Buying either would use GREEN tokens, which I need for L2_63. But buying L1_5 would use 2 GREEN, leaving me with GREEN1, still short for L2_63. However, if I buy L1_5, I reduce token count to 8, then next turn I can take 3 tokens, including GREEN (if still available). But RED tokens are 0 on board, so I might not be able to take RED. Actually, I can take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLUE=1 (or BLACK=1). That would give me GREEN=2 (after purchase L1_5, I'd have GREEN1, then take GREEN1 -> GREEN2), still not enough for L2_63. I would need to take 2 GREEN in a future turn, but GREEN only has 1 now. So that path is uncertain. Alternatively, I could reserve another card to get a GOLD token, but I already have a reserved card. I can have up to 3 reserved cards. Reserving a card would give me a GOLD token (if available), and I would need to return a token because I'm at 10. That would give me GOLD=2, but I'd still need GREEN tokens. Not great. Another idea: purchase L2_63 using my current tokens plus maybe using GOLD for 2 GREEN? No, GOLD only substitutes one color at a time? Actually, each GOLD token can substitute for one token of any color. So with 1 GOLD, I can cover 1 GREEN. I need 5 GREEN resources; I have 3 GREEN tokens + 1 GOLD = 4, short 1. So I need one more GREEN token. If I take tokens now, I can take GREEN=1, plus two other colors, and return some tokens. Let's calculate: I take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLUE=1 (since RED=0). My tokens become: WHITE=0+1=1, BLUE=2+1=3, GREEN=3+1=4, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Total = 1+3+4+4+0+1 = 13. I must return 3 tokens. I want to keep GREEN high, so I can return RED=3 (since I have RED4) and maybe BLUE=0? Actually, I need to return exactly 3. I could return RED=3, bringing RED down to 1. That would leave me with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=4, RED=1, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Total = 10. Then I can purchase L2_63: cost GREEN5. I have GREEN4 tokens + 1 GOLD = 5 resources. Perfect. So taking tokens with returns allows me to purchase L2_63 immediately next turn. But wait, I can only take tokens if RED is available? RED=0 on board, so I cannot take RED. So I must choose three colors from WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, BLACK. GREEN=1, WHITE=4, BLUE=2, BLACK=4. So I can take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=1. That works. Then I would have: WHITE=0+1=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3+1=4, RED=4, BLACK=0+1=1, GOLD=1. Total = 1+2+4+4+1+1=13. Return 3 tokens. I want to keep GREEN=4, so I can return RED=3 (since I have RED4) and maybe BLUE=1? Actually, I need to return 3 total. I could return RED=3, bringing RED to 1. Then tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=4, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1. Total = 10. Then I have GREEN4 + GOLD1 = 5 resources to buy L2_63. Yes, that works. So taking tokens now with returns sets me up to purchase L2_63 next turn. However, this uses two turns: one to take tokens (with returns), next to purchase. But I could also consider purchasing L2_63 now by using the GOLD and hoping I can cover the missing GREEN with something else? No, I cannot. So the fastest way to get the GREEN bonus is to take tokens now, then purchase next turn. But is there a faster way? What if I purchase L1_5 now? That gives no GREEN bonus, and uses 2 GREEN tokens. Then I'd have GREEN1, GOLD1, and 8 tokens. Next turn, I could take GREEN=1 (if available), WHITE=1, BLACK=1, bringing GREEN to 2, total tokens to 11, return 1 token. Still not enough for L2_63 (need 5, have 2+GOLD=3). So that would delay L2_63 further. So the token-taking plan is better. However, I must consider that taking tokens with returns is inefficient, but it gets me to the purchase in two turns. Alternatively, I could reserve another card to get a second GOLD token? But I would have to return a token, and I'd still need GREEN tokens. Not helpful. So I'll go with taking tokens to set up purchase of L2_63. But wait, I can also consider purchasing a different card that gives GREEN bonus from the face-up cards. There is L2_62 which gives GREEN bonus, cost BLUE5, GREEN3. I have BLUE3 bonus, so effective cost BLUE2, GREEN3. I have BLUE2 tokens, GREEN3 tokens, and GOLD1. I could use GOLD for one BLUE? Actually, I need BLUE2 and GREEN3. I have BLUE2 tokens, GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford it without using GOLD. That gives me a GREEN bonus and 2 prestige points, same as L2_63 but without needing to reserve. And I can purchase it now! Let's verify: L2_62 cost: BLUE5, GREEN3. My bonuses: BLUE3 reduces BLUE cost by 3, so BLUE cost becomes 2. GREEN0, so GREEN cost remains 3. I have BLUE2 tokens, GREEN3 tokens, exactly enough. Total tokens: BLUE2 + GREEN3 = 5 tokens used. I have GOLD1 left, but not needed. After purchase, I would have tokens: WHITE0, BLUE0, GREEN0, RED4, BLACK0, GOLD1. Total tokens: 5. That's fine. I would gain a GREEN bonus, bringing my GREEN bonus to 1, and 2 prestige points, total score 3. Then I would still need 2 more GREEN bonuses for N9, and 2 more RED bonuses. But this is progress. Purchasing L2_62 is better than waiting to buy L2_63 because it's affordable now, gives same prestige, and gives GREEN bonus. Also, it uses my tokens efficiently without needing to return any. And it reduces my token count to 5, allowing me to take more tokens next turn. This seems like the best move. Let's double-check: L2_62 is face-up, card_id L2_62. Yes, in faceUpCards LEVEL_2. So I should purchase L2_62 now. That advances my strategy immediately. After purchase, I will have bonuses: BLUE3, RED1, BLACK2, GREEN1. That's progress toward N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I will also have 3 prestige points. My opponent has 5 points, so I'm catching up. So I'll purchase L2_62.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_63]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_63
Reasoning: I need to correct my previous invalid attempt to purchase L2_63. The error indicates insufficient tokens. Let's examine my current tokens and the cost of L2_63.

My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Total: 10.
L2_63 (in my reserved hand) cost: GREEN:5.
My bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. No GREEN bonus, so cost remains GREEN:5.
I have GREEN tokens: 3. I have 1 GOLD token which can substitute for any one color. So I can use GREEN:3 + GOLD:1 to cover 4 of the 5 GREEN required. I'm still short 1 GREEN. Therefore, I cannot afford L2_63 yet. I need at least 2 more GREEN tokens (or 1 more GREEN and use GOLD, but GOLD already used). Since I have only 1 GOLD, I need more GREEN tokens.

I'm at 10 tokens, so taking tokens requires returning tokens. That's inefficient. I should consider purchasing any affordable card to reduce token count and potentially get a GREEN or RED bonus (needed for N9). Let's check face-up affordable cards:
- L1_14: cost GREEN:2, BLACK:2. My bonuses: BLACK:2 covers BLACK:2, so effective cost GREEN:2. I have GREEN:3, so I can afford. But L1_14 gives BLUE bonus (I already have BLUE=3) and 0 prestige. It would use 2 GREEN tokens, reducing my GREEN stash and not giving needed GREEN bonus. However, it would reduce my token count to 8, freeing capacity. But it doesn't advance my GREEN bonus.
- L1_5: cost GREEN:2, RED:1. My bonuses: RED:1 covers RED:1, so effective cost GREEN:2. I can afford. Gives BLACK bonus (I have BLACK=2), 0 prestige. Same issue.
- L1_35: cost WHITE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:2. Bonuses: BLACK:2 covers BLACK:2, so effective cost WHITE:2, GREEN:1. I have WHITE:0, GREEN:3, so need 2 WHITE tokens. I have 1 GOLD that can substitute for WHITE, but I would still need 1 more WHITE (or use GOLD for both, but only 1 GOLD). So not affordable.
- L1_6: cost WHITE:2, GREEN:2. No bonuses to help, effective cost WHITE:2, GREEN:2. I have WHITE:0, GREEN:3, and 1 GOLD. Use GOLD for 1 WHITE, still need 1 WHITE and 2 GREEN, but I have GREEN:3, but WHITE missing. Not affordable.
Level 2 cards: too expensive.

Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a GOLD token and reduce tokens? But reserving a card would give me 1 GOLD, but I would have to return a token because I'm at 10. That's still a net gain of GOLD, but I would be at 10 tokens again (since I return 1, take 1 GOLD). That might help future purchases, but delays. However, reserving a card with GREEN bonus could be beneficial. The face-up cards have no GREEN bonus. I could reserve blind from LEVEL_2 to potentially get a GREEN bonus card, but uncertain.

Given that I cannot afford L2_63 yet, I need more GREEN tokens. Since taking tokens requires returning, I should purchase an affordable card to reduce token count and maybe get a useful bonus. Among the affordable, L1_14 and L1_5 are similar. I choose L1_5 because it costs RED:1 which is covered by my RED bonus, so I only spend GREEN:2. That leaves me with GREEN:1, plus my GOLD. After purchase, I'll have tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1 (total 8). That reduces my token count and I can then take more tokens next turn to gather GREEN. Also, L1_5 gives BLACK bonus (increasing BLACK to 3), which doesn't help N9 but might help with other cards or nobles? Actually noble N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4, and I have RED:1 bonus, BLACK:2 bonus. After purchasing L1_5, BLACK becomes 3. Not directly relevant. But still, it's a cheap purchase that uses tokens.

Alternatively, I could purchase L1_14, which uses GREEN:2 and BLACK:2 (covered by bonus), so same net effect on GREEN tokens. L1_14 gives BLUE bonus (I already have 3). Neither gives GREEN or RED bonus.

Maybe I should reserve a card to get a GOLD and hope for a GREEN bonus. But reserving blind is risky.

Considering my goal: I need GREEN bonus and RED bonus. I have a reserved L2_63 (GREEN bonus) that I can't afford yet. I need 2 more GREEN tokens. I'm at 10 tokens, so I cannot take more without returning. Purchasing L1_5 or L1_14 would reduce my GREEN tokens from 3 to 1, making it harder to afford L2_63 (needs 5). That seems counterproductive. Maybe I should reserve another card to get a GOLD, and then next turn take tokens (including GREEN) to build up GREEN. But reserving a card would require returning a token (since at 10). I could return a color I don't need, like BLUE or RED? I need RED for N9, so keep RED. I could return BLUE=2, but I only have BLUE=2. If I return BLUE=2, I'll be at 8 tokens, then reserve a card, get GOLD, and be at 9 tokens. That uses my turn to get a GOLD and reduce BLUE. Then next turn I can take tokens, maybe take 2 GREEN if available (GREEN has 1 on board currently, so can't take 2). Board tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=4. I can only take 3 different colors. I could take GREEN=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1, for example. That would give me GREEN+1, BLACK+1, WHITE+1, and I'd be at 12 tokens, need to return 2. Messy.

Better to purchase L1_5 now to reduce token count and free capacity, then next turn take tokens to get GREEN. After purchasing L1_5, I'll have 8 tokens. Then I can take 3 tokens: GREEN (1 available), and two others, maybe WHITE and BLACK, to have flexibility. That would bring me to 11 tokens, need to return 1. That's okay. Then I can eventually afford L2_63 with more GREEN tokens.

I'll go with purchasing L1_5. It's affordable, reduces tokens, and I get a minor bonus.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card null not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. I have one reserved card: L2_63 (GREEN bonus, prestige 2, cost GREEN5). My goal is noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I already have BLUE3, need GREEN3 (currently 0) and RED3 (currently 1). L2_63 gives GREEN bonus, which directly contributes to GREEN3 requirement. It also gives 2 prestige points, increasing my score from 1 to 3. To purchase L2_63, cost is GREEN5. I have GREEN3 tokens and GREEN1 bonus from the card itself? Actually I don't have any GREEN bonus yet, so no reduction. I have 1 gold token which can substitute for any color, so I can use gold for 1 GREEN. That means I need GREEN4 tokens plus gold covers 1, but I only have GREEN3 tokens. Wait: cost is GREEN5. With no GREEN bonus, I need to pay 5 GREEN tokens or use gold. I have GREEN3 tokens and 1 gold, total 4 'green' resources, short by 1. However, I also have other tokens: BLUE2, RED4. But the cost is only GREEN, so other tokens cannot help unless converted via gold. Gold can only substitute one token. So I cannot afford L2_63 right now. I need one more GREEN token. 

Let's check if I can afford any other cards. Face-up cards: L1_6 (BLACK bonus, cost WHITE2, GREEN2). With my bonuses: BLACK2 reduces? Actually no bonus for WHITE or GREEN. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, so can't afford. L1_14 (BLUE bonus, cost GREEN2, BLACK2). With bonuses: BLACK2 covers BLACK2, so effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, so I can afford it. But L1_14 gives BLUE bonus which I already have 3, not needed. It uses 2 GREEN tokens, leaving me with GREEN1, which would make it harder to afford L2_63 later. However, purchasing L1_14 reduces token count, gives a card, but no prestige and no needed bonus. It might be better to take tokens to gather the missing GREEN token. 

L1_5 (BLACK bonus, cost GREEN2, RED1). With RED bonus, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, so can afford. Again, gives BLACK bonus not needed. L1_35 (RED bonus, cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2). With BLACK2 bonus, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, cannot afford. Higher level cards too expensive.

My best path is to get L2_63 as soon as possible because it gives GREEN bonus and 2 prestige. I need one more GREEN token. I have 10 tokens, so I cannot take more without returning. If I take tokens, I must return at least as many as I take, which is inefficient. Better to purchase an affordable card to reduce token count and maybe get a useful bonus. L1_14 is affordable and uses 2 GREEN tokens, reducing my token count to 8 (since I spend 2, total tokens go from 10 to 8). That frees up capacity to take more tokens next turn. However, it uses GREEN tokens which I need for L2_63. After purchasing L1_14, I'd have GREEN1 token, still need 4 more for L2_63 (since cost GREEN5, no bonus). That's a setback. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_5, also uses GREEN2, similar issue.

Maybe I should reserve another card? But I already have one reserved, and reserving doesn't help me afford L2_63. I could take tokens with returns: take GREEN=1 (but GREEN only has 1 on board), plus two other colors, and return some. That would give me GREEN4 tokens total (currently 3 +1), but I'd have to return tokens. Let's see board tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=4, GOLD=4. GREEN only has 1, so I can take GREEN=1. I must take exactly 3 different colors, but RED has 0, so I cannot take RED. So I could take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=1 (or BLUE). That would give me tokens: current 10 +3 =13, must return 3. I can return BLUE2 and something else. But then I'd have GREEN4, which is still not enough for L2_63 (need 5). I'd also have a gold token, so total GREEN resources 4 tokens +1 gold =5, exactly enough! Wait: after taking tokens, I'd have GREEN4 tokens (current 3 +1), plus my existing gold token (1), total 5 green resources. However, taking tokens would require returning 3 tokens, which is inefficient but might be necessary. But if I purchase L2_63 now, I can't because I'm short one green resource. So I need to either take tokens to get that one green, or use my gold to cover one, but I still need one more green token. Actually, I have GREEN3 tokens and 1 gold =4 resources, need 5. So I need one more green token. Taking tokens: if I take GREEN=1, I get GREEN4 tokens, plus gold =5. So after taking tokens (and returning some), I could purchase L2_63 next turn. But I'm at 10 tokens, so taking any tokens forces me to return at least that many. Taking 3 tokens means I must return 3 tokens. That's a net zero gain in token count, but I do get the specific colors I need. Let's simulate: take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=1 (since RED unavailable). My tokens become: WHITE=0+1=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3+1=4, RED=4, BLACK=0+1=1, GOLD=1. Total 13. I must return 3 tokens. I can return BLUE2 and RED1 (or RED2, but I need RED for future). Return BLUE2 and RED2? I'll return BLUE2 and RED2 to keep RED2. Then after return: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=4, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1. Total 9 tokens. Next turn, I can purchase L2_63 using GREEN4 tokens +1 gold =5 resources. That works. But this is a two-step plan: take tokens with returns now, purchase next turn. 

Alternatively, I could purchase L1_14 now to reduce token count and get a card, but it delays L2_63 and wastes GREEN tokens. Better to go directly for L2_63. 

Another option: reserve a card to get a gold token? I have 10 tokens, so reserving would give me a gold token (if available) and I must return a token if over 10. But I already have a gold token, and reserving doesn't give me the green token I need. Not helpful.

Thus, the best move is to take tokens to acquire the missing green token, even though it requires returning tokens. I must ensure I take exactly 3 different colors. Available colors with tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=4. RED=0 so cannot take RED. So I'll take GREEN=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=1. I'll return tokens to stay at 10. I'll return BLUE2 and RED1 (since I have RED4, can spare 1). That will leave me with tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=4, RED=3, BLACK=1, GOLD=1. Total 10. Next turn, I can purchase L2_63 using GREEN4 + GOLD1. That is optimal.

I will execute TAKE_TOKENS with take_GREEN=1, take_WHITE=1, take_BLACK=1, and return_BLUE=2, return_RED=1.

======================================================================================

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have tokens: BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=1. Total tokens: 10. Bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. I have a reserved card L2_63 (GREEN bonus, prestige 2, cost GREEN5). This card gives me the GREEN bonus I need for noble N9 (requires GREEN3). Currently I have 0 GREEN bonuses, so this will be my first. It also gives 2 prestige points, bringing my score to 3. To afford L2_63, cost is GREEN5. My bonuses: I have no GREEN bonus, so no reduction. But I have a GOLD token that can substitute for any color. I have 3 GREEN tokens. So I need 2 more GREEN. I can use the GOLD token as 2 GREEN? Actually, gold substitutes one-for-one, so one gold token can cover one missing GREEN. I need 5 GREEN total, I have 3, so I need 2 more. I have 1 gold, which covers 1, leaving me 1 short. Wait, I also have other tokens: BLUE, RED. But they cannot substitute unless I use gold. I could potentially purchase L2_63 by paying with my 3 GREEN tokens + 1 gold token + 1 more token? No, gold is only one token, so it can only cover one missing GREEN. I need to pay exactly the cost using tokens and bonuses. The cost is GREEN5. I have 3 GREEN tokens, so I need 2 additional GREEN. But I can use gold as any color, including GREEN. So I can use 1 gold as 1 GREEN. That still leaves me 1 short. However, I can also use other tokens? No, the cost is specifically GREEN5, so I must provide 5 GREEN tokens or use bonuses (which I don't have) or gold. I cannot use BLUE tokens to pay for GREEN. So I cannot afford L2_63 right now because I only have 3 GREEN tokens + 1 gold = 4 effective GREEN. I need one more GREEN token. I should take tokens to get more GREEN. But I am at 10 tokens, so taking tokens would require returning tokens. Alternatively, I could purchase a different card that I can afford to reduce my token count, then next turn take tokens to get GREEN. Let's check face-up cards for affordability. L1_14: cost GREEN2, BLACK2. My bonuses: BLACK2 covers BLACK2, so effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, so I can afford it. But it gives BLUE bonus, which I already have 3, and no prestige. Purchasing it would use 2 GREEN tokens, leaving me with 1 GREEN, making L2_63 even harder. Not good. L1_5: cost GREEN2, RED1. My RED bonus reduces RED cost to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, can afford. But it gives BLACK bonus, not needed, no prestige. Same issue: uses GREEN tokens. L1_35: cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2. My BLACK2 covers BLACK2, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have no WHITE tokens, but I have gold that can cover WHITE. I have GREEN3, so I could use 1 GREEN and 1 gold for WHITE? Actually, I need WHITE2. I have 0 WHITE tokens. I have 1 gold, which can cover 1 WHITE. Still need 1 more WHITE. So cannot afford fully. L2_62: cost BLUE5, GREEN3. My BLUE3 bonus reduces BLUE cost by 3, so BLUE cost becomes 2. I have BLUE2 tokens, so that covers BLUE2. GREEN cost 3, I have GREEN3 tokens, so I can afford L2_62! That gives GREEN bonus (which I need) and 2 prestige. That's even better than L2_63 because it's on the board, costs fewer GREEN tokens, and gives the same GREEN bonus and prestige. Checking: L2_62: bonus GREEN, prestige 2, cost BLUE5, GREEN3. After bonuses: BLUE5 - BLUE3 = BLUE2, I have BLUE2 tokens. GREEN3, I have GREEN3 tokens. So I can pay exactly with my tokens: BLUE2 + GREEN3 = total 5 tokens, no gold needed. That would reduce my token count to 5 (since I have 10 now, spending 5). That's perfect! I get a GREEN bonus, 2 prestige, and free up token slots. This advances me significantly towards N9: now I'll have BLUE3, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK2. I'll need two more GREEN bonuses and two more RED bonuses to satisfy N9. But this is a great step. Also, my score becomes 3 (current 1 + 2). I should purchase L2_62 now. It's available on the board. No other card gives me such direct progress. I must verify that L2_62 is indeed face-up: in the game state, under LEVEL_2, id L2_62 is present. Yes. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L2_62.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_63]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_63
Reasoning: I am at 10 tokens (BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, GOLD=1). My goal is noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I have BLUE3 bonus, RED1, GREEN0. I need GREEN bonuses. I reserved L2_63 (GREEN bonus, cost GREEN5). I currently have GREEN3 tokens, need 2 more GREEN to afford L2_63 (5 total). Board tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=4. RED has 0, so I cannot take RED. I must take 3 different colors or 2 of same if 4+ available. GREEN only 1, cannot take 2 GREEN. So I need 3 different colors. I can take GREEN=1 (since I need GREEN), then choose two others from WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. I should avoid taking tokens that require returning, but I am at 10 tokens, so any taking will require returning. However, if I take 3 tokens, I must return 3 to stay at 10. That's inefficient. Better alternative: purchase an affordable card to reduce token count and advance position. I can check affordable cards: L1_5 (cost GREEN2, RED1) after bonuses: RED1 reduces RED to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, so I can afford. But it gives BLACK bonus, not helpful. L1_14 (cost GREEN2, BLACK2) after bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK2 to 0, effective cost GREEN2. I have GREEN3, can afford. It gives BLUE bonus (I already have BLUE3). L1_35 (cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2) after bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK2 to 0, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, GOLD1. I can use GOLD for WHITE, but need WHITE2 tokens; I have 0 WHITE, 1 GOLD can substitute for 1 WHITE, still short 1 WHITE. So cannot afford. L1_6 (cost WHITE2, GREEN2) after bonuses: no bonus reduction, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN2. I have WHITE0, GREEN3, GOLD1. GOLD can substitute for WHITE1, still need WHITE1 more, so cannot afford. Higher level cards too expensive. So only L1_5 and L1_14 are affordable. Both use GREEN tokens, which I need for L2_63. However, purchasing L1_14 would use 2 GREEN tokens, leaving me with GREEN1, making L2_63 further away. But purchasing a card reduces token count to 8, freeing capacity to take more tokens next turn. Also, L1_14 gives BLUE bonus, which is redundant but might help for other purchases? Not really. L1_5 gives BLACK bonus, which I don't need. Neither gives GREEN bonus. However, I could reserve a card to get a gold and maybe a GREEN bonus card from deck? But I already have L2_63 reserved. I could reserve another card, but that would require returning a token (since I have 10 tokens). Reserving gives 1 gold, but I already have 1 gold. That might be okay. Alternatively, I could take tokens and return tokens, but that wastes a turn. The best move is to purchase L1_14 because it uses 2 GREEN tokens and 0 BLACK tokens (since BLACK bonus covers), reducing my token count to 8 (since I spend 2 GREEN). That leaves me with tokens: BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=4, GOLD=1, total 8. Then next turn I can take more GREEN tokens to work towards L2_63. However, L1_14 does not give me any new bonus I need. But it does give me 0 prestige points. It's a low-value purchase, but it reduces token count and might reveal a new card that gives GREEN bonus. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_5, which also uses 2 GREEN tokens, same effect. Neither is great. But I must avoid returning tokens if possible. Purchasing is better than taking+returning. So I will purchase L1_14. Wait, but my previous reasoning was to purchase L2_63, but I cannot afford it because I need 5 GREEN tokens and only have 3. I need 2 more GREEN tokens. To get them, I need to take tokens. But taking tokens while at 10 requires returning, which is inefficient. So I should purchase something to free up token capacity. L1_14 is the best affordable card that uses GREEN tokens. After purchasing, I'll be at 8 tokens, then I can take 3 tokens (including GREEN) next turn without returning. That seems like a plan. However, I should also consider that my opponent has 5 points and is ahead. I need to catch up. L2_63 gives 2 prestige points and GREEN bonus, which is valuable. So I should work towards that. Purchasing L1_14 delays that but is necessary to free capacity. Alternatively, I could reserve a level 1 card blindly to get a gold and hope for a GREEN bonus card, but that would require returning a token and not advancing my board. Not good. So I'll purchase L1_14. Let's verify cost: L1_14 cost GREEN2, BLACK2. My bonuses: BLACK2 reduces BLACK cost to 0. So I need to pay 2 GREEN tokens. I have GREEN3, so I can pay. I will use 2 GREEN tokens. I have GOLD1, but no need to use it. So final tokens after purchase: BLUE2, GREEN1, RED4, GOLD1, total 8. That's valid. I'll set action_type PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_14.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens (BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=4, GOLD=1) and bonuses BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. I need GREEN bonuses for noble N9 (GREEN3) and RED bonuses (currently RED1). I have reserved L2_63 (cost GREEN5, gives GREEN bonus and 2 prestige). To purchase it, I need 5 GREEN tokens; I have 3 GREEN tokens and 1 gold (can substitute for 1 GREEN). So I need 1 more GREEN token. However, board GREEN tokens count is 1, and RED tokens count is 0. I cannot take RED tokens because there are none. Taking 3 tokens of different colors: I can take GREEN=1 (since GREEN has 1 token, I can take it). I must take exactly 3 different colors. Available colors with tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=4, GOLD=3 (but gold cannot be taken). So I can take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1. That would give me tokens: BLUE=3, GREEN=4, RED=4, WHITE=1, GOLD=1 (total 13). I must return 3 tokens. I can return BLUE=2 and WHITE=1 (since I don't need them for L2_63 or N9). Net tokens after returning: BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=4, GOLD=1 (total 10). That gives me the needed GREEN count (4) plus gold to buy L2_63 (cost GREEN5: 4 tokens + gold). Alternatively, I could take WHITE=1, BLACK=1, GREEN=1. But BLACK is not needed. I'll prioritize taking WHITE, BLUE, GREEN because BLUE might be useful for other purchases. However, I need to return tokens anyway. Another option: take 2 of the same color if 4+ available. WHITE has 4, BLACK has 4. I could take 2 WHITE tokens. That would give me WHITE=2, plus current tokens, total 12, return 2 tokens. But taking WHITE doesn't help me purchase L2_63 or get GREEN bonuses. So taking 3 different colors including GREEN is better. Therefore, I'll take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, and return BLUE=2, WHITE=1 (returning the ones I just took plus one extra BLUE). That leaves me with GREEN=4, RED=4, GOLD=1, BLUE=1 (total 10). Then next turn I can purchase L2_63 using 4 GREEN tokens + 1 gold. That will give me GREEN bonus, 2 prestige, and reduce my token count. This is the most efficient move towards N9 and scoring. Purchasing now is not possible because I can't afford L2_63 yet (need 1 more GREEN token). Reserving another card is not helpful as I already have a good reserved card. So TAKE_TOKENS is correct.

Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=4, GOLD=1. Bonuses: BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=2. Reserved card L2_63 cost GREEN5, gives GREEN bonus and 2 prestige. Effective cost after bonuses: GREEN5 (no bonus reduction). I have 4 GREEN tokens and 1 gold token (substitutes for any color). That's exactly 5 GREEN-equivalent resources. I can afford it now. Purchasing it will give me 2 prestige points (bringing total to 3), a GREEN bonus (first one, so now GREEN=1), and reduce my token count by 5 (using 4 GREEN and 1 gold). That will leave me with tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=0, RED=4, GOLD=0, total 5 tokens, well under 10. This advances my goal towards noble N9: I now have BLUE3, GREEN1, RED1. I need 2 more GREEN and 2 more RED bonuses. After purchase, I can focus on acquiring RED and GREEN bonuses. Face-up cards: L1_5 gives BLACK (not needed), L1_35 gives RED (cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2) but with my BLACK2 bonus, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1; I have no WHITE tokens, so not affordable yet. L2_62 gives GREEN bonus (2 prestige) but cost BLUE5, GREEN3; I have BLUE bonus 3, so effective cost BLUE2, GREEN3; I have BLUE1 token and GREEN0, not affordable. L3_88 gives RED bonus (4 prestige) but cost GREEN7; not affordable. So purchasing L2_63 is the best immediate move. Taking tokens would be inefficient because I'm already at 10 tokens and would have to return some. Reserving another card is unnecessary. Therefore, I will purchase L2_63.

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens (BLUE=1, GREEN=0, RED=4, GOLD=0) after purchasing L2_63 last turn. I need to collect tokens to afford cards that give GREEN or RED bonuses to progress towards noble N9 (needs GREEN3, RED3; currently GREEN1, RED1). Face-up cards: L1_35 gives RED bonus, cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2; with my BLACK2 bonus, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have no WHITE tokens, but I can take WHITE tokens now. L2_62 gives GREEN bonus (2 prestige), cost BLUE5, GREEN3; with BLUE3 bonus, effective BLUE2, GREEN3; I have BLUE1 token, need more BLUE and GREEN. L3_88 gives RED bonus (4 prestige), cost GREEN7, too expensive. L3_89 gives RED bonus, cost BLUE3, GREEN6, RED3; after bonuses, effective BLUE0 (BLUE3 covers), GREEN6, RED2 (since RED1 bonus); still expensive. My priority is to get affordable RED or GREEN bonus cards. L1_35 is the most affordable: need WHITE2 and GREEN1. I have GREEN0, RED4, BLUE1. Board tokens: WHITE=4, BLUE=3, GREEN=4, RED=0, BLACK=4, GOLD=4. RED is out, cannot take RED. I can take WHITE, GREEN, and another color. Since I need WHITE and GREEN for L1_35, I'll take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, and a third color. BLUE is useful for L2_62, but I need more BLUE tokens (I have BLUE1, need BLUE2 after bonuses). So taking BLUE=1 is good. That gives me tokens: BLUE=2, GREEN=1, WHITE=1, RED=4, total 8 tokens (within limit). Then next turn I could afford L1_35 if I get one more WHITE token (need WHITE2 total). Alternatively, I could take 2 WHITE tokens now (since WHITE has 4, so 2 of same color allowed). That would give me WHITE=2, plus current tokens, total 9 tokens. But then I'd still need GREEN1 to buy L1_35, and I could take GREEN next turn. However, taking 2 WHITE now would require taking exactly 2 tokens of same color, which is allowed. That would be more efficient towards L1_35. But note: I must take EXACTLY 2 tokens of same color if I choose that option, not 3 different. So I could take WHITE=2. That gives me WHITE=2, current tokens BLUE=1, RED=4, total 7 tokens. Then next turn I could take GREEN=1 (and maybe another color) to afford L1_35. However, I also need to consider that I might want to purchase L2_62 in the future, which requires BLUE and GREEN. Taking WHITE=2 doesn't help with that. But L1_35 gives RED bonus, which is directly useful for N9. It also gives 0 prestige, but that's okay. I think taking 3 different colors (WHITE, GREEN, BLUE) is more balanced and progresses both L1_35 and L2_62. I'll do that. So action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_WHITE=1, take_GREEN=1, take_BLUE=1. No returns needed because I'll have 8 tokens total.

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=4, BLACK=0, GOLD=0 (total 8). My bonuses: BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. Goal: noble N9 (BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I need 2 more GREEN and 2 more RED bonuses. I can see face-up cards: L1_35 gives RED bonus, cost WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2; with my BLACK2 bonus, effective cost WHITE2, GREEN1. I have WHITE=1, GREEN=1, so I need one more WHITE token to afford it. Alternatively, L2_62 gives GREEN bonus (2 prestige), cost BLUE5, GREEN3; with BLUE3 bonus, effective BLUE2, GREEN3; I have BLUE=2 tokens, GREEN=1 token, so I need more GREEN tokens (2 more) and possibly more BLUE (0 more after bonus). Also L2_68 gives RED bonus (2 prestige), cost WHITE3, BLACK5; after bonuses, effective WHITE3, BLACK3 (since BLACK2 bonus); I have WHITE=1, BLACK=0, so not close. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=4, GOLD=5. RED is out (0). I need to collect tokens to afford either L1_35 or L2_62. Since L1_35 is cheaper and gives RED bonus (needed), I'll aim to get that next. To afford L1_35, I need WHITE2 and GREEN1. I currently have WHITE1, GREEN1, so I need one more WHITE token. I could take WHITE=1, but I must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of the same if 4+ available. WHITE has 3 tokens, so I cannot take 2 WHITE (needs 4+). So I must take 3 different colors. I'll take WHITE=1, plus two other colors that are useful for future purchases. GREEN is useful for L2_62, but I already have GREEN1 and need GREEN3 for L2_62, so more GREEN is good. BLUE is also useful for L2_62. So I'll take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLUE=1. That would give me tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=4, total 11 tokens? Wait, I currently have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=4. Adding WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 gives WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=4, total 11 tokens (2+3+2+4=11). That exceeds 10, so I need to return 1 token. I can return RED=1 (since I have many RED and don't need it immediately). That would leave me with WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3, total 10 tokens. Then next turn I can afford L1_35 (needs WHITE2, GREEN1; I have exactly that). Purchasing L1_35 would give me RED bonus, increasing RED bonus to 2, and 0 prestige. Alternatively, I could take 2 BLACK tokens (since BLACK has 4+), but BLACK is not needed for my immediate goals. Taking 2 BLACK would give me BLACK=2, but I'd still need WHITE and GREEN for L1_35. That seems less efficient. So the best move is to take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLUE=1, and return RED=1. This sets me up to buy L1_35 next turn, advancing my RED bonus towards N9. I should also consider that opponent has 9 prestige and might win soon, but I have 3 prestige and need to catch up. L1_35 gives no prestige, but it's a step towards noble N9 (3 prestige). I might also consider reserving a card, but I don't have any reserved cards currently and reserving might slow me down. Taking tokens is the right move to gather resources for immediate purchase.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=6, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3. My bonuses: BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I can afford L1_35 (cost: WHITE2, GREEN1, BLACK2). After applying my BLACK2 bonus, the effective cost is WHITE2, GREEN1. I have exactly WHITE2 and GREEN1 tokens, so I can purchase it without using gold. This will give me a RED bonus (increasing RED from 1 to 2) and 0 prestige. It also reduces my token count by 3 (using 2 WHITE and 1 GREEN), leaving me with tokens: BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=3, WHITE=0, total 7 tokens. This advances me toward noble N9 (now BLUE3, GREEN1, RED2). I need 2 more GREEN and 1 more RED bonuses. I should next aim for a GREEN bonus card like L2_62 (cost BLUE5, GREEN3; effective BLUE2, GREEN3 after bonuses). I have BLUE3 tokens and GREEN1 token, so I need more GREEN tokens. Taking tokens now would be possible, but purchasing L1_35 is immediate and progresses my engine. My opponent has 9 prestige and could win soon, so I need to score points. However, L1_35 gives no points, but it gets me closer to N9 (3 points). Considering the board, L2_62 is still available and gives 2 prestige plus a GREEN bonus, which would be great. But I cannot afford it yet. Purchasing L1_35 now is efficient and frees up my token count for future token gathering. Alternatively, I could take tokens to get more GREEN and BLUE for L2_62, but that would delay progress. Since I can afford L1_35 now, I should buy it. Also, note that if I take tokens, I would exceed 10 tokens and need to return some. My current total is 10? Wait, I have WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3, total 10 tokens. If I take tokens, I would have to return tokens, which is wasteful. Purchasing L1_35 reduces my token count to 7, allowing me to take more tokens next turn. Therefore, purchasing is the best move.

Points: 3, Budget: {BLU=6, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 0 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 3 RED, 0 BLACK, 0 GOLD tokens (total 8). My bonuses: BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. I need to progress towards noble N9 (requires BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I currently have BLUE3, GREEN1, RED2. So I need 2 more GREEN bonuses and 1 more RED bonus. Face-up cards: L2_62 gives GREEN bonus and 2 prestige, cost BLUE5, GREEN3. With my BLUE3 bonus, effective cost: BLUE2, GREEN3. I have BLUE=3 tokens, GREEN=2 tokens, so I need 1 more GREEN token to afford it. Alternatively, L1_39 gives RED bonus and 0 prestige, cost WHITE3. With my bonuses (no WHITE), effective cost WHITE3. I have WHITE=0 tokens, not close. L2_68 gives RED bonus and 2 prestige, cost WHITE3, BLACK5. With BLACK2 bonus, effective WHITE3, BLACK3. I have WHITE=0, BLACK=0. Not close. L3_88 gives RED bonus and 4 prestige, cost GREEN7. Too expensive. My best immediate target is L2_62. To afford L2_62, I need 1 more GREEN token. I could take tokens to get that GREEN. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=3, GOLD=5. I can take GREEN=1, but must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of same color if 4+ available. GREEN has 2 tokens, so cannot take 2 GREEN (needs 4+). So I must take 3 different colors. I need GREEN, so take GREEN=1. I also need BLUE? I have enough BLUE tokens (3) for L2_62 after bonuses (need BLUE2). But taking BLUE might be useful for other cards. However, board BLUE is only 1, so I can take BLUE=1. That would be GREEN=1, BLUE=1, and a third color. WHITE is available (3 tokens), but WHITE is not needed for my immediate goals. BLACK is also available (3 tokens), but BLACK is not needed. RED is available (1 token), but I don't need more RED currently. I'll take WHITE as the third color to have flexibility. So take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1. That would give me tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=4, GREEN=3, RED=3, total 11 tokens. That exceeds 10, so I need to return 1 token. I can return RED=1 (since I have many RED tokens and don't need them immediately). After returning RED=1, I'll have WHITE=1, BLUE=4, GREEN=3, RED=2, total 10 tokens. Then next turn I can afford L2_62 (needs BLUE2, GREEN3; I'll have BLUE4, GREEN3, so I can use BLUE2, GREEN3). That purchase will give me 2 prestige and a GREEN bonus, bringing my GREEN bonus to 2, and moving me closer to N9. It also reduces my token count. Alternatively, I could take 2 BLACK tokens (since BLACK has 3 tokens, not 4+, so cannot take 2 BLACK). That's invalid. Taking 2 WHITE is not allowed because WHITE has 3 tokens. So the only valid take is 3 different colors. I should also consider that opponent has 12 prestige and might win soon. I need to score points quickly. L2_62 gives 2 prestige, which helps. I could also consider reserving a high-point card, but reserving doesn't score points immediately and I have no reserved cards currently. Taking tokens to afford L2_62 is the fastest path to points. Therefore, I'll take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, and return RED=1.

Reasoning: I have 10 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=4, GREEN=3, RED=2) and can afford L2_62 immediately. Its cost is BLUE5, GREEN3; my bonuses (BLUE=3, GREEN=1) reduce the effective cost to BLUE2, GREEN2. I have sufficient tokens (4 BLUE, 3 GREEN) to cover this. Purchasing now scores 2 prestige (bringing my total to 5), gives a GREEN bonus (increasing GREEN from 1 to 2, moving me closer to noble N9), and reduces my token count to 6, freeing capacity for future turns. Opponent has 12 prestige and is close to winning, so scoring points quickly is critical. Taking tokens would require returning tokens due to the 10-token limit, which is wasteful. Therefore, purchasing L2_62 is the optimal move.

Turn 32 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=0 (total 6). Bonuses: BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2. I need to progress towards noble N9 (requires BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I currently have BLUE3, GREEN2, RED2, so I need 1 more GREEN and 1 more RED bonus. Face-up cards: L1_39 gives RED bonus (0 prestige), cost WHITE3; after bonuses, effective WHITE3 (no WHITE bonus). I have WHITE=1 token, not close. L2_68 gives RED bonus (2 prestige), cost WHITE3, BLACK5; after BLACK2 bonus, effective WHITE3, BLACK3; I have WHITE=1, BLACK=0. L2_67 gives RED bonus (2 prestige), cost WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2; after bonuses, effective WHITE1 (no bonus), BLUE1 (BLUE3 bonus covers 3, so BLUE4-3=1), GREEN0 (GREEN2 bonus covers 2). I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, so I need 0 BLUE (I have 2, need 1), 0 GREEN, 1 WHITE. Actually, effective cost is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN0. I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, so I can afford L2_67 now! That gives 2 prestige and a RED bonus, increasing RED to 3, which fulfills the RED requirement for N9. Plus it gives points. That's a great move. Alternatively, I could aim for a GREEN bonus card to get GREEN3. L2_42 gives BLACK bonus (1 prestige), not helpful. L3_85 gives GREEN bonus (4 prestige), cost WHITE3, BLUE6, GREEN3; after bonuses, effective WHITE3, BLUE3 (BLUE3 covers 3), GREEN1 (GREEN2 covers 2). I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, so need more. Not immediate. L3_88 gives RED bonus (4 prestige), cost GREEN7; after GREEN2 bonus, effective GREEN5, too expensive. L3_89 gives RED bonus (4 prestige), cost BLUE3, GREEN6, RED3; after bonuses, effective BLUE0, GREEN4 (GREEN2 covers 2), RED1 (RED2 covers 2). I have BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, so need more GREEN. Not immediate. L2_58 gives WHITE bonus (3 prestige), cost WHITE6; after no WHITE bonus, effective WHITE6, too expensive. So L2_67 is the best immediate purchase: it gives 2 prestige and the needed RED bonus. However, I cannot afford it this turn because I need to pay WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN0. I have exactly WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, so I can pay WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN0 (using BLUE2, WHITE1). That leaves me with tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, WHITE=0, total 4 tokens. That's fine. But wait, I must check if I have enough tokens to cover the cost without using gold. The cost is WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2. My bonuses: BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2, WHITE=0. So after bonuses, I need: WHITE1 (since no WHITE bonus), BLUE1 (BLUE4 - 3 = 1), GREEN0 (GREEN2 - 2 = 0). I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1. So I can pay WHITE1, BLUE1, and I don't need to pay GREEN because bonus covers it. So yes, I can purchase L2_67 now. However, my reasoning says I should purchase it. But is there a reason not to? I should consider that opponent is at 12 prestige and may win soon. I need to score points quickly. L2_67 gives 2 prestige, bringing me to 7, still behind. But it also gives RED bonus, which gets me closer to N9 (3 prestige) if I can also get GREEN3. So after purchasing L2_67, my RED bonus becomes 3, and I still need GREEN3. I have GREEN2 currently. So I need one more GREEN bonus. I could then aim for a GREEN bonus card like L1_14 (BLUE bonus, not GREEN), L1_5 (BLACK bonus), L1_20 (WHITE bonus), L1_39 (RED bonus). None give GREEN. So there is no face-up GREEN bonus card currently. That's a problem. I may need to reserve a GREEN card from the deck, or wait for one to appear. Alternatively, I could consider purchasing L2_42 (BLACK bonus, 1 prestige) but that doesn't help GREEN. Or L3_85 (GREEN bonus, 4 prestige) but it's expensive. I might need to collect tokens to afford L3_85. But let's check effective cost again: WHITE3, BLUE6, GREEN3; after bonuses: WHITE3, BLUE3 (since BLUE3 covers 3), GREEN1 (since GREEN2 covers 2). So I need WHITE3, BLUE3, GREEN1. I currently have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, so I need 2 more WHITE and 1 more BLUE. That's not too far. But L3_85 gives 4 prestige, which is significant. However, opponent might win before I can afford it. Alternatively, I could purchase L2_67 now and then next turn take tokens to work towards L3_85 or reserve a GREEN card. But if I purchase L2_67 now, I reduce my token count to 4, allowing me to take 3 tokens next turn. That could be WHITE, BLUE, and maybe GREEN. That would get me closer to L3_85. Also, note that noble N9 requires BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3. After purchasing L2_67, I have BLUE3, GREEN2, RED3. So I only need one more GREEN bonus. If I can get a GREEN bonus from any source (e.g., a level 1 card that gives GREEN), I can attract N9 for 3 prestige, bringing my total to 10 (7+3). That would be close to opponent's 12. So my priority should be to get a GREEN bonus card. Since none are face-up, I should consider reserving a GREEN card from the deck. But reserving doesn't give points immediately. Alternatively, I could take tokens now to afford L3_85 later. Let's evaluate: If I take tokens now, I can take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN to work towards L3_85. But I currently have 6 tokens, so I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10. If I take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, I'll have WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, total 9 tokens. Then next turn I could purchase L2_67 (since I can afford it) and still have tokens left. But purchasing L2_67 uses WHITE1, BLUE1, so after purchase I'd have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, total 7 tokens. That's fine. But that delays the purchase by one turn. Since opponent is at 12, I need to score points as soon as possible. Purchasing L2_67 this turn gives me 2 points immediately. That's better. So I should purchase L2_67 now. But wait, I need to verify that I have enough tokens to cover the cost after bonuses. The cost is WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2. My bonuses: BLUE3, GREEN2. So I need to pay: WHITE1 (since no WHITE bonus), BLUE1 (4-3), GREEN0 (2-2). I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=0. So I can pay WHITE1, BLUE1, and I don't need to pay GREEN. That's correct. So I can purchase L2_67. It will give me 2 prestige, RED bonus, and reduce my tokens. That seems optimal. However, I should also consider that after purchasing, my token count will be 4 (WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2). That's low, which is fine because I can take more tokens next turn. But there is a risk that opponent wins on their next turn. They have 12 prestige, and they need 15 to win. They might be able to purchase a high-point card or attract a noble. I need to hurry. Purchasing L2_67 gives me 2 points, not enough to catch up, but it gets me closer to N9. I might also consider if there is a card I can purchase that gives more points. L3_85 gives 4 points but I can't afford it yet. L2_58 gives 3 points but cost WHITE6, too expensive. L2_68 gives 2 points but I can't afford. So L2_67 is the best I can afford. Therefore, I will purchase L2_67. But I must double-check that L2_67 is still face-up. In the current game state, under faceUpCards LEVEL_2, I see L2_42, L2_68, L2_58, L2_67. Yes, L2_67 is there. So I can purchase it. Therefore, action_type should be PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L2_67. However, I also need to consider that I have 0 reserved cards, so I could reserve a card if I think that's better. But reserving doesn't give points now. Given the urgency, purchasing is better. So I'll purchase L2_67.

Reasoning: I have 6 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2 (total 6). My bonuses: BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2. I need to progress towards noble N9 (requires BLUE3, GREEN3, RED3). I currently have BLUE3, GREEN2, RED2, so I need 1 more GREEN and 1 more RED bonus. I also have 5 prestige points, opponent has 12, so I need to score points quickly. Face-up cards: L1_39 gives RED bonus and 0 prestige, cost WHITE3. After bonuses, effective cost WHITE3 (no WHITE bonus). I have WHITE=1 token, need 2 more. L2_68 gives RED bonus and 2 prestige, cost WHITE3, BLACK5. After BLACK2 bonus, effective WHITE3, BLACK3. I have WHITE=1, BLACK=0. L2_67 gives RED bonus and 2 prestige, cost WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2. After bonuses, effective WHITE1, BLUE1 (BLUE3 bonus covers 3), GREEN0 (GREEN2 covers 2). I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, so I need to cover WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN0. That means I need 1 more BLUE token to afford L2_67 (since BLUE cost after bonus is 1, I have 2, so I can cover it). Actually, re-calc: cost WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2. Bonuses: BLUE3, GREEN2. So net: WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN0. I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1. So I can afford L2_67 right now? Yes, I have enough tokens: use WHITE1, BLUE1 (since net BLUE1), and I don't need to spend GREEN because net GREEN0. That would use 2 tokens, leaving me with tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2. Purchasing L2_67 gives 2 prestige and a RED bonus, increasing RED bonus to 3, which satisfies RED requirement for N9. Then I would have BLUE3, GREEN2, RED3, so I still need 1 GREEN bonus for N9. That's good. But wait, I have only 6 tokens, so purchasing L2_67 is possible and would give me points. However, I should check if there are any other cards that give GREEN bonus and points. L2_62 is gone (I bought it). L1_14 gives BLUE bonus, not helpful. L1_5 gives BLACK bonus. L1_20 gives WHITE bonus. L2_42 gives BLACK bonus. L2_58 gives WHITE bonus. L3 cards are expensive. So L2_67 is the best immediate purchase for points and needed RED bonus. Alternatively, I could take tokens to set up for a higher-point card, but since opponent is at 12, I need to score now. Purchasing L2_67 gives 2 prestige, bringing me to 7, and gets me closer to N9 (3 more) for total 10. Opponent likely will win next turn if they can score 3 more points. I need to see if I can win faster. If I purchase L2_67, I'll have 7 prestige, and if I can attract noble N9 (needs GREEN3, but I have GREEN2), I would need one more GREEN bonus. I could try to buy a GREEN bonus card next turn, but there's none affordable currently. L1_5 gives BLACK, not GREEN. L1_14 gives BLUE. L1_20 gives WHITE. So I might need to reserve or draw blind. But maybe I can take tokens now to afford a GREEN bonus card later. However, purchasing L2_67 now is good because it uses tokens and scores points. After purchasing, I'll have 4 tokens left, so I can take 3 tokens next turn to aim for a GREEN card. Let's see if I can afford any GREEN card now: L3_85 gives GREEN bonus and 4 prestige, cost WHITE3, BLUE6, GREEN3. After bonuses, net WHITE3, BLUE3 (BLUE3 covers 3), GREEN1 (GREEN2 covers 2). I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, so not enough. L3_89 gives RED bonus, cost BLUE3, GREEN6, RED3; net BLUE0, GREEN4 (since GREEN2), RED1 (since RED2). Need GREEN4, not close. So L2_67 is the best purchase. Therefore, I should purchase L2_67. But wait, I need to ensure the card is available. L2_67 is in the face-up cards. Yes. So action_type should be PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L2_67. However, I should double-check my token counts: I have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2. Cost: WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2. Bonuses: BLUE3, GREEN2. So after applying bonuses, I need to pay: WHITE1, BLUE1 (since BLUE4 - BLUE3 = 1), GREEN0 (since GREEN2 - GREEN2 = 0). So I need to spend WHITE1 and BLUE1. I have those. So purchase is valid. This will leave me with tokens: WHITE0, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED2 (total 4). And I'll gain 2 prestige and RED bonus. That seems optimal. But let's consider if there is any other card I can buy that gives GREEN bonus. None. So I'll purchase L2_67.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I am at 5 prestige, opponent at 12, so I need to score points quickly. I can afford L2_67 (RED bonus, 2 prestige) with one more GREEN token, which would also complete my RED requirement for noble N9. To get the GREEN token, I must take tokens. Since GREEN has only 2 on board, I cannot take 2 GREEN (requires 4+ available), so I must take 3 different colors. I take GREEN, WHITE, and BLUE, which gives me sufficient tokens to purchase L2_67 next turn while staying under the token limit (current 6 + 3 = 9). This advances my position toward immediate points and progressing to noble N9.

Turn 32 - Player 1's move
Points: 12, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=6, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 32, holding W1 G1 R1 Bk2 Gold1 (total6), bonuses W2 B4 G1 R4 Bk4 score12 >> opp5, reserved L1_24(1pt W G4 eff G3), L3_82(5pt W3 Bk7 eff W1 Bk3). Perfectly positioned per plan from turn31: Now PURCHASE L3_82 (reserved, cost W3 Bk7 - W2 Bk4 = W1 Bk3 pay W1 Bk2 + Gold1(Bk) exact → leftover G1 R1 total2). Gain 5pt (score17 win) + W3 bonus (elite engine). Secures victory immediate (17 >> opp5 max possible ~10-12 even aggressive). No better: can't buy higher (none); L2_68 eff W1 Bk1 pay nothing (have but short? Wait have exact but 2pt inferior); L1_24 G3 no (G1 short2); no nobles yet (N1 short W2→post W3 short1; N9 short G2); take tokens delays win (e.g. board low1s can't 2same); reserve other unnecessary. Opp (9tokens W2 B3 G2 R2 total9, bonuses B3 G2 R2 Bk2 score5, no res) threats low: e.g. L2_67 eff? W1 B1 G0 pay low +2pt R; L2_58 W3? Short; L3s impossible (no Bk/W high); L1s 0pt; N9 short W0? No B3=3 G2=2<3 R2=2<3. Can't catch 17. Efficient max pts immediate (17 now), L3_82 secured wins game while opp stalls low pts preventing any catchup. Races to15+ (over) securing victory.
