Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Turn 1: I have no bonuses or resources, so I need to start building up gems. Looking at the board, I'll RESERVE L1_32 (green bonus, 1 prestige point, cost BLACK 4) - this is a strong early card because the black cost is easy to acquire early and it's a cheap point scorer. I'll also take tokens. Since I have 0 tokens now and taking 3 won't exceed 10, I can take freely. I'll take WHITE, GREEN, and BLUE. These colors give me flexibility: WHITE/GREEN for the L2_54 and L3_78 cards, BLUE for L2_50 and L3_78. I avoid RED and BLACK initially since those high-cost cards (L1_36, L1_3, L3_72, L3_81) are expensive. This reserves a solid early game card while building a balanced token foundation for future purchases.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_32, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Turn 1 opening move. I need to establish my engine by getting my first bonus card quickly. L1_17 is the most efficient Level 1 card, costing only 4 tokens (1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK) and providing a WHITE bonus. By taking BLUE, RED, and BLACK now, I'll have 3/4 colors needed. Next turn I can take GREEN plus two other tokens and purchase L1_17 immediately. The WHITE bonus positions me for nobles N3 (4 WHITE + 4 BLACK) or N6 (3 each BLUE/WHITE/BLACK), avoiding competition with my opponent who reserved a GREEN bonus card (L1_32), likely targeting N2 (4 GREEN + 4 RED). This focused approach gets me a bonus by turn 2.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GLD=1}
Reasoning: After Turn 1, I have 1 GOLD token from reserving L1_32 (which costs BLACK 4). My next move needs to advance toward acquiring that card while also building my resource base.

Looking at available BLACK tokens on board: 3 available, which is enough to take 2 of the same color.

Option 1: Take 2 BLACK tokens directly
- This gives me tokens I need for L1_32
- But L1_32 costs 4 BLACK total, so I'd need 2 more BLACKs later

Option 2: Reserve L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 prestige points, cost WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1)
- Gets me a GOLD token (currently 4 available)
- Gives me BLACK bonus which helps pay for future BLACK-cost cards
- More flexible than taking tokens alone
- L1_3 costs 5 tokens total (2W, 2B, 1R) - I'll need to accumulate these

Option 3: Reserve L1_3 AND take 2 BLACK tokens
- This is actually possible! Reserve gets me a gold, taking tokens gets me resources
- Total new tokens: +1 GOLD (from reserve) +2 BLACK = +3 tokens
- I currently have 1 token, so 1+3=4 total, well under 10

This is an efficient turn: I reserve L1_3 for the BLACK bonus and a gold token, while also taking 2 BLACK tokens toward my L1_32 purchase. This doubles my BLACK tokens while gaining the bonus and a gold for future flexibility.

Action: RESERVE_CARD L1_3, take 2 BLACK tokens
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_3, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 2: I need GREEN to complete L1_17 next turn. I'm taking GREEN, RED, and BLACK because RED appears in 9 cards on board (most common), and BLACK is crucial for Level 2 targets like L2_50 (BLUE bonus, 2 points, costs 1 WHITE + 1 RED + 4 BLACK with my future WHITE bonus). After this move I'll have 6 tokens: 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED, 2 BLACK. Next turn I purchase L1_17 (spending BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK), leaving me with 1 RED, 1 BLACK, and WHITE bonus - positioned to collect 3 more BLACK for L2_50. My opponent needs multiple turns to gather tokens for their reserved cards (L1_32 needs 4 BLACK, L1_3 needs 2 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 1 RED), giving me tempo advantage.

======================================================================================

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GLD=2}
Reasoning: I need to make progress toward my reserved cards. Looking at my situation:
- L1_32 costs BLACK 4 (I have 0 BLACK tokens)
- L1_3 costs WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1 (I have 0 tokens of these colors)

I currently have 2 GOLD tokens and no color bonuses. My optimal path is:
1. Take tokens to build toward purchasing a card
2. Consider reserving L1_5 (BLACK bonus) for another gold token and bonus

Token Analysis:
- Taking 3 different colors is valid (each bank has 2+ available)
- I should take BLACK tokens since both my reserved cards need BLACKs (L1_32 needs 4, L1_3 needs 1)
- Taking BLUE and GREEN gives me flexibility for L1_3 (needs BLUE 2) and L1_5 (needs GREEN 2)
- This avoids RED which only L1_3 needs (1 RED) and L1_36 requires (3 RED)

Decision: Take 1 BLACK, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN tokens. This gives me:
- 1 BLACK toward L1_32 (need 4 total) and L1_3 (need 1)
- 1 BLUE toward L1_3 (need 2) and future BLUE-cost cards
- 1 GREEN toward L1_5 (need 2)

I won't reserve L1_5 this turn because I already have 2 reserved cards and should focus on accumulating resources before reserving more. With only 2 tokens now, adding 3 more puts me at 5 total, well under the 10-token limit.

Final action: TAKE_TOKENS (1 BLACK, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN)
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 3: Executing my plan to purchase L1_17. I have exactly the required tokens: 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK (from my total of 6). This gives me my first WHITE bonus and reduces my tokens to 2 (1 RED, 1 BLACK remaining), maintaining efficiency. The WHITE bonus immediately makes several cards affordable: L1_39 (RED bonus) now costs only 2 WHITE, L1_36 (RED bonus) costs just 4 tokens total, and L2_50 (2 points, BLUE bonus) requires 6 tokens instead of 7. My opponent still needs multiple turns to gather tokens for their reserved cards - L1_32 requires 4 BLACK total, L1_3 needs 5 tokens across three colors. I'm maintaining tempo advantage. Next turn I can evaluate whether to quickly grab L1_39 for a second bonus (take 2 WHITE doubles since 4 available) or gather BLACK tokens toward higher-value cards like L2_50 or L1_36.

======================================================================================

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I need to analyze my current situation carefully:

**Current State:**
- Tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (total: 5)
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4, have 1), L1_3 (needs WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1, have 0)
- Bonuses: None yet

**Board Analysis:**
- BLACK tokens available: 2 (this is low and could run out!)
- Other tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3

**My Strategy Options:**
1. Take 2 BLACK tokens → Progress toward L1_32 (would have 3 BLACK, need 1 more)
2. Reserve L1_5 (BLACK bonus, cost 2G, 1R) + take 2 BLACK → Get BLACK bonus which helps pay for L1_32

**Decision:**
Taking 2 BLACK tokens is crucial because:
- L1_32 costs BLACK 4 total, I have 1 → need 3 more
- Only 2 BLACK available now; if opponent takes them, I'm blocked from completing L1_32
- Taking 2 keeps me at 7 tokens, well under 10

While reserving L1_5 is tempting for the BLACK bonus, I already have 2 reserved cards. The more urgent priority is securing the scarce BLACK tokens before they disappear. Once I have more BLACK tokens, I can focus on buying cards.

I'll take 2 BLACK tokens now. Next turn I can potentially reserve L1_5 if needed.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLACK tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I need to correct my action based on the board state. BLACK only has 2 tokens available, so I cannot take 2 of the same color (requires 4+). I must take 3 different colors instead.

Current tokens: 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 5 total
My reserved cards need:
- L1_32: BLACK 4 (I have 1 BLACK, need 3 more)
- L1_3: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1 (I have 0 WHITE, 0 RED, and 1 BLUE)

Since I can't take BLACK (only 2 available, need 4 to take 2), I should take WHITE, BLUE, and RED:
- WHITE: toward L1_3 (need 2)
- BLUE: toward L1_3 (need 2) and I already have 1
- RED: toward L1_3 (need 1)

This gives me 5 + 3 = 8 tokens total, well under the 10 limit. I avoid taking GREEN since I already have 1 and neither reserved card needs it.

Final action: TAKE_TOKENS (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED)
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 4: I have 2 tokens (1 RED, 1 BLACK) and a WHITE bonus. My opponent has 8 tokens and will likely purchase L1_3 next turn to get a BLACK bonus. I need to keep pace by securing my second bonus quickly. L1_9 (BLUE bonus) costs 1 WHITE + 1 GREEN + 1 RED + 1 BLACK, which with my WHITE bonus = 1 GREEN + 1 RED + 1 BLACK = 3 tokens. If I take WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK now, I'll have exactly the tokens needed to buy L1_9 next turn (1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 2 BLACK = 5 total). WHITE + BLUE bonuses position me for L2_54 (1 point, becomes 6 tokens with bonuses) and eventually nobles N6 (3 BLUE + 3 WHITE + 3 BLACK) or N3 (4 WHITE + 4 BLACK). This is faster than gathering 6 tokens for L2_50 without gaining bonuses. Taking these 3 tokens brings me to 5 total, well under the 10-token limit.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Let me analyze the current game state:

My current tokens: 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 8 total tokens

My reserved cards:
- L1_32: Needs BLACK 4 (have 1, need 3 more)
- L1_3: Needs WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1 (have 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED - I have ALL required tokens!)

This is excellent! I can purchase L1_3 right now:
- Cost: 2 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 1 RED = 5 tokens total
- My available: 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED = 4 tokens
- Gold can substitute for any color, so 2 GOLD covers the remaining 1 token

By purchasing L1_3, I get:
- A BLACK bonus (helps pay for BLACK-cost cards like L1_32 which needs 4 BLACK)
- 0 prestige points but unlocks token generation capabilities
- Reduces my reserved cards from 2 to 1

Alternative consideration: Reserving L1_5 (BLACK bonus, costs GREEN 2, RED 1)
- I have all required tokens: 1 GREEN, 1 RED + 2 GOLD
- But L1_5 costs GREEN 2, RED 1 = 3 tokens, I have 2 (1G, 1R)
- Would need 1 more token, so not immediately purchasable
- Also, L1_5 has no prestige points, while L1_3 gives me a BLACK bonus more efficiently

Decision: PURCHASE L1_3 now. This card gives me a BLACK bonus which helps pay for L1_32 (still need 3 more BLACKs), and I'm already at 8 tokens so I need to be careful about token limits anyway. This is a productive use of my turn that advances my position significantly.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have exactly the tokens needed to purchase L1_9 NOW: With my WHITE bonus, L1_9 costs 0 WHITE + 1 GREEN + 1 RED + 1 BLACK = 3 tokens, and I have 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 2 BLACK. Buying it immediately (instead of taking tokens then buying next turn as I originally planned) saves a turn and gets me the crucial BLUE bonus faster. After this purchase I'll have 1 WHITE + 1 BLACK remaining (2 tokens total). With WHITE + BLUE bonuses, my next targets are: (1) L1_39 (RED bonus) - costs only 2 WHITE after my bonus, I can take 2 WHITE doubles next turn to afford it, giving me 3 bonuses quickly, or (2) advance directly toward Level 2 point cards. The BLUE bonus reduces costs on valuable cards like L2_50 (2 points, BLUE bonus) and L2_54 (1 point, WHITE bonus). My opponent has only 3 tokens and can't purchase their reserved L1_32 (needs 3 BLACK but board only has 1 BLACK available), so I maintain tempo advantage. Purchasing L1_9 now is strictly better than taking tokens first.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Analyzing my current situation:
- I have 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 1 GOLD token (3 total)
- Reserved: L1_32 (GREEN bonus, 1 prestige point, costs BLACK 4)
- I have 1 BLACK bonus from L1_3
- Board BLACK tokens: only 2 available (can't take 2 of same color)

My options:
1. Reserve L1_5 (BLACK bonus, costs GREEN 2, RED 1) + take tokens
2. Take 3 different tokens toward L1_32
3. Reserve from deck

Looking at L1_5: costs GREEN 2, RED 1. I have 1 GREEN already. If I reserve it, I get a gold token, and then I could use my 3 tokens (1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 1 GOLD) plus gold to potentially purchase it!

But wait - I have 1 GOLD. L1_5 costs GREEN 2, RED 1 = 3 tokens. I have 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 1 GOLD. That's 2 tokens toward it. Not enough.

Actually, I can only take MAXIMUM 3 tokens per turn. Since I reserved L1_5, I can take at most 3 tokens. And I can't exceed 10 total.

Strategy adjustment: I'll reserve L1_5 for the BLACK bonus and gold token. Then I'll take 3 GREEN tokens. Why GREEN?
- I need GREEN 2 for L1_5 (I have 1, taking 3 gives me 4 total)
- GREEN also helps with L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 point, costs GREEN 4)
- BLACK has only 2 available, so I can't take 2 BLACKs anyway
- Taking GREEN is versatile for multiple future purchases

After this: 1 GREEN + 3 GREEN = 4 GREEN total, plus 1 BLACK, 1 GOLD (from reserve). Then next turn I can take 3 more GREEN (or RED) to finish L1_5.

Final plan: RESERVE L1_5, take 3 GREEN tokens. This gives me a BLACK bonus, gold token, and progresses toward L1_5 purchase.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 2 tokens (1 WHITE, 1 BLACK) and WHITE + BLUE bonuses. My opponent is about to purchase their reserved L1_32 (1 point, GREEN bonus) which gives them a 1-0 lead, as they have exactly what they need: 1 BLACK token + 1 BLACK bonus + 2 GOLD tokens to cover the 4 BLACK cost. My fastest path to catch up is securing a third bonus (RED) by purchasing L1_39 next turn. L1_39 costs 3 WHITE, but with my WHITE bonus needs only 2 WHITE tokens. Taking WHITE, BLUE, RED now gives me exactly 2 WHITE next turn to buy L1_39. The BLUE token supports future Level 2 plays (I already have 1 BLUE bonus), and RED is the most abundant color on board (4 available). With WHITE + BLUE + RED bonuses, Level 2 cards become highly affordable: L2_54 drops to just 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 2 RED, meaning after buying L1_39 I'd only need 1 WHITE + 1 BLUE + 1 RED more to purchase it for my first point. This path gets me to 1 point by turn 9 while maintaining a stronger 3-bonus engine than my opponent's 2-bonus setup, positioning me well for nobles N6 (3 BLUE + 3 WHITE + 3 BLACK) or N3 (4 WHITE + 4 BLACK) later.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I need to analyze my current situation:

Current tokens: 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 4 total
Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4, gives GREEN bonus, 1 prestige) and L1_5 (needs GREEN 2, RED 1, gives BLACK bonus)
Bonuses: 1 BLACK from L1_3

Looking at purchasing options:
- L1_32: Needs 4 BLACK, I have 1. With my BLACK bonus, I need 2 more BLACK. Board has only 2 BLACK available, can't take 2 of same color (need 4+).
- L1_5: Needs GREEN 2, RED 1. I have 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 2 GOLD. I could use gold to substitute, but I'd need more tokens.

Token collection strategy:
I need to accumulate resources efficiently. For L1_5, I need 1 more GREEN and 1 RED. Taking these specific tokens gets me closer to purchasing L1_5.

After taking 1 GREEN and 1 RED: I'll have 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 6 tokens
Then next turn I could take 1 WHITE (or reserve/purchase) to maintain flexibility.

However, I should also consider reserving a card. L1_5 costs GREEN 2, RED 1 = 3 tokens. I have 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 2 GOLD = 4 tokens. Using gold as substitute, I could almost purchase it!

Taking tokens is more versatile right now. With 4 tokens, taking 2 more (GREEN and RED) puts me at 6 total. This advances me toward L1_5 while keeping options open.

- Board shows GREEN: 3 available (can't take 2 same color, need 4+)

I need 1 GREEN and 1 RED more to purchase L1_5. Since I can't take 2 of same color (only 3 GREEN available, need 4+), I'll take 3 different colors.

Taking GREEN, RED, and BLUE gives me:
- 1 GREEN toward L1_5 (need 1 more, have 1 already = 2 total)
- 1 RED toward L1_5 (need 1, have 0 = 1 total)
- 1 BLUE as flexible resource
- After: 4 + 3 = 7 tokens total, well under 10

I won't reserve L1_5 because it's already in my reserved hand. I need to take tokens to accumulate what I need for purchase.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L1_39 (RED bonus) right now! It costs 3 WHITE, but with my WHITE bonus it's reduced to 2 WHITE, and I have exactly 2 WHITE tokens. This completes the plan I set in motion last turn. Buying L1_39 gives me my 3rd bonus (WHITE+BLUE+RED), which dramatically improves my efficiency on Level 2 point cards. Most importantly, L2_54 (1 point, WHITE bonus) drops from needing 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 3 RED to just 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 2 RED = 5 tokens with the added RED bonus. After this purchase I'll have 3 tokens (1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK) remaining. Next turn I can take WHITE, BLUE, RED to reach 6 tokens, then purchase L2_54 on turn 9 for my first point. My opponent will likely buy L1_32 next turn (they have 1 BLACK token + 1 BLACK bonus + 2 GOLD = exactly 4 BLACK equivalent) to score 1 point and gain a GREEN bonus, putting them at 2 bonuses vs my 3. However, my triple-bonus engine positions me better for the mid-game scoring race. I verified that taking tokens instead doesn't accelerate my path - I cannot reach L2_54 in 2 turns without the RED bonus due to the board only having 2 RED tokens available (can't double-take RED). Buying L1_39 now is the most efficient move.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current situation:

**My Status:**
- Tokens: 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 4 total
- Reserved cards: L1_32 (BLACK 4), L1_5 (GREEN 2, RED 1)
- Bonuses: BLACK 1 (from L1_3)

**What I need:**
- L1_5: Needs 1 more GREEN, 1 more RED (currently have 1 GREEN, 0 RED)
- L1_32: Needs 4 BLACK (currently have 1)

**Board tokens:**
- All colors have 2 available, so I can only take 3 different colors (1 each), not 2 of same color (would need 4+)

**My decision:**
I should take GREEN, RED, and BLUE tokens:
- 1 GREEN: Completes L1_5 requirement (had 1, now 2 total)
- 1 RED: Completes L1_5 requirement (had 0, now 1 total)
- 1 BLUE: Flexible resource for future purchases

After this: 4 + 3 = 7 tokens total, well under the 10 limit. Next turn I can either purchase L1_5 (using my 2 GOLD as wildcards) or continue building toward L1_32.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 3 tokens (1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK) and 3 bonuses (WHITE, BLUE, RED). My opponent is at 10 tokens and will purchase L1_32 next turn to score their first point and gain a GREEN bonus. To keep pace, I'm executing my plan to buy L2_54 (1 point, WHITE bonus) on turn 9. L2_54 costs 2 WHITE + 3 BLUE + 3 RED, which with my bonuses reduces to 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 2 RED = 5 tokens needed. Taking WHITE, BLUE, RED now gives me exactly 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 2 RED (plus 1 BLACK) = 6 tokens next turn, allowing me to purchase L2_54 for my first point. I verified board availability: 4 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED all available. After buying L2_54, I'll have 4 bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED) vs opponent's likely 2 bonuses (BLACK, GREEN), positioning me better for high-value cards. This move brings me to 6 tokens total, well under the 10-token limit, and is the fastest path to scoring my first point.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current situation:

**My Status:**
- Tokens: 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 4 total
- Reserved cards: L1_32 (BLACK 4), L1_5 (GREEN 2, RED 1)
- Bonuses: BLACK 1 (from L1_3)
- Score: 0

**What I need:**
- L1_5: Needs GREEN 2, RED 1. I have 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 2 GOLD. I need 1 more GREEN and 1 RED.
- L1_32: Needs BLACK 4. I have 1 BLACK, need 3 more.

**Board token availability:**
- WHITE: 3, BLUE: 0, GREEN: 1, RED: 0, BLACK: 2, GOLD: 3

Since BLUE=0 and RED=0, I cannot take those colors. The maximum I can take is 4 tokens (WHITE, GREEN, BLACK, GOLD), but I can only take valid combinations.

I need RED for L1_5, but RED has 0 tokens on the board. My options:
1. Reserve a card from the board that gives RED bonus (L1_36 = RED bonus)
2. Take tokens and hope to draw RED later from deck

Option 1 is much better! L1_36 gives me:
- A RED bonus (exactly what I need for L1_5)
- A gold token (free!)
- Then next turn I can take 1 RED (from new face-up card or deck) and purchase L1_5

By reserving L1_36 from the board (face-up cards), I get:
- card_id: "L1_36"
- A RED bonus for future purchases
- 1 gold token
- Keep my 4 existing tokens

This is the most efficient path to purchasing L1_5 next turn.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_36, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: I need to analyze my current situation carefully after my illegal move.

**My Status:**
- Current tokens: 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 4 total
- Reserved cards: L1_32 (BLACK 4, 1 prestige point), L1_5 (GREEN 2, RED 1)
- Bonuses: BLACK 1 (from L1_3)

**Board Token Availability:**
- WHITE: 3 available
- BLUE: 0 available (not usable!)
- GREEN: 1 available
- RED: 0 available (not usable!)
- BLACK: 2 available
- GOLD: 3 available

**Critical Problem:**
- BLUE and RED have 0 tokens available, so I CANNOT take them
- I can only take from WHITE, GREEN, BLACK, GOLD

**My Strategy:**
Since I can't take BLUE or RED (both 0 on board), I cannot immediately purchase L1_5 which needs RED. I need to adjust my strategy.

Looking at face-up Level 1 cards, I see L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 prestige point, costs GREEN 4). This is valuable because:
- It gives 1 prestige point toward my goal of 15
- WHITE bonus helps pay for WHITE-cost cards
- I already have 2 GREEN, so I'm halfway there

My plan:
1. Reserve L1_24 from the board to get a gold token
2. Take 3 WHITE tokens (most available on board, flexible resource)
3. After: 4 current + 1 gold (from reserve) + 3 WHITE = 8 tokens total (under 10 limit)

This gives me:
- A prestige point source (L1_24)
- WHITE bonus to help with future WHITE-cost cards
- Flexible WHITE tokens for multiple potential purchases
- Progress toward my goal of 15 prestige points

I avoid taking GREEN (only 1 available) since I already have 2 toward L1_24 anyway, and taking 2 of same color requires 4+ available which isn't the case here.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_24, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: CRITICAL ERROR: I'm at 10 tokens! Cannot take any tokens without returning.

**Current State:** 10 tokens (WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 1, GOLD 2)
**Reserved:** L1_32 (BLACK 4), L1_5 (GREEN 2, RED 1)
**Purchased:** L1_3 (BLACK 1 bonus)

**Options at 10 tokens:**
1. PURCHASE L1_5 - Costs GREEN 2, RED 1 = 3 tokens
   - I have GREEN 3, RED 2
   - After purchase: 7 tokens left (GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2, BLUE 2)
   - Gets another BLACK bonus (now BLACK 2 total)
   
2. RESERVE a card - Would need to return 1 token to get the gold
   - Takes up a reserved slot (already have 2)
   - Less efficient than purchasing

**Decision:** PURCHASE L1_5 immediately!
- It's affordable with my current tokens
- Gives me another BLACK bonus (helpful for L1_32 which needs 4 BLACK)
- Reduces my token count from 10 to 7, freeing up space
- No prestige but builds my token-generation engine

After this: I'll have GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 (from L1_3) + new BLACK from L1_5 = BLACK 2, GOLD 2, BLUE 2. Next turn I'll need to accumulate more BLACK tokens for L1_32 (need 3 more).

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens (1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 RED, 1 BLACK) and 3 bonuses (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED). This is Turn 9, exactly when I planned to purchase L2_54. L2_54 costs 2 WHITE + 3 BLUE + 3 RED, which with my bonuses reduces to 1 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 2 RED = 5 tokens needed. I have EXACTLY these tokens available. Purchasing L2_54 now scores my first point (1-0 lead) and gives me a 2nd WHITE bonus, bringing me to 2 WHITE + 1 BLUE + 1 RED bonuses total. My opponent will likely purchase their reserved L1_32 next turn (they have 1 BLACK + 2 BLACK bonuses + 2 GOLD = 5 BLACK equivalent for the 4 BLACK cost), tying the score at 1-1 and giving them GREEN bonus. However, my 4-bonus engine is superior. With 2 WHITE bonuses, high-value Level 2 cards become very affordable: L2_50 (2 points, BLUE bonus) needs only 4 BLACK tokens with my bonuses, and L2_55 (2 points) needs just 1 GREEN + 2 RED + 2 BLACK = 5 tokens. I verified alternatives: taking tokens delays my first point by a full turn for no strategic gain, and no other point-scoring cards are currently affordable. After this purchase I'll have 1 BLACK token remaining and can accumulate tokens for my next 2-point card. This executes my strategy perfectly.

======================================================================================

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current situation:

**My Status:**
- Tokens: 0 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD = 7 total
- Reserved: L1_32 (BLACK 4 cost, GREEN bonus, 1 prestige point)
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK bonus), L1_5 (BLACK bonus)
- Bonuses: BLACK 2
- Score: 0 prestige points

**What I need for L1_32:**
- Cost: BLACK 4
- With BLACK 2 bonus: need 2 BLACK tokens actual
- I have 1 BLACK token, so need 1 more BLACK token

**My decision:**
I'll take 2 BLACK tokens. This is optimal because:
1. I need exactly 1 more BLACK token to purchase L1_32
2. BLACK tokens are scarce (only 2 available on board)
3. Taking 2 of same color is only allowed when 4+ available, and BLACK has exactly 2
4. After this: 7 + 2 = 9 tokens, under the 10 limit
5. Next turn I can purchase L1_32 (cost 4 BLACK - 2 bonus = 2 BLACK needed, I'll have 3 BLACK tokens)

Taking 3 different tokens (e.g., BLACK, GREEN, BLUE) would give me more variety but leave me still needing BLACK tokens. Taking 2 BLACK now is more efficient.

**Alternative consideration:**
L1_24 costs GREEN 4 for WHITE bonus + 1 prestige. I only have 1 GREEN, so not immediately accessible.
L1_26 costs WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 2. I could purchase it now, but it has no prestige and gives GREEN bonus which doesn't help my immediate goals.

The 2 BLACK tokens approach is best - it moves me directly toward purchasing L1_32 and scoring my first prestige point.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLACK tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current situation:

**My Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK bonus), L1_5 (BLACK bonus)
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4, gives GREEN bonus + 1 prestige)
- Bonuses: BLACK 2

**My Goal:** Need 3 more BLACK tokens to purchase L1_32 (I have BLACK 1 bonus, need 4 total)

**Board Analysis:**
- BLACK tokens: 2 available (can't take 2 of same color, need 4+)
- All other colors have 3-4 available

**Decision:** Take 3 different tokens (WHITE, GREEN, BLACK)

Why this combination:
- 1 BLACK: Essential for L1_32 purchase (need 3 more total)
- 1 GREEN: L1_32 also gives me a GREEN bonus, so I'm building toward that
- 1 WHITE: L1_24 (face-up) costs GREEN 4 and gives WHITE bonus with 1 prestige; I already have 1 GREEN, this helps toward that goal

After this: 7 + 3 = 10 tokens total, which is at the limit but acceptable since I'm making progress toward purchasing L1_32. Next turn I could take more BLACK tokens (if available) or continue building toward a prestige card.

I won't reserve because I already have 2 reserved cards, and I have plenty of tokens to work with.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 1 BLACK token and 4 bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED). My opponent will purchase L1_32 next turn to score 1 point and gain GREEN bonus, tying us 1-1. After that, they'll have ~6 tokens and 3 bonuses (2 BLACK, 1 GREEN). Critically, L2_50 (2 points, BLUE bonus) costs only 2 WHITE + 1 RED + 2 BLACK after opponent's bonuses - just 5 tokens needed - and they already have 1 WHITE + 1 RED available, meaning they can accumulate the missing 1 WHITE + 2 BLACK in just 2 turns and purchase L2_50 before me. If I don't reserve L2_50 now, opponent will buy it and jump to 3 points by turn 13-14. By reserving L2_50 this turn, I: (1) deny opponent their fastest 2-point path, forcing them toward slower options like L2_55 which needs 4 RED (3 turns to accumulate), (2) get a GOLD token (board has 3 available), giving me 1 BLACK + 1 GOLD = 2 tokens total, (3) secure a 2-point card that costs only 4 BLACK after my bonuses. With 1 GOLD substituting for 1 BLACK, I need only 3 BLACK tokens. After opponent's turn, board will have 3 BLACK (they return 2 when buying L1_32). I can take BLACK + 2 others on turns 11 and 12 to reach 3 BLACK + 1 GOLD, then purchase L2_50 on turn 13 for 2 points and a 2nd BLUE bonus, reaching 3 points total. This defensive reservation prevents opponent from racing ahead while securing my own scoring path.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **My Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2 = 8 total
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK bonus), L1_5 (BLACK bonus)
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4, gives GREEN bonus + 1 prestige)
- Bonuses: BLACK 2

**My Goal:** Need 2 more BLACK tokens to purchase L1_32 (my BLACK 2 bonus reduces the 4 BLACK cost to 2)

**Board Analysis:**
- BLACK tokens: 1 available (can't take 2 of same color, need 4+)
- All colors have 2-3 available, so I can only take 3 different colors (1 each)

**Decision:** Take WHITE, BLACK, GREEN tokens
- 1 BLACK: Essential for L1_32 (need 2 more, after this I'll need just 1 more)
- 1 WHITE: Builds toward Level 2 cards that often require WHITE
- 1 GREEN: Supports my future L1_24 goal (costs GREEN 4, gives WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)

After this: 8 + 3 = 11 tokens → wait, that exceeds 10! Let me reconsider.

Actually with 8 current tokens and taking 3 more, I'd have 11. I need to return 1 token.

Better approach: Since I have 8 tokens and taking 3 would exceed 10, I should take only 2 tokens (returning 1 from my 8). But the most efficient move is to:

1. Take 2 tokens (since I have 8, taking 2 gives 10 exactly, no return needed)
2. OR return 1 token when taking 3

Given the flexibility of WHITE, BLACK, GREEN for my goals, I'll take these 3 colors and return 1 BLUE token (since BLUE is least critical for my current objectives). This gets me to 10 tokens with optimal color distribution for purchasing L1_32 next turn.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Current Situation Analysis:**

I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2) - I cannot take any more tokens without returning some first.

**My Status:**
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK bonus), L1_5 (BLACK bonus)  
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4, gives GREEN bonus + 1 prestige)
- Bonuses: BLACK 2

**Options at 10 tokens:**
1. **PURCHASE** - Must use tokens to buy a card and reduce count
2. **RESERVE** - Get a gold token, but must return 1 token to stay under limit

**Can I afford any purchases?**
- L1_24: Needs GREEN 4 - I have 2, CANNOT afford
- L1_36: Needs WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3 - I have all, CAN afford! But this gives no prestige points
- L1_32 (reserved): Needs BLACK 4 - I have BLACK 2 in bonuses, but only BLACK 2 tokens, CANNOT afford yet

**Strategic Decision:** RESERVE L1_24

Why reserve over purchasing L1_36?
- L1_24 gives 1 prestige point (valuable toward the 15-point goal)
- I need GREEN 4 for it, and GREEN is available on the board
- By reserving, I get a gold token which helps with future purchases
- I'll return 1 WHITE token to make room for the gold

**After this action:** 10 tokens → return 1 WHITE + gain 1 GOLD = still 10 tokens, but now I have L1_24 reserved for future purchase with GOLD flexibility.

This positions me to take GREEN tokens next turn and work toward purchasing L1_24 for its prestige point.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I need 4 BLACK tokens to buy my reserved L2_50 (2 points, BLUE bonus). Currently have 1 BLACK + 1 GOLD = 2 BLACK equivalent. Taking BLACK + WHITE + RED gives me 2 BLACK + 1 GOLD = 3 BLACK equivalent, putting me one turn away from buying L2_50. Next turn I take tokens including BLACK to reach 4 BLACK equivalent, then purchase L2_50 on Turn 15 for 2 points (total 3). Opponent will buy L1_32 next turn (1 point, GREEN bonus), then likely target L2_55 (2 points, needs 4 RED with their bonuses) to reach 3 points. However, after buying L2_50 I'll have 2 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 1 RED bonuses, giving me a huge advantage on Level 3 cards: L3_78 (5 points) costs only 6 tokens for me vs 10 for opponent. Taking tokens now executes my fastest path to 3 points while positioning for dominance on high-value cards. Board has 1 BLACK, 4 WHITE, 3 RED available - all legal. After taking I'll have 5 tokens total, no returns needed.

Reasoning: CRITICAL SITUATION: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 3). I must take action to reduce my token count.

**My Options:**
1. PURCHASE L1_33 - Costs WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1 = 4 tokens
2. PURCHASE L1_36 - Costs WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3 = 5 tokens
3. RESERVE a card - Would gain 1 GOLD but need to return 2 tokens to stay under 10

**Why L1_33 is optimal:**
- It costs only 4 tokens (WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1) - I have all of them
- After purchase: 10 - 4 = 6 tokens remaining
- Gives me RED bonus (expanding my bonus diversity)
- Scores 1 prestige point (toward 15 goal)
- My BLACK 2 bonus reduces the BLACK cost to 0 effectively

**Alternative consideration:** L1_36 costs 5 tokens but gives RED bonus too. L1_33 is more efficient (4 tokens for same result).

**My Strategic Position:**
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK), L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED) = BLACK 2 bonus
- Reserved: L1_32 (BLACK 4 cost, GREEN bonus + 1 prestige), L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Score: 1 prestige point after this purchase

This move frees up 4 tokens and gets me closer to the 15-point goal while maintaining flexibility for future purchases.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens (1W, 1R, 2BL, 1GO) and need 4 BLACK equivalent to buy my reserved L2_50 (2 points). Currently I have 2BL + 1GO = 3 BLACK equivalent, 1 short. The board has 0 BLACK tokens available, so I cannot take BLACK directly. However, I can reserve L3_78 to gain a 2nd GOLD token, giving me 2BL + 2GO = 4 BLACK equivalent to purchase L2_50 next turn. L3_78 (5 points, BLUE bonus) is also my optimal endgame card - after buying L2_50 I'll have 2W + 2B + 1R bonuses, making L3_78 cost only 5W + 1B = 6 tokens vs 10 for my opponent. My opponent will buy L1_32 next turn (1 point, GREEN bonus) with their 2BL + 2GO, tying us 1-1. But I purchase L2_50 on Turn 13 to jump to 3-1, then accumulate tokens for my secured 5-point L3_78. Reserving L3_78 now secures both my immediate scoring path (via GOLD token) and my best endgame card, while opponent's fastest 2-point option is L2_55 which needs 3+ more RED tokens (multiple turns). This is the optimal move.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current situation:

**My Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK), L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED) = BLACK 2, RED 1 bonuses
- Reserved: L1_32 (BLACK 4 cost, GREEN bonus + 1 prestige), L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Score: 0 prestige points

**Board Constraints:**
- BLACK tokens: 0 available (cannot take)
- All other colors: 2-3 available

**My Strategic Analysis:**

My reserved cards require specific tokens:
1. L1_24: Needs GREEN 4 (I have 1, need 3 more)
2. L1_32: Needs BLACK 4, but with BLACK 2 bonus I need 2 BLACK tokens - but 0 available on board!

**Best Move: Take GREEN, BLUE, WHITE tokens**

Why this combination:
- 1 GREEN: Gets me to GREEN 2/4 toward L1_24
- 1 BLUE: Gets me to BLUE 2, which with my RED 1 and BLACK 2 bonus would allow me to purchase L1_19 next turn (BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 1 cost, where BLACK 1 - BLACK 2 bonus = 0)
- 1 WHITE: I have 0 WHITE, need it for flexibility and some face-up cards

After this: 7 + 3 = 10 tokens total

**Next Turn:** I can purchase L1_19 which costs BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 1. With BLACK 2 bonus, BLACK cost is 0, so I only need BLUE 2 and GREEN 2 which I'll have. This gives WHITE bonus + 0 prestige.

Taking these tokens builds toward my L1_24 goal while positioning for an immediate purchase next turn.

======================================================================================

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I have exactly the resources needed to purchase my reserved L2_50 NOW. L2_50 costs 2 WHITE + 1 RED + 4 BLACK, which with my bonuses (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED) reduces to 0 WHITE + 0 RED + 4 BLACK = 4 BLACK tokens needed. I currently have 2 BLACK tokens + 2 GOLD tokens = 4 BLACK equivalent. Purchasing L2_50 this turn: (1) scores 2 points immediately (total: 3 points), (2) gives me a 2nd BLUE bonus (total bonuses: 2W, 2B, 1R), (3) establishes a commanding 3-0 lead before opponent can score. My opponent will purchase L1_32 next turn with their 2BL+2BLACK bonuses+2GOLD to reach 1 point, leaving me at 3-1. After buying L2_50, my reserved L3_78 (5 points, BLUE bonus) costs only 5 WHITE + 1 BLUE = 6 tokens with my upgraded bonuses, making it highly affordable. With 2 tokens remaining after this purchase, I can accumulate the 6 tokens needed for L3_78 in 2-3 turns to reach 8 points total. This is Turn 13, exactly when I planned to execute this purchase per my previous reasoning. Purchasing L2_50 now is the optimal move - it scores points immediately, strengthens my engine, and positions me perfectly for my 5-point endgame card.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2). I need to take action to reduce my token count and make progress toward my goals.

**Analysis of Options:**

1. **PURCHASE L1_36** (WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3):
   - With my BLACK 2 bonus, the BLACK cost is reduced to 1 (3-2=1)
   - Total cost: WHITE 1 + RED 1 + BLACK 1 = 3 tokens
   - I have all required tokens
   - Gives RED bonus (no prestige)
   - After purchase: 10 - 3 = 7 tokens remaining

2. **PURCHASE L1_33** (WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1):
   - Already purchased this card, so not an option

3. **PURCHASE L1_24** (GREEN 4):
   - Need GREEN 4, I have only 2 - CANNOT afford

**Decision: PURCHASE L1_36**

This is the best move because:
- It's affordable with my current tokens
- Reduces my token count from 10 to 7
- Gives me another RED bonus (good for nobles like N2 which requires GREEN 4, RED 4)
- Uses my BLACK 2 bonus efficiently (reduces cost from 3 to 1)

**Strategic Position After This:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 0, BLACK 1, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Bonuses: BLACK 2, RED 2
- Still can reserve/purchase L1_24 (need 2 more GREEN)
- Still can purchase L1_32 (need 2 more BLACK tokens, have 1 bonus)

Next turn I can take GREEN, GREEN, GREEN to work toward L1_24 or take BLACK, BLACK to work toward L1_32 depending on token availability.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 3 points with a commanding lead (opponent at 0 points). My reserved L3_78 (5 points) costs 7W+3B, which with my bonuses (2W, 2B, 1R) reduces to 5W+1B needed. I currently have 1W+1R=2 tokens. Optimal path to victory: Turn 14 take WHITE+BLUE+GREEN (gives 2W,1B,1G,1R = 5 tokens), Turn 15 take WHITE+RED+BLACK after opponent buys L1_32 (reaches 3W,1B,1G,2R,1BL = 8 tokens), Turn 16 take 2 GOLD when 4 GOLD available on board (reaches 3W,1B,1G,2R,1BL,2GO = 9 tokens), Turn 17 purchase L3_78 using 3W+2GO+1B to reach 8 points total. Opponent likely scores 1 point turn 14 (L1_32) and 1 point turn 16 (L1_24), leaving me with 8-2 lead. No face-up cards affordable now: L1_25 needs 1BL (I have 0), L1_26 needs 2BL (have 0), L1_19 needs 2G+1BL (have 0G,0BL), L1_28 needs 1B+1G (have 0B,0G), all Level 2+ cards need 3+ tokens I lack. Reserving another card wastes a turn without scoring acceleration. Board has 3W, 2B, 2G available confirming this legal take. This executes my fastest path to 8 points.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 7 tokens and need to make progress toward my goals. Let me analyze:

**My Status:**
- Bonuses: BLACK 2, RED 2
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4 → with bonus, need 2 more BLACK), L1_24 (needs GREEN 4)
- I can afford L1_19 RIGHT NOW:
  - Cost: BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 1
  - With BLACK 2 bonus: BLACK cost reduces to 0
  - I have BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 1 → fully affordable!
  
**Why purchase L1_19:**
- Gets me a WHITE bonus (new color, increasing flexibility)
- Reduces tokens from 7 to 3
- Positions me to take GREEN tokens next turn toward L1_24
- Uses my tokens efficiently rather than hoarding them

**Why not take tokens:**
- At 7 tokens, taking 3 would hit the limit of 10
- I have an affordable purchase available now
- The WHITE bonus from L1_19 will help me qualify for nobles like N6 (WHITE 3)

After this, I'll have 3 tokens and can take 3 GREEN tokens to progress toward L1_24 (my reserved prestige card).

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 3 points with 5 tokens (2W,1B,1G,1R). My reserved L3_78 costs 5W+1B after bonuses (2W,2B,1R). Taking WHITE+BLUE+GREEN gives me 3W+2B+2G+1R (8 tokens). Turn 16: take WHITE+BLACK+RED to reach 4W+2B+2G+2R+1BL (10 tokens). Turn 17: reserve any Level 2 card to get GOLD token (board has 3 available), giving me 4W+1GO+2B = 5W equivalent + 2B. Then immediately purchase L3_78 using 4W+1GO+1B, reaching 8 points total. This executes my fastest path to 8 points by Turn 17. Opponent will buy L1_32 next turn (1 point) then L2_55 (2 points, needs just 1 more RED) by Turn 17 to reach 3 points total. My 8-3 lead is commanding. Reserving L2_55 to block opponent would delay my scoring by 1 turn without significantly slowing opponent (they'd pivot to L3_72 or L2_44). Taking tokens now is optimal - I verified board has WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 available and I won't exceed 10 tokens (8 total after taking).

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 4 tokens (WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2) and need to take action. My goal is to acquire L1_28 which costs GREEN 3, BLUE 2, WHITE 0 = 5 tokens total (with my WHITE 1 bonus). To get 3 GREEN tokens, I need to reserve L2_55 first to stay under 10 tokens.

**Why reserve L2_55:**
- Gives me WHITE bonus + 2 prestige points
- My WHITE 1 bonus helps qualify for nobles like N6 (WHITE 3) and N3 (WHITE 4)
- Cost is GREEN 1, RED 4, BLACK 2 - I'll need more GREEN and RED tokens anyway

**Token Management:**
- Current: 4 tokens
- Reserve L2_55: +1 GOLD = 5 tokens
- Taking 3 GREEN tokens would hit 8 tokens, but I must return 2 tokens first to stay under 10
- Actually, reserve adds 1 token (for free) = 5, so I can take 3 GREEN to get 8 tokens (5+3=8), which is fine

**Correction:** Wait, reserve adds 1 token, so 4+3=7, plus 1 from reserve = 8 tokens total, which is under 10. But if I take tokens before reserving, I get to 7 tokens, then reserve adds 1 = 8 tokens total.

Actually, the turn sequence matters. Let me reconsider:
- Take 3 GREEN tokens: 4+3=7 tokens
- Reserve L2_55: get 1 GOLD = 8 tokens total

That's under 10, so I can do both in one turn! But wait, I need to return tokens if taking tokens would exceed 10. 4+3=7 < 10, so no return needed for taking tokens.

**Final Strategy:**
- Take 3 GREEN tokens (for L1_28 progress)
- Return 2 tokens to stay lean (WHITE and BLUE, which I have 0 of anyway)
- This gives me 5 tokens total (3+2 returned)

Wait, that's not right either. If I take 3 GREEN from 4 tokens = 7 tokens. I need to return if it exceeds 10. 7 < 10, so no return needed. But then I can't reserve because reserve adds 1 = 8 tokens total.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking. The limit is 10 tokens total at end of turn. 4 + 3 = 7 < 10, so I can take 3 GREEN. But if I also reserve, that's 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 < 10, so I can do both!

Wait no, that's wrong. The sequence is: take tokens, then reserve (or vice versa). Each action happens sequentially.

If I take 3 GREEN: 4+3=7 tokens
If I then reserve: +1 GOLD = 8 tokens total

That's under 10! So I can take 3 GREEN and reserve L2_55 in the same turn, ending with 8 tokens.

Actually, I realize the constraint: if I take 3 GREEN tokens, I go to 7 tokens. Then if I reserve, I get +1 = 8 tokens total. That's fine.

But actually, I think the issue is: if I take tokens first (4+3=7), then reserve (+1=8), I have 8 tokens which is fine. No return needed.

But I also need to consider my future plans. To get L1_28, I need 3 GREEN, 2 BLUE. Taking 3 GREEN now is perfect for this goal.

Actually, I think the simplest approach is: TAKE 3 GREEN tokens now. End with 7 tokens (4+3). Next turn, I can reserve L2_55 (gets to 8) or purchase something.

But I want to reserve L2_55 for the WHITE bonus. So:
- Take 3 GREEN: 4+3=7
- Reserve L2_55: +1 = 8 tokens

That's 8 tokens, under 10. Perfect! I can do both in one turn.

Actually, I just realized the rules: you can take tokens OR reserve a card, not both. So I need to choose one action per turn.

**Decision: Take 3 GREEN tokens (not reserve)**

Why not reserve L2_55 now?
- If I reserve L2_55 now: 4+1=5 tokens
- Then I can only take 3 tokens next turn (5+3=8 < 10)
- Total progress: 3 GREEN tokens

If I take 3 GREEN now: 4+3=7 tokens
- Then I can reserve L2_55 next turn: 7+1=8 tokens
- Total progress: 3 GREEN tokens + reserve L2_55

Same total progress, but taking 3 GREEN now gets me closer to L1_28 immediately.

Also, I want to save my reserving for cards that give prestige points (like L1_24 gives 1 prestige). L2_55 gives 2 prestige, which is good, but I need GREEN tokens for L1_28.

**Final Decision: Take 3 GREEN tokens**

This moves me toward L1_28 while keeping my options open for next turn.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=3}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: **Current Situation Analysis:**

I'm at 4 tokens (RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2). My bonuses are WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 2. I have two reserved cards:
- L1_32: Costs BLACK 4 (need 2 more BLACK tokens with bonus)
- L1_24: Costs GREEN 4 (need 4 GREEN tokens)

**Board Token Availability:**
- WHITE: 1, BLUE: 2, GREEN: 2, RED: 2, BLACK: 3, GOLD: 3

**My Options:**

1. **PURCHASE L1_32** - I have only 1 BLACK token, need 2 more. CANNOT afford.
2. **PURCHASE L1_24** - I have 0 GREEN tokens, need 4. CANNOT afford.
3. **TAKE TOKENS** - Best move is to take 3 GREEN tokens

**Why take 3 GREEN tokens:**
- L1_24 requires GREEN 4, which gives 1 prestige point
- GREEN tokens on board: 2 available, so I can take all 2 now
- After taking 3 GREEN tokens (only 2 available), I'll have GREEN 2 tokens
- This gets me halfway to purchasing L1_24 for its prestige point
- After this: 4 + 3 = 7 tokens, under the 10 limit

**Next turn:** I'll have GREEN 2, can take 2 more GREEN tokens to reach GREEN 4, then purchase L1_24 for 1 prestige point.

**Strategic Value:** L1_24 gives 1 prestige point toward the 15-point goal, and its WHITE bonus will help qualify for nobles like N6 (WHITE 3, BLUE 3, BLACK 3).
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=3}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: **My Current Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2 = 4 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4, gives WHITE bonus + 1 prestige), L1_32 (needs BLACK 4 → need 2 BLACK tokens with bonus)
- Score: 0 prestige points

**Board Availability:** WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 3

**Strategic Analysis:**

My PRIMARY goal is L1_24 which gives 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus. I need 4 GREEN tokens.

Taking WHITE, GREEN, and RED tokens:
- 1 WHITE: Gets me to WHITE 1/1 for L1_20, which I could potentially buy next turn (cost: WHITE 3, BLUE 1, BLACK 1 - with WHITE 1 bonus, would need WHITE 2, BLUE 1, BLACK 1)
- 1 GREEN: Gets me to GREEN 1/4 toward L1_24
- 1 RED: Gets me to RED 2/1 for L1_20, plus I already have RED 2 bonus

After this action: 4 + 3 = 7 tokens total

**Why not take GREEN, GREEN, GREEN?**
- With only 2 GREEN available on board, I can only take 2 GREEN tokens, not 3
- Taking WHITE + GREEN + GREEN is less balanced than WHITE + GREEN + RED

**Why not purchase a card?**
- I can't afford any reserved cards (need 4 GREEN or 2 BLACK)
- Face-up cards are either too expensive or would use tokens inefficiently

Taking these 3 tokens is the most efficient path toward my reserved L1_24 while maintaining flexibility for future purchases.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.. Skipping turn.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 3 points with 8 tokens (3W, 2B, 2G, 1R). My reserved L3_78 costs 7W+3B, which with my bonuses (2W, 2B, 1R) reduces to 5W+1B needed. Taking WHITE+BLACK+RED gives me 4W+2B+1G+2R+1BL (11 tokens), exceeding the 10 token limit by 1. I must return 1 GREEN token to stay at 10 tokens total. After this move, I'll have 4W+2B available. Next turn (Turn 17), I'll reserve any Level 2 card to gain 1 GOLD token, giving me 4W+1GOLD+2B = 5W equivalent+2B. I can then immediately purchase L3_78 using 4W+1GOLD+1B, scoring 5 points to reach 8 points total. This executes my optimal path to victory established in my previous turns. Opponent will buy L1_32 next turn (1 point, GREEN bonus) with their 1BL+2GOLD, reaching only 1 point total, leaving me with a dominant 8-1 lead. Board has WHITE:1, BLACK:3, RED:2 available - all legal takes. I verified I can return 1 GREEN (currently have 2G).

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Current Situation Analysis:**

My Status:
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2 = 4 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Reserved: L1_32 (BLACK 4 cost → with bonus need 2 more BLACK), L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost → need 4 GREEN)
- Score: 0 prestige points

**Board Constraints:**
- GREEN tokens: 3 available (plenty!)
- All other colors: 1-3 available

**Strategic Analysis:**

I need to work toward my reserved prestige cards:
1. L1_24: Needs GREEN 4 - I have 0 GREEN tokens
2. L1_32: Needs BLACK 4 - I have 1 bonus, need 2 more tokens

GREEN is available and I have no GREEN tokens at all. Taking 3 GREEN tokens moves me toward L1_24 efficiently.

My Calculation: 4 current tokens + 3 GREEN = 7 tokens (under the 10 limit, no returns needed)

**Why not take other colors:**
- BLACK: Only 2 available, but GREEN is more plentiful
- Taking 3 GREEN is the most efficient path to a prestige card

**Next Turn:** After taking 3 GREEN, I'll have GREEN 3 toward L1_24. I'll need 1 more GREEN next turn to afford it. The GOLD tokens I have provide flexibility for that final purchase.

**Final Decision:** Take 3 GREEN tokens to progress toward L1_24, my reserved prestige card that gives 1 point toward the 15-point goal.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=3}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: I'm at 4 tokens and need to work toward my reserved cards. I have L1_24 (needs GREEN 4) and L1_32 (needs BLACK 4 → with BLACK 2 bonus, need 2 more BLACK tokens).

Board has BLACK 2 available, so I can take 2 BLACK tokens now. This gets me closer to purchasing L1_32.

However, I should also take tokens for my GREEN goal. With 4 tokens, taking 2 BLACK + 1 GREEN = 7 tokens total (within the 10 limit).

This gives me:
- BLACK: 1 → 3 (need 1 more to reach 4, then with bonus can buy L1_32)
- GREEN: 0 → 1 (need 3 more for L1_24)

After this, I'll have 7 tokens and can take 3 GREEN tokens next turn to reach 4 GREEN for L1_24.

Taking 2 BLACK is valid because BLACK has 2+ available on the board.

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 3 points with 10 tokens (4W, 2B, 1G, 2R, 1BL, 0 GOLD). My reserved L3_78 costs 5W+1B after bonuses (2W, 2B, 1R). I have 4W+2B but am 1 WHITE short. The board has 0 WHITE tokens available, so I cannot take WHITE directly. I must reserve a card to gain 1 GOLD token, which substitutes for the missing WHITE. I'll reserve L2_55 (2 points, WHITE bonus) to block my opponent who can afford it next turn with 1G+1R+2GOLD (covers the 1G+2R needed after their 2 RED bonuses). Blocking L2_55 denies opponent 1 extra point (they'll buy L1_32 for 1 point instead of 2). Reserving L2_55 gives me 1 GOLD, bringing me to 11 tokens. I must return 1 token to stay at 10. I'll return 1 BLUE, keeping 1B for L3_78 purchase. After returning: 4W, 1B, 1G, 2R, 1BL, 1GOLD = 10 tokens. Next turn (Turn 18), I purchase L3_78 using 4W+1GOLD+1B to reach 8 points. Opponent reaches only 1 point after buying L1_32. My 8-1 lead is commanding.

======================================================================================

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **My Current Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4), L1_32 (needs BLACK 4 → with bonus, need 2 more BLACK)
- Board has: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 1, GOLD 2

**My Goals:**
- L1_24 costs GREEN 4. With my WHITE 1 bonus, I need 3 more GREEN tokens.
- After taking 2 GREEN, I'll have GREEN 3/4 and can purchase L1_24 next turn.

**Why TAKE 2 GREEN + 1 BLUE is optimal:**
- 2 GREEN: Gets me to GREEN 3/4 (one more turn to go!)
- 1 BLUE: Gets me to BLUE 2 (adds flexibility)
- Valid move: GREEN has 2+ available, BLUE has 2+ available
- After this: 7 + 3 = 10 tokens total
- Next turn I can purchase L1_24 (cost GREEN 4 - WHITE 1 bonus = 3 GREEN needed, which I'll have)

**Alternative considered:**
- Taking BLACK is useless since only 1 BLACK is available (need 2 for a pair)
- Taking RED is less valuable since I already have RED 2 bonus

This move efficiently works toward purchasing L1_24, which gives WHITE bonus + 1 prestige point, moving me closer to my 15-point goal.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: **Analysis of my error and correction:**

My previous move was invalid because I tried to take 2 BLACK + 1 GREEN, which violates the token-taking rules. The rules state: take exactly 3 tokens of 3 DIFFERENT colors (1 each), OR take exactly 2 tokens of the SAME color (if 4+ available).

**Current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Bonuses: BLACK 2, RED 2, WHITE 1
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs 2 more BLACK to buy), L1_24 (needs 3 more GREEN to buy)

**Board availability:**
- GREEN: 2 available
- BLACK: 1 available (cannot take 2 of same color)

**Options:**
1. Take 2 GREEN tokens (valid since 2+ available)
2. Take 3 different colors (e.g., GREEN, BLUE, RED)

**Why taking 2 GREEN is optimal:**
- After taking: 9 tokens total (stays under 10)
- GREEN tokens: 1 → 3 (need 1 more for L1_24)
- Next turn: Can take 1 more GREEN to reach 4, then purchase L1_24
- L1_24 costs GREEN 4, with 0 bonus → fully affordable

**Why not 3 different colors:**
- Takes me to 10 tokens, eliminating flexibility
- 2 GREEN tokens is more focused progress toward L1_24
- I already have RED and BLUE bonuses, so those tokens are less urgent

**Decision: TAKE 2 GREEN tokens**

This move efficiently works toward my reserved prestige card L1_24 while maintaining strategic flexibility.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current situation carefully:

**My Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Bonuses: BLACK 2, RED 2, WHITE 1
- Purchased: L1_3, L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33, L1_36 (RED), L1_19 (WHITE)
- Reserved: L1_32 (needs BLACK 4 → with bonus, need 2 more BLACK), L1_24 (needs GREEN 4)
- Score: 0 prestige points

**Board Constraints:**
- WHITE tokens: 0 (cannot take)
- BLUE tokens: 2 available
- GREEN tokens: 2 available
- RED tokens: 1 available
- BLACK tokens: 1 available
- GOLD tokens: 2 available

**My Strategy:**
I need to make progress toward my reserved cards. L1_24 requires 4 GREEN (I have 1, need 3 more). L1_32 requires 4 BLACK (I have 2, with BLACK 2 bonus need 2 more BLACK).

**Decision: Take 2 GREEN tokens**

This gives me:
- GREEN: 1 → 3 (need 1 more for L1_24)
- Total tokens: 7 + 2 = 9 (within the 10 limit)

After this, I'll have 9 tokens. Next turn I can:
- Take 1 GREEN to reach 4 GREEN and purchase L1_24 (WHITE bonus + 1 prestige), OR
- Take 1 BLACK (if available) toward L1_32

GREEN is my priority because L1_24 has a prestige point and gives a WHITE bonus that helps qualify for nobles like N6 (WHITE 3).

Taking 2 of the same color is valid when 4+ are available on the board (2 available = can take up to 2).
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 2 available (need 4).. Skipping turn.

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 3 points with 10 tokens (4W, 1B, 1G, 2R, 1BL, 1GO). My reserved L3_78 costs 7W+3B base, which with my bonuses (2W, 2B, 1R) reduces to 5W+1B needed. I have exactly what I need: 4W+1GO=5W equivalent and 1B. Purchasing L3_78 this turn scores 5 points immediately, bringing me from 3 to 8 points total. This executes the strategy I've been building toward for the past 5 turns. With an 8-0 lead (opponent can buy L1_32 next turn for 1 point max), I'm in a commanding position to reach 15 points. After this purchase, I'll have 2W+3B+1R bonuses (gaining 1 BLUE from L3_78) and 4 tokens remaining (1G, 2R, 1BL). I can then pursue L2_70 (3 points, needs 5R after my 1R bonus) or other high-value cards. Purchasing L3_78 now is optimal - it's my highest-value affordable card and executes my planned path to victory.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 2, GOLD 2 = 7 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Reserved cards: L1_32 (BLACK 4 cost, GREEN bonus + 1 prestige), L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Score: 0 prestige points (behind opponent's 8!)
- Opponent has L3_78 scoring 5 points - I need to catch up fast!

**Key insight:** I can PURCHASE L1_32 RIGHT NOW!
- Cost: BLACK 4
- With my BLACK 2 bonus: cost reduces to BLACK 2
- I have BLACK 2 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. I have an affordable purchase available - no need to hoard tokens
2. Gets me 1 prestige point (critical as I'm behind 8 points)
3. Gives me GREEN bonus (new color for versatility)
4. Reduces tokens from 7 to 5, freeing capacity
5. Uses my existing BLACK 2 bonus efficiently

After purchase: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 5 tokens
Then I'll focus on accumulating GREEN tokens for L1_24 (need 3 more GREEN).

Taking tokens now would be wasteful when I have an immediate purchase opportunity!

======================================================================================

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 8 points with 4 tokens (1G, 2R, 1BL) and bonuses 2W+3B+1R. My reserved L2_55 costs 1G+4R+2BL base, which with my 1R bonus reduces to 1G+3R+2BL needed. I currently have 1G+2R+1BL, so I'm short 1R+1BL. Taking WHITE+RED+BLACK gives me exactly what I need: 1W+1G+3R+2BL (7 tokens total). Turn 20 I purchase L2_55 for 2 points (reaching 10 points) and gain WHITE bonus (3W+3B+1R total). Then I accumulate BLUE+GREEN tokens over 3-4 turns to purchase L3_86 (5 points, costs 4B+3G after my 3B bonus) for the win at 15 points. This is the fastest path to victory - alternatives like buying 0-point cards L1_28/L1_25 don't score, and other high-value cards like L2_70 (needs 5R, board has only 1R) or L2_44 (needs 5G+2R, scarce GREEN) require too many turns. Board has WHITE:4, RED:1, BLACK:3 confirming legal take. 7 tokens after taking is under 10 limit, no returns needed.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 5 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK), L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED), L1_36 (RED), L1_19 (WHITE), L1_32 (GREEN) = 6 cards, 1 prestige
- Reserved: L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Opponent score: 8 points (dangerously ahead!)

**My Goal:** Need 3 more GREEN tokens to purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point.

**Available tokens:** WHITE 3, BLUE 3, GREEN 2, BLACK 2 (RED 0)

**Best Move: Take 3 tokens (GREEN, BLUE, WHITE)**

This gives me:
- GREEN 2/4 toward L1_24 (need 2 more)
- BLUE 2, giving me access to L1_28 (requires BLUE 3, GREEN 1 - with my GREEN bonus, I'd need BLUE 2 which I could get next turn)
- WHITE 1 for flexibility and nobles (N6 needs WHITE 3, N3 needs WHITE 4)

After this: 5 + 3 = 8 tokens (under 10 limit)

**Next turns:**
- Turn 21: Take 2 GREEN (if available) → reach GREEN 4, purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point
- Or if not enough GREEN, continue building toward that goal

Taking tokens now is more efficient than reserving - I have plenty of capacity and can hit my L1_24 goal within 1-2 turns.

Reasoning: I'm at 8 points with 7 tokens (1W, 0B, 1G, 3R, 2BL, 0GOLD) and bonuses 2W+3B+1R. My reserved L2_55 costs 1G+4R+2BL base, which with my 1R bonus reduces to 1G+3R+2BL needed. I have exactly what I need: 1G+3R+2BL. Purchasing L2_55 now scores 2 points immediately (reaching 10 points total) and grants me a WHITE bonus (bringing me to 3W+3B+1R bonuses). After this purchase, I'll have 1W token remaining and can pursue L3_86 (5 points, costs 7B+3G base, reduced to 4B+3G with my 3B bonus) to reach 15 points. Over the next 3-4 turns, I'll accumulate 4 BLUE + 3 GREEN tokens (board currently has 2B+1G available) to purchase L3_86 for the win. This executes my planned path to victory. Opponent is at 1 point and will likely purchase their reserved L1_24 next turn for 2 points total, leaving me with a commanding 10-2 lead.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 5 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK), L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED), L1_36 (RED), L1_19 (WHITE), L1_32 (GREEN) = 1 prestige point
- Reserved: L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Score: 1 point (opponent has 10!)

**My Goal:** Need 3 more GREEN tokens to purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point.

**Board has:** WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 4, GOLD 3

**Strategy:**
- Take 2 GREEN tokens (the maximum available)
- Take 1 BLUE token for flexibility

After this turn: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 8 tokens

**Next turn:**
- Take remaining GREEN tokens (need 1 more)
- Purchase L1_24 for 1 prestige point
- Continue catching up to opponent's 10 points

This is the most efficient path to my reserved prestige card L1_24.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: **Analyzing my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 5 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: 6 cards with 1 prestige point
- Reserved: L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Opponent score: 10 points (dangerously ahead!)

**Board tokens available:** WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 4

**Error correction:** My previous move failed because I tried to take 2 GREEN tokens, but GREEN only has 2 on board (need 4 to take 2). I must take either 3 different colors OR 2 of the same color (requires 4+ available).

**Best move: Take 3 different tokens (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN)**

This is optimal because:
1. GREEN: 1→3 (need 1 more for L1_24)
2. WHITE: 0→1 (working toward N6's WHITE 3 requirement)
3. BLUE: 1→2 (building toward L1_28 which needs BLUE 3)

After this: 5 + 3 = 8 tokens total

**Next turn:** If GREEN available, take 1 GREEN to reach GREEN 4, then purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point. This gets me on the board and closer to catching up!
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 5 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: 6 cards, 1 prestige
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4, gives WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Opponent: 10 points - I'm behind and need to catch up!

**Available tokens on board:** WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 4

**My Goal:** Need 3 more GREEN tokens to purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point.

**Best Move: TAKE_TOKENS (2 GREEN)**

This is optimal because:
1. GREEN has 2+ available on board (valid for taking 2)
2. Gets me 2/3 of the way to my GREEN goal for L1_24
3. With my GREEN bonus, I only need to spend 2 more tokens to reach 4 total
4. Keeps me at 7 tokens (under 10 limit)
5. Efficiently uses my turn to progress toward a prestige point

**Why not other options:**
- 3 different tokens: Would give only 1 GREEN, which is less efficient for my L1_24 goal
- Reserve: Would give a gold token but doesn't directly advance my GREEN goal
- Purchase: I can't afford any visible cards right now

After this: GREEN 1 → 3 (need 1 more to reach 4, then I can purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point)
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 2 available (need 4).. Skipping turn.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, RED=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 points with 1 WHITE token and bonuses 3W+3B+1R. To reach 15 points, I need 5 more. L3_86 (5 points, costs 7B+3G) is my best target. With my 3B bonus, the effective cost is 4B+3G tokens. However, the board has only 2 BLUE available initially - after taking 1B on Turn 22 and 1B on Turn 23, the board would have 0B left, making it impossible to accumulate the 4B tokens needed. The solution is to reserve a card now for 1 GOLD token, which substitutes for the missing BLUE. I'll reserve L3_90 (5-point card with RED bonus, costs 7G+3R) - this blocks opponent from pursuing it while giving me GOLD. My path to victory: Turn 22 take BLUE+GREEN+WHITE (5 tokens total), Turn 23 take BLUE+GREEN+RED (8 tokens), Turn 24 take BLUE+GREEN+WHITE arriving at 11 tokens so return 1WHITE to stay at 10, then Turn 25 purchase L3_86 using 3B tokens + 1GOLD + 3G tokens = 4B+3G effective payment, scoring 5 points to reach 15 and win. This 5-turn plan is optimal given board token scarcity. Opponent is at 1 point, will buy reserved L1_24 next turn (costs 3G with their 1G bonus, they have 2G+2GOLD) reaching only 2 points, far behind my commanding 10-point lead.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L3_90, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Current Situation Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 6 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Score: 1 prestige point (trailing opponent's 10!)
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4 → I have GREEN 2, need 2 more)
- Board GREEN available: only 2

**Strategy:**
I need 2 more GREEN to purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point. But GREEN only has 2 on board, so I can't take 3.

**Optimal Action: Take 3 different tokens (GREEN, BLUE, WHITE)**

This gives me:
- GREEN: 2 → 4 (now CAN afford L1_24!)
- BLUE: 2 → 3 (unlocks L1_28 consideration)
- WHITE: 1 → 2 (noble flexibility for N3/N6)
- Total: 6 + 3 = 9 tokens (under 10 limit)

**Next Turn:** PURCHASE L1_24 (cost GREEN 4, with GREEN 4 bonus = FREE!) for +1 prestige point.

Taking tokens now is better than purchasing immediately because:
1. L1_24 requires all GREEN tokens which I need to take
2. This turn gives me flexibility (GREEN for L1_24, BLUE for L1_28 potential)
3. I maintain token capacity for future moves

The 3-different-tokens approach is most efficient given board constraints.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Analyzing my current situation:**
- Current tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 8 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK), L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED), L1_36 (RED), L1_19 (WHITE), L1_32 (GREEN) = 1 prestige
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4, worth 1 prestige)
- Score: 1 point (behind opponent's 10!)

**My goal:** Purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point. I need 2 more GREEN tokens (have GREEN 2).

**Board tokens available:** WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 4, GOLD 2

**Token constraint:** I have 8 tokens. If I take 3 tokens, I'd hit 11 (exceeds 10 limit). If I take 2 tokens, I'd be at 10 (at limit but valid).

**Best action: TAKE 2 GREEN tokens**
- This gives me GREEN 4 (reaching my L1_24 requirement!)
- New total: 8 + 2 = 10 tokens (at limit)
- After purchase: 10 - 4 = 6 tokens remaining

**Next turn:** I can purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point.

Taking only GREEN tokens is efficient toward my specific goal. Other color combinations would delay my progress toward L1_24.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: **Analyzing my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 5 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: L1_3 (BLACK), L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED), L1_36 (RED), L1_19 (WHITE), L1_32 (GREEN) = 6 cards, 1 prestige
- Reserved: L1_24 (GREEN 4 cost, WHITE bonus + 1 prestige)
- Opponent score: 10 points (dangerously ahead!)
- Current turn: 22

**Available tokens:** WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 4, GOLD 2

**My Goal:** Need 3 more GREEN tokens to purchase L1_24 for my 2nd prestige point.

**My previous mistake:** I tried to take 2 GREEN tokens, but there's only 2 GREEN available on the board, not 4. The rule states you can only take 2 of the same color if 4+ are available.

**Corrected Move: Take 3 tokens (WHITE, GREEN, RED)**

This gives me:
- WHITE: 0 → 1 (good for nobles N6/3)
- GREEN: 1 → 2 (need 2 more for L1_24)
- RED: 1 → 2 (good for noble N2)

After this: 5 + 3 = 8 tokens (under 10 limit, no need to return any)

**Next turn (Turn 23):** If there are enough GREEN tokens, I can:
- Take 2 GREEN (if available) → GREEN reaches 4
- Purchase L1_24 using 4 GREEN + 0 GOLD (with GREEN 1 bonus) for my 2nd prestige point

This plan efficiently builds toward my goal without wasting tokens or overloading my hand.

**Strategic rationale:** Taking tokens now is optimal because I have capacity (5/10 tokens) and need to accumulate GREEN for L1_24. I could reserve but there's no urgent need - I'm better off building my token base to purchase my already-reserved prestige card.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 points with 2 tokens (1W+1GOLD) and bonuses 3W+3B+1R. To win, I need 5 more points. My target is L3_86 (5 points, costs 7B+3G base, which reduces to 4B+3G with my 3B bonus). The board has only 2B and 2G available - not enough to buy L3_86 directly. However, when opponent buys their reserved L1_24 next turn (costs 3G), 2G tokens return to the board, giving me access to more GREEN. My 6-turn winning path: Turn 22 take WHITE+BLUE+GREEN (reaching 5 tokens total: 2W+1B+1G+1GOLD), Turn 23 opponent buys L1_24 (board gains 2G back making 3G available), Turn 24 take BLUE+GREEN+RED (reaching 8 tokens: 2W+2B+2G+1R+1GOLD), Turn 25 reserve a card to gain +1GOLD (reaching 9 tokens with 2GOLD total), Turn 26 take GREEN+WHITE+RED (12 tokens, return 2W to stay at 10), Turn 27 purchase L3_86 using 2B tokens+2GOLD (substituting for 2B)+3G tokens = 4B+3G effective payment, scoring 5 points to reach 15 and WIN. This path solves the BLUE scarcity problem (only 2B on board) by using 2 GOLD tokens as substitutes. Starting token accumulation NOW is critical to execute this 6-turn plan.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 8 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: L1_3, L1_5, L1_33, L1_36, L1_19, L1_32 = 1 prestige
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4 → with GREEN 1 bonus, need 3 more GREEN)
- Score: 1 prestige (vs opponent's 10 - need to catch up!)

**Critical Problem:** Board has only 1 GREEN token available, but I need 3 more to afford L1_24. Taking tokens alone won't get me there.

**Strategic Solution: RESERVE L2_48**
- Level 2 card with BLUE bonus and 1 prestige point
- Cost: BLUE 2, GREEN 3, BLACK 3
- With my bonuses: BLUE cost becomes 1 (2-1), GREEN cost becomes 2 (3-1), BLACK cost becomes 1 (3-2)
- I can eventually afford this with my current tokens + future collecting
- Getting a reserved card also gives me 1 GOLD token (reduces token count to 7)
- BLUE bonus helps me access more cards and work toward nobles like N6 (needs BLUE 3)

**Why not purchase L1_28?**
- Cost: BLUE 3, GREEN 1, WHITE 1
- With bonuses: GREEN cost becomes 0 (1-1), BLUE cost becomes 2 (3-1)
- I could afford this now, but it only gives 0 prestige
- L2_48 gives 1 prestige and a valuable BLUE bonus
- Rushing to buy L1_28 delays my prestige accumulation

**Why reserve instead of taking tokens?**
- I can only get 1 GREEN token (only 1 available on board)
- Taking tokens without enough GREEN available wastes a turn
- Reserving L2_48 gives me gold AND secures a prestige card

**After this action:**
- Tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, GOLD 3 = 9 total (gold increased by 1)
- Reserved: L1_24 (still pursuing), L2_48 (new strategic target)
- I'll continue collecting GREEN tokens while also building toward L2_48 affordability
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_48, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 points with 5 tokens (2W+1B+1G+1GOLD) and bonuses 3W+3B+1R. My goal is L3_86 (5 points, costs 7B+3G base = 4B+3G after my 3B bonus). Current board has only 1B+1G available - not enough to accumulate the required tokens. However, I can create a faster winning path by purchasing L2_49 NOW. L2_49 costs 5W+3B base, which with my 3W+3B bonuses reduces to exactly 2W+0B - I have the 2W tokens needed! This purchase: (1) Scores 2 points immediately (→12 points), (2) Grants +1 BLUE bonus (→3W+4B+1R total), reducing L3_86's cost from 4B+3G to 3B+3G - critically making it purchasable with limited board tokens. My 4-turn winning path: Turn 23 (NOW) buy L2_49 (→12pts, 1B+1G+1GOLD remaining), Turn 24 reserve a card to gain +1GOLD (→2GOLD total), Turn 25 take the BLUE+GREEN+WHITE from board (→2B+2G+2GOLD tokens), Turn 26 purchase L3_86 paying 2B+1GOLD+2G+1GOLD=3B+3G effective (→17pts WIN). The key insight: L2_49's BLUE bonus reduces L3_86 from needing 4B equivalent to 3B equivalent, which I can achieve with 2B tokens+1GOLD from board plus my current 1B and the extra GOLD from reserving. Opponent at 1 point cannot catch up in 4 turns. This is the fastest path to victory given current board constraints.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=3}
Reasoning: **Strategic Analysis:**

**My Current Situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 3 = 9 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Score: 1 prestige (vs opponent's 12 - critically behind!)
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 3 more), L2_48 (BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 1 more)

**Token Availability:**
- GREEN: 1 (insufficient to complete L1_24 alone)
- BLACK: 4 (good for L2_48)
- BLUE: 1 (good for L2_48)
- WHITE: 3 (good for L2_42)
- RED: 3 (good for L2_70)

**Why TAKE_TOKENS is optimal over PURCHASE:**
1. I can afford L1_20, L1_26, L1_25, L1_28 - but ALL give 0 prestige
2. At 1 prestige vs opponent's 12, I MUST prioritize prestige accumulation
3. Purchasing a 0-prestige card wastes a turn when I could be building toward prestige cards

**Why this specific token selection:**
- **1 GREEN**: Moves toward L1_24 (need 3 more → would have 3/4, need 1 more)
- **1 BLUE**: Moves toward L2_48 (need 2 more BLUE → would have 3/2, ready to buy!)
- **1 WHITE**: Builds toward L2_42 (WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLACK 2 cost) and nobles

**After this action:**
- Tokens: 9 + 3 = 10 total
- GREEN: 2 → 3 (1 more needed for L1_24)
- BLUE: 2 → 3 (enough for L2_48!)
- WHITE: 1 → 2

**Next turn:** I'll have enough BLUE to purchase L2_48 for 1 prestige point. This accelerates my catch-up from 1 to 2 prestige while opponent is at 12.

Taking tokens now is vastly superior to purchasing a 0-prestige card when I'm so far behind.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 9, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- Tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 2 = 8 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Purchased: 6 cards with 1 prestige point
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs GREEN 4), L2_48 (BLUE 2, GREEN 3, BLACK 3)
- Score: 1 (vs opponent's 12 - dangerously behind!)

**Available tokens:** WHITE 3, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 4

**My Strategic Opportunity:**
I can PURCHASE L1_32 RIGHT NOW!
- Cost: BLACK 4
- With my BLACK 2 bonus: cost reduces to BLACK 2
- I have 0 BLACK tokens, so I need to acquire 2 BLACK tokens first

**Action Plan:**
1. Take 2 BLACK tokens (BLACK has 4+ available)
2. After this: 8 + 2 = 10 tokens total
3. Next turn: PURCHASE L1_32 using my BLACK 2 bonus

**Why this is optimal:**
- Gets me my 2nd prestige point (critical to catch up from 1 vs 12)
- Gives me a GREEN bonus (adds versatility)
- Uses my existing BLACK 2 bonus efficiently
- Avoids token waste - I'm exactly at 10 after taking, no return needed

**Alternative considered:** Taking 3 different tokens would work but would require returning 1 token (wasteful). Taking 2 BLACK is more precise for my L1_32 purchase goal.

After purchasing L1_32 next turn, I'll have WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, GOLD 2 = 8 tokens again, and I can refocus on collecting GREEN tokens for L1_24.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 9, Taking: 2, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **My Critical Situation:**
- 9 tokens (at limit!), opponent has 12 prestige points and is winning
- Board has only 1 GREEN token but I need 3 more for L1_24
- Taking 3 tokens would exceed 10-token limit

**Solution: RESERVE L1_20**
- Takes 0 tokens (already at limit)
- Gives me 1 GOLD token (reduces count to 8, freeing capacity)
- Gets WHITE bonus (new color, helps toward N6 noble which needs WHITE 3)
- Cost: WHITE 3, BLUE 1, BLACK 1 - manageable with future collecting

**Why reserve L1_20 over other options:**
- Taking tokens impossible at 9/10 tokens
- L1_24 needs GREEN but only 1 GREEN available on board
- L1_20 gives me a valuable WHITE bonus for flexibility
- GOLD token received helps pay for any color

**After this:** 8 tokens (WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, GOLD 3)
Next turn I can take 3 tokens toward my goals, or purchase if affordable cards appear.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_20, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1}]

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 12, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 12 points with 3 tokens (1B, 1G, 1GOLD) and bonuses 3W+4B+1R. I need 3 more points to win. My original plan to buy L3_86 (5 points, costs 3B+3G after my 4B bonus) is blocked by GREEN scarcity - board has only 1 GREEN and I have 1 GREEN (2 total max), but L3_86 needs 3 GREEN tokens to purchase. Instead, I'll pursue L2_58 (WHITE bonus, 3 points, costs 6W base = 3W with my 3W bonus). Board has 3 WHITE available. My 4-turn winning path: Turn 24 (NOW) take WHITE+BLUE+GREEN reaching 6 tokens (1W+2B+2G+1GOLD), Turn 25 take WHITE+RED+BLACK reaching 7 tokens (2W+2B+2G+1R+1BL+1GOLD), Turn 26 take WHITE+RED+BLACK reaching 9 tokens (3W+2B+2G+2R+2BL+1GOLD), Turn 27 purchase L2_58 paying 3W tokens scoring 3 points to reach 15 and WIN. This is the fastest path to victory given current constraints. Alternative options: L3_86 impossible due to GREEN scarcity, L2_70 needs 5 RED (board has only 3), buying 0-point L1_28 for +1 GREEN bonus still leaves me short (would need 2G tokens but only 1G on board after spending my 1G to buy it). Opponent at 1 point will buy L1_24 next turn (→2 points) then needs multiple turns for high-value cards and cannot catch up in 4 turns. Taking WHITE+BLUE+GREEN is legal (3 different colors, board has W:3 B:2 G:1), and 6 tokens total is under the limit.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=4}
Reasoning: **Critical Analysis:**
- I'm at 9 tokens (at capacity!) and the opponent has 12 prestige points
- Board has GREEN 0, so I can't work toward my reserved L1_24 (needs 3 more GREEN)
- I need to act strategically to catch up

**Available Cards I Can Afford:**
1. **L1_25** - Costs WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 → with bonuses: 0 cost, gives GREEN bonus + 1 prestige
2. **L2_42** - Costs WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLACK 2 → with bonuses: WHITE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 0, gives 1 prestige + BLACK bonus
3. **L1_28** - Costs BLUE 3, GREEN 1, WHITE 1 → with bonuses: BLUE 2, WHITE 0, gives GREEN bonus

**Best Move: PURCHASE L1_25**
- **Cost: 0** after applying my bonuses (WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1 - each bonus covers one required token)
- **Reward: 1 prestige point** (critical to catch up from 1 to 2)
- **Bonus: GREEN** (helps toward my L1_24 reserved card goal)
- **Reduces tokens: 9 → 7** (frees up capacity for future moves)

This is a free purchase that gives me 1 prestige point and moves me closer to my GREEN accumulation goals. L1_25 costs me nothing and gives me immediate value. After this, I'll have 7 tokens and can take 3 tokens next turn (WHITE, BLUE, RED) to continue building toward L2_42 or other prestige cards.

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 12, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=6, GRN=2, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 12 points with 6 tokens (1W+2B+2G+0R+0BL+1GOLD) and bonuses 3W+4B+1R. I need 3 more points to win. My original L2_58 plan takes 3 turns, but I just realized I can win in 2 turns with L3_86! L3_86 (5 points) costs 7B+3G base, which my 4B bonus reduces to 3B+3G. On Turn 25 (NOW), I take WHITE+BLUE+RED reaching 9 tokens (2W+3B+2G+1R+1GOLD). The critical insight: I can pay for L3_86 using 3B tokens + 2G tokens + 1GOLD token, where GOLD substitutes for the missing 1G. Turn 26: Purchase L3_86 paying 3B+2G+1GOLD, scoring 5 points to reach 17 and WIN! This is 1 turn faster than my L2_58 path. Opponent at 1 point (even if they buy L3_72 for 4pts) cannot reach 15 before I win Turn 26. Board has 2W+2B+3R available, taking 3 different colors is legal, total 9 tokens under limit.

======================================================================================

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=4}
Reasoning: **Critical Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 0, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 4 = 8 total
- Bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 2
- Score: 1 prestige (vs opponent's 12 - desperately behind!)
- Reserved: L1_24 (needs 2 more GREEN), L2_48, L1_20

**Board Token Availability:** WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 2, BLACK 4

**My Goal:** Purchase L1_11 (WHITE 1, GREEN 2, RED 2 cost → with bonuses: WHITE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0 = free!)

**Token Collection Strategy:**
- L1_11 requires WHITE 1, GREEN 2, RED 2
- With my WHITE 1 bonus: WHITE cost becomes 0, so I need WHITE 1
- With my GREEN 2 bonus: GREEN cost becomes 0, so I need GREEN 0
- With my RED 2 bonus: RED cost becomes 0, so I need RED 0

**What I need to collect:**
- WHITE 1 token (to get WHITE 2 total, covering the required WHITE 1)
- Already have GREEN 2 (covered by GREEN 2 bonus)
- Already have RED 1 (with RED 2 bonus, RED 1 → RED 0 cost, need RED 2 total)

**Best Move: Take WHITE 1, RED 2 (3 tokens total)**
After: WHITE 2, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 0, GOLD 4 = 11 tokens (exceeds 10 limit!)
I need to return 1 token. I'll return 1 RED (keep RED 2, which covers my needs).

**Final State:** WHITE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 0, GOLD 4 = 10 tokens
**Next Turn:** Purchase L1_11 for FREE, gaining 1 prestige point (critical to catch up from 1 to 2)!
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=2}, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: **Error Correction:** I tried to take tokens without properly specifying the action type. Let me re-analyze the board and make a legal move.

**Current Situation:**
- 8 tokens (WHITE 1, BLUE 0, GREEN 2, RED 1, GOLD 4)
- Only 1 prestige point vs opponent's 12
- Board has GREEN 0, WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 4

**My Options:**
1. **TAKE_TOKENS**: Available combinations are WHITE+BLUE+RED (3 different colors) - this is legal!
2. **RESERVE_CARD**: Could reserve to get a gold token
3. **PURCHASE**: With my bonuses, L1_11 would be FREE (WHITE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0 after bonuses)

**Best Move: TAKE 3 TOKENS (WHITE, BLUE, RED)**
- This gives me WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 2, GREEN 2, GOLD 4 = 10 tokens (at limit)
- Works toward L1_26 (needs WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1 - I can afford this next turn)
- Also works toward L1_28 (needs BLUE 3, GREEN 1, WHITE 1 - making progress)
- Helps toward nobles N6 (BLUE 3, WHITE 3, BLACK 3) and N2 (GREEN 4, RED 4)

After this, I'll have 10 tokens. Next turn I can purchase L1_26 (which will become affordable) or reserve a card to free up space and get gold.

**Why not purchase L1_11 now?** It's free but gives 0 prestige. Taking tokens now positions me to afford L1_26 (also 0 prestige) or build toward prestige cards.

**Taking 3 different colors is legal per the rules.**
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Analysis of my current situation:**
- My tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 0, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 4 = 8 total
- My bonuses: WHITE 1, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 2
- My score: 1 prestige point (vs opponent's 12!)
- Purchased: L1_3, L1_5, L1_33, L1_36, L1_19, L1_32, L1_25
- Reserved: L1_24, L2_48, L1_20

**Board tokens available:** WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 2, BLACK 4

**My strategic goal:** Reach 15 prestige points. I need to work toward purchasing L2_42 (WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLACK 2) for 1 prestige, or focus on nobles.

**Available actions:**
- Taking 3 tokens: Would reach 11 tokens (exceeds limit) - NOT POSSIBLE
- Reserve a card: Gets 1 gold, costs 0 tokens - POSSIBLE
- Purchase a card: Need to check affordability

**Checking card affordability:**
- L1_28 (BLUE 3, GREEN 1, WHITE 1): With bonuses, cost is BLUE 2, WHITE 0, GREEN 0. Can't afford.
- L1_26 (WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 2): With bonuses, cost is WHITE 0, BLUE 0, RED 0, BLACK 1. Can't afford (need BLACK 1).
- L1_6 (WHITE 2, GREEN 2): With bonuses, cost is WHITE 1, GREEN 0. Can't afford.
- L1_11 (WHITE 1, GREEN 2, RED 2): With bonuses, cost is WHITE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0. Can't afford.
- L2_42 (WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLACK 2): With bonuses, cost is WHITE 2, GREEN 1, BLACK 0. Can't afford.
- L2_44 (GREEN 5, RED 3): With bonuses, cost is GREEN 3, RED 1. Can't afford.
- L2_70 (RED 6): With bonuses, cost is RED 4. Can't afford.
- L2_58 (WHITE 6): With bonuses, cost is WHITE 5. Can't afford.

**Decision: TAKE 2 TOKENS (WHITE, BLUE)**
- Taking 3 tokens would exceed 10-token limit (8 + 3 = 11)
- WHITE and BLUE are needed for L2_42 (needs WHITE 3 total)
- GREEN has 0 available on board, so can't take it
- Taking WHITE + BLUE brings me to exactly 9 tokens
- This maintains flexibility while working toward L2_42 affordability

**After this action:** WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 0, GOLD 4 = 9 tokens
Next turn I can take 3 tokens (WHITE, BLUE, RED) to continue building, or purchase if affordable cards appear.

**Why not reserve?** I already have 4 gold tokens and 3 reserved cards. More reserves without a clear purchase path wastes strategic opportunities. Taking tokens now is more productive.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.. Skipping turn.

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 12, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=7, GRN=2, RED=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 12 points with 9 tokens (2W+3B+2G+1R+1GOLD) and bonuses 3W+4B+1R. I need 3 more points to win. This is Turn 26, and I can execute my winning move NOW! L3_86 (5 points, GREEN bonus) costs 7B+3G base. With my 4B bonus, the effective cost is (7-4)B+3G = 3B+3G. I have exactly what I need: 3B tokens + 2G tokens + 1GOLD token (GOLD substitutes for the missing 1G). Payment breakdown: 3B tokens + 2G tokens + 1GOLD = 3B+3G equivalent cost. This purchase scores 5 points immediately: 12+5=17 points, exceeding 15 to WIN THE GAME! Opponent is at 1 point - even if they buy L3_72 (4 points, costs 5R effective with their 2R bonus, payable with 1R+4GOLD) this turn for 5 total points, they cannot catch my 17 points. Victory is assured. Purchasing L3_86 now with card_id='L3_86' and action_type='PURCHASE_CARD'.
