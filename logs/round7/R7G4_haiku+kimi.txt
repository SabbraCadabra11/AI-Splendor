Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: This is turn 1, my opening move. Strategic analysis:

1. CURRENT STATUS: I have 0 tokens and 0 prestige. Both opponents start with nothing.

2. BOARD STATE: All token colors (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK) have 4 tokens available, giving me flexibility.

3. KEY CARDS IDENTIFIED:
   - L3_78 (5 prestige): WHITE×7 BLUE×3 → best prestige reward
   - L3_88, L3_72, L3_73 (4 prestige each): Supporting options
   - L2_45, L2_49 (2 prestige each): Stepping stones with bonuses
   - Level 1 cards: Bonus builders

4. DECISION: Take 3 DIFFERENT tokens (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN)
   - Supports L3_78 path (needs WHITE and BLUE)
   - Maintains flexibility for multiple strategies
   - 3 tokens = safe, well-under 10-token limit
   - More adaptable than taking 2 of same color on turn 1

5. TOKEN MATH: Current (0) + Taking (3) = 3 → Valid, no returns needed.

6. LOGIC: Turn 1 is about resource building, not reserve blocking yet. Standard Splendor opening maximizes flexibility.

======================================================================================

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Current game state analysis:
1. We are Player 1 (currentPlayerIndex=1), this is turnNumber=1
2. We have 0 tokens currently, so we can take at most 10 tokens without returning any
3. Available tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=4, GOLD=5
4. We cannot take 2 of the same color because no color has 4+ tokens (all have 3-4)
5. Opponent (Player 0) has: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, and score=0
6. Face-up cards available:
   - Level 1: L1_7 (cost: 3 GREEN), L1_23 (cost: 3 BLUE), L1_37 (cost: 2 BLUE + 1 GREEN), L1_20 (cost: 3 WHITE + 1 BLUE + 1 BLACK)
   - Level 2: L2_66 (1 point), L2_54 (1 point), L2_45 (2 points), L2_49 (2 points)
   - Level 3: L3_72 (4 points), L3_78 (5 points), L3_88 (4 points), L3_73 (4 points)

Optimal opening strategy:
- We want to build towards prestige cards while denying opponents key resources
- Taking 3 different colors is the only valid move since no color has 4+ tokens
- Looking at Level 1 cards, BLUE and GREEN appear frequently in costs:
  - L1_7 needs 3 GREEN
  - L1_23 needs 3 BLUE
  - L1_37 needs 2 BLUE + 1 GREEN
- RED and BLACK are underutilized in Level 1 costs shown, but appear in higher level cards
- WHITE also appears in L1_20 and several Level 2/3 cards

Recommended opening: Take WHITE, BLUE, and RED

Why these colors:
1. BLUE appears in multiple Level 1 cards (L1_23 needs 3, L1_37 needs 2, L1_20 needs 1)
2. RED is available and needed for higher level cards (L2_66 needs 2, L3_72 needs 7, L3_73 needs 6)
3. WHITE is versatile and appears in L1_20 and several higher cards
4. This gives us flexibility to buy L1_37 (cost: 2 BLUE + 1 GREEN) if we get a GREEN later, or save for L1_23
5. We're not taking GREEN now because the board only has 3 GREEN tokens and we might want to take 2 GREEN later if we decide to go for L1_7
6. BLACK is also useful but taking RED gives us better long-term positioning for Level 2 and 3 cards

This provides the most flexible start to build our economy while keeping options open for multiple purchase pathways.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: Turn 2 strategic decision after establishing a 3-token foundation on turn 1.

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 (3 total), 0 prestige, 0 cards
- Opponent: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1 (3 total), 0 prestige, 0 cards
- Board token scarcity emerging: WHITE=2, BLUE=2 (down from 4), GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=4, GOLD=5

AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS:
No visible Level 1 cards are currently affordable:
- L1_37 (cheapest accessible): needs BLUE×2 GREEN×1 → I have BLUE×1, GREEN×1 (missing 1 BLUE)
- L1_7, L1_23, L1_20: all need 3 of a single color → I have only 1 of each
Conclusion: Token accumulation alone won't unlock purchases for multiple turns.

CRITICAL INSIGHT - THE GOLD TOKEN:
Reserving grants 1 gold token. Gold **substitutes any color** in costs. This changes my calculus:
- Now: 3 gem tokens + 1 gold = 4 resources, including 1 universal wildcard
- Next turn after taking 3 more gems: With 6 gems + 1 gold, I can afford Level 1 cards via gold substitution
- This accelerates my purchasing timeline by 1-2 turns vs. token-only path

WHY RESERVE L3_78 (not create, not wait):
1. **UNMATCHED PRESTIGE**: 5 points = 1/3 of winning score (15 needed). No other card matches this value.
2. **SCARCITY LOCK**: Only 4 Level 3 cards total. Opponent will likely reserve a high-value card next turn—if they claim L3_78, this prestige path closes permanently.
3. **RESOURCE ABUNDANCE vs CARD SCARCITY**: WHITE and BLUE tokens can be accumulated over several turns; this specific card cannot be regenerated.
4. **CLEAR WIN PATH**: L3_78 (BLUE bonus) + accumulated WHITE×7 BLUE×3 resources = confirmed 5 prestige + strategic positioning.

ALTERNATIVE (TAKE 3 TOKENS) WEAKNESSES:
- Taking RED, BLACK, GREEN reaches only 5 gems (still short of Level 1 purchases)
- No prestige secured (pure resource accumulation)
- No gold token (losing flexibility)
- Allows opponent to reserve L3_78 or another Level 3 card uncontested

BOTTOM LINE:
Reserving L3_78 provides:
- 5 prestige points (irreplaceable future value)
- 1 gold token (wildcard to unlock Level 1 purchases next turn)
- Blocks opponent from this elite card
- Sets a proven, efficient path to victory
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L3_78, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 3 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1) with no purchased cards. Opponent has 4 tokens and reserved L3_78 (5pts), needing WHITE and BLUE. Board has WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=4.

Strategic assessment: Cannot purchase any cards yet. Taking 2 of same color only valid for BLACK (4 available), but that doesn't advance immediate goals. Best is taking 3 different colors to set up next-turn purchase.

Key insight: L1_37 costs BLUE=2, GREEN=1 and provides RED bonus. After taking BLUE, GREEN, and BLACK, I'll have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, RED=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 (6 tokens total). This perfectly sets up purchasing L1_37 on my next turn, giving me a RED bonus to build towards higher-tier cards. 

BLUE is high-value (needed for L1_23, L1_37, L2_49, L3_84). GREEN starts my engine for L1_37 and potential N4 noble. BLACK provides long-term flexibility for L1_20, L2_66, L3_73 and nobles N5/N6 while denying opponent. This move gives optimal tempo and board position.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 3 ANALYSIS - Early Resource Positioning

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, GOLD=1 (4 total)
- My reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige, needs WHITE×7 BLUE×3)
- Opponent tokens: 6 total (ahead by 2)
- Board scarcity: WHITE=2, BLUE=1 (critically low), GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3

STRATEGIC POSITION:
I'm at a critical inflection point. Board tokens for WHITE and BLUE are depleting rapidly. My reserved L3_78 card requires exactly these two scarce resources. This is my moment to secure them before board scarcity becomes irreversible.

KEY CONSTRAINT: Token scarcity on board
- Only 2 WHITE tokens remain (I have 1, need 7 total for L3_78)
- Only 1 BLUE token remains on board (I have 1, need 3 total for L3_78)
- After my move, BLUE will be entirely depleted from board (0 remaining)

DECISION CALCULATION:
Option A - Take 3 DIFFERENT tokens (WHITE, BLUE, RED):
  Result: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=1 (7 total)
  Benefit: Secures both critical colors while available; depletes BLUE on board so opponent cannot starve me of it next turn
  Math: 4 current + 3 taking = 7 tokens ≤ 10 limit ✓

Option B - Buy L1_37 now (use GOLD as wildcard):
  Cost: BLUE×2, GREEN×1 (I have exactly this plus GOLD)
  Problem: Grants RED bonus (misdirected for L3_78 path); loses GOLD wildcard flexibility; leaves me with only WHITE=1 after sale
  Rejected: Inefficient resource burn

Option C - Reserve card (e.g., L2_45 for WHITE bonus):
  Benefit: +1 GOLD token
  Problem: Commits me to acquiring WHITE×5 for L2_45, delaying L3_78 path; opponent may accumulate to dangerous prestige levels unopposed
  Rejected: Too slow given board scarcity

FINAL LOGIC:
Taking WHITE, BLUE, RED is optimal because:
1. Extracts maximum scarcity value (WHITE and BLUE cannot wait)
2. RED is abundant (3 on board), so taking it prevents regret vs. taking scarce colors
3. Moves me from 4→7 tokens, maintaining sub-10 flexibility
4. Positions me to buy L1 cards OR continue accumulation next turn
5. After this move, opponent cannot compete for depleted BLUE on future turns
6. Transitions from pure accumulation to having choices (buy vs. take next turn)

TOKEN VERIFICATION:
Before: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, GOLD=1
Taking: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1 (3 different non-gold tokens)
After: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=1
Total: 2+2+1+1+1 = 7 tokens
7 ≤ 10 token limit ✓
No returns required.
Valid move per rules ✓

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: I have tokens WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (6 total). I cannot purchase L1_37 yet as I don't have the required BLUE count with only 2 tokens (need 3 total considering discounts). 

Key strategic issues:
1. Opponent has 2 WHITE and 2 BLUE tokens, likely aiming for L1_20 or L3_78. They only have 5 tokens total, so likely taking 3 next turn.
2. Board token counts: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3. BLUE is completely depleted.
3. If I try to take tokens: No color has 4+ tokens (can't take 2 of same color), so must take 3 different colors. Available colors: WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3. I could take GREEN, RED, BLACK.
4. After taking GREEN, RED, BLACK: I'd have WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 (9 tokens). Still couldn't purchase L1_37 (would need 3 BLUE total or 3 GREEN for L1_7).
5. The critical problem: If I don't reserve L1_37 now, my opponent might buy it next turn or it could get buried when new cards are drawn.

Reservation strategy:
- Reserving L1_37 secures this key card for my RED bonus engine
- I get 1 GOLD token (available), giving me WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (7 tokens total)
- Most importantly: I can use GOLD as a wild token when purchasing, meaning I now effectively have 3 BLUE tokens (2 BLUE + 1 GOLD) sufficient to buy L1_37 on my next turn
- Denies opponent access to this valuable RED bonus card
- Costs me the opportunity to take tokens this turn, but securing L1_37 is higher priority than gathering more tokens that won't help me purchase it yet
- Sets up a clear path: Next turn purchase L1_37 for RED bonus, then use that bonus to target high-value cards like L2_66 (cost: BLUE+RED+BLACK) or L3_73 (cost: GREEN+RED+BLACK)

This is the optimal tempo play - sacrificing immediate token gain to secure a superior board position and guaranteed purchase next turn.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_37, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 4 CRITICAL PIVOT - L3_78 Path Now Blocked

CURRENT STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=1 (7 total, 3 slots free)
- Prestige: 0
- Reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige, needs WHITE×7 BLUE×3)
- Board scarcity: WHITE=1, BLUE=0 remaining

L3_78 REASSESSMENT - BLOCKED:
My original L3_78 strategy assumed abundant board tokens. Reality check:
- L3_78 requires: WHITE×7 (have 2, need 5 more), BLUE×3 (have 2, need 1 more)
- Board resources: WHITE=1 available, BLUE=0 available
- To complete this card, I would need both:
  - All remaining WHITE (1) from board
  - Multiple future card draws to generate BLUE (impossible without bonuses I don't have)
  - Estimated 8+ turns to accumulation, during which opponent builds prestige
- VERDICT: This path is now too slow and resource-starved. I need to pivot.

PIVOT STRATEGY - L2_45 (2 PRESTIGE) INSTEAD:
L2_45 (BLACK bonus, 2 prestige): Requires only WHITE×5
- Immediate feasibility: Only needs WHITE (abundant relative to BLUE/rare colors)
- Bonus engine: BLACK bonus opens secondary prestige paths (nobles, combos)
- Timeline: Reserve now → 1 turn accumulation → Purchase by turn 5 with 2 prestige earned
- Advantage: Locks in prestige (opponent cannot steal), gets point progression running

TWO-TURN EXECUTION PATH:

Turn 4 (NOW): Reserve L2_45
- Gain: +1 GOLD token
- Result: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=2 (8 tokens total)
- Secured: 2 prestige points (reserved card cannot be lost)

Turn 5: Take WHITE, GREEN, RED (all available: W=1, G=2, R=2)
- Result: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, GOLD=2 (9 tokens), still under 10 limit
- Purchase L2_45 from reserved hand:
  - Cost: WHITE×5
  - Resources: WHITE×3 + GOLD×2 (GOLD substitutes 2 missing WHITE)
  - Transaction succeeds ✓
- After purchase: BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, prestige=2, +1 BLACK bonus, GOLD=0

WHY NOT JUST TAKE TOKENS INSTEAD?
- Slower: 9 tokens still falls short of L2_45 (need 5 WHITE, have 3). Requires second token-taking turn.
- Unsecured: Opponent can reserve/purchase L2_45 next turn, blocking my path.
- Risk: Pure accumulation without prestige locking wastes tempo while opponent may build early prestige advantage.

WHY NOT RESERVE L2_49 INSTEAD?
- L2_49 costs WHITE×5 + BLUE×3 (vs L2_45 costs WHITE×5 only)
- Both give 2 prestige, but L2_45 is strictly cheaper and faster to obtain
- Lock the easier target first, then pursue upgrades

RISK MITIGATION:
- By turn 5, I have 2 confirmed prestige (cannot be lost)
- Opponent is at 0 prestige (behind in point race)
- I establish bonus engine (BLACK) to accelerate future prestige paths
- This secures a competitive position and forces opponent to either match or pursue alternative routes

TOKEN MATH VERIFICATION:
- Before: 7 tokens (3 slots free)
- Reserve action: No tokens spent
- After reserve: 7 tokens + 1 GOLD gained = 8 tokens total
- Valid ✓ (under 10 limit, action is legal reserve)

CARD VERIFICATION:
- L2_45 exists on board: LEVEL_2, BLACK bonus, 2 prestige, WHITE×5 cost ✓ CONFIRMED
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_45, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 7 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1) and L1_37 reserved. The card costs BLUE=2, GREEN=1.

Key analysis:
1. **I can purchase L1_37 immediately** - I have exactly the required BLUE (2) and GREEN (1) tokens
2. **Strategic value** - L1_37 gives RED bonus, which is crucial for multiple high-value cards: L1_16 (cost RED=4, gives 1pt), L2_66 (cost BLUE=3+RED=2+BLACK=3, gives 1pt), and Level 3 cards like L3_73 (cost GREEN=3+RED=6+BLACK=3, gives 4pts)
3. **Opponent pressure** - Player 0 has 2 GOLD tokens and has reserved L3_78 (5pts). I need to start building my engine now rather than delay
4. **Post-purchase position** - After buying, I'll have RED=1 bonus, 4 tokens remaining, and an empty reserve slot for future use
5. **No token return needed** - I'll drop from 7 to 4 tokens, well under the 10-token limit

This is the optimal tempo play - converting my reserved card into an active bonus that enables multiple scoring pathways while freeing up my reserve slot. It also denies the opponent any chance to disrupt my L1_37 acquisition.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: TURN 5 EXECUTION - Securing Resources for L2_45 Purchase

CURRENT POSITION:
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=2 (8 total, 2 slots available)
- Prestige: 0
- Reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige) and L2_45 (2 prestige)
- Strategy: Implement the two-turn L2_45 acquisition plan

L2_45 AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS:
L2_45 requires: WHITE×5
Current resources: WHITE=2 + GOLD=2 = 4 coverage for WHITE cost
Resource gap: Need 1 more coverage to reach WHITE×5

SOLUTION: Accumulate 1 additional WHITE coverage this turn
Then on Turn 6: Purchase L2_45 with WHITE=3 + GOLD=2 (paying WHITE×5 exactly)

TOKEN SELECTION RATIONALE:
Take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 (3 DIFFERENT colors):

- WHITE=1 (board: 1 available): ESSENTIAL - closes the 1-resource gap for L2_45; no other path
- GREEN=1 (board: 3 available): Abundant; safe to take and return if needed
- RED=1 (board: 2 available): Moderately scarce; maintains future flexibility for N5 noble path (RED×4) or L3_72 (RED×7). Also reserves board RED for opponent interference

Why not take BLUE instead?: BLUE=2 is strategically important for L3_78 (reserved, needs BLUE×3). Preserving board BLUE prevents opponent from starving me of this critical resource later. Current BLUE=2 is sufficient for immediate needs.

TOKEN LIMIT MANAGEMENT:
- Current: 8 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens (different colors: WHITE+GREEN+RED)
- Before return: 8 + 3 = 11 tokens → EXCEEDS 10-token limit
- Must return: 1 token to comply with rules
- Return GREEN=1 (abundant on board; less strategically critical than RED)
- Final after return: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, GOLD=2 (10 tokens exactly) ✓

BOARD VERIFICATION:
- WHITE: 1 available, taking 1 ✓
- GREEN: 3 available, taking 1 ✓ and returning 1 ✓
- RED: 2 available, taking 1 ✓
All tokens exist on board. Move is legal.

STRATEGIC OUTCOME:
- Turn 5 end state: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, GOLD=2 (10 tokens)
- Turn 6 plan: Purchase L2_45 → WHITE=3 + GOLD=2 pays WHITE×5 cost ✓
- Result: Gain 2 prestige + BLACK bonus; position for prestige acceleration
- Opponent remains at 0 prestige while I secure early points
- BLACK bonus enables secondary prestige paths (L3_72 via BLACK card chain, N5 noble requiring BLACK×4)

TIMING OPTIMIZATION:
This 2-turn sequence (reserve on Turn 4, accumulate on Turn 5, purchase on Turn 6) maintains momentum while opponent is still at 4 tokens and 0 prestige. By Turn 6, I'll have secured 2 prestige and established a bonus engine—a significant advantage.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: I have 4 tokens (W=1,R=1,K=1,Gold=1) with RED=1 bonus from L1_37. Opponent can immediately purchase L1_16 (1pt, BLUE bonus) using their R=2 + Gold=2. L1_16 is critical for my strategy - it's a cheap point source and BLUE bonus enables L2_66, L3_84, and other high-value cards. Since opponent has 2 reserves already and cannot reserve more, securing L1_16 prevents them from acquiring this key card while setting me up to purchase it next turn with my R=1 token + Gold=2 + R=1 bonus. Board has GOLD=2 available, so I'll receive one gold token, bringing me to 5 total tokens (no returns needed). This is superior to taking tokens because L1_16 is vulnerable and perfectly fits my engine-building path.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: TURN 6 CORE EXECUTION - Purchase L2_45 from reserved hand.

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, GOLD=2 (10 total, at max capacity)
- My prestige: 0 (but 2 points locked via L2_45 reserved card)
- My reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige), L2_45 (2 prestige) ← ready for purchase NOW
- Opponent: 0 prestige, path to prestige cards unclear

L2_45 AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:
Card requirement: WHITE×5
My resources: WHITE=3 + GOLD=2 (GOLD substitutes for 2 missing WHITE gems) = 5 coverage ✓

PURCHASE EXECUTION:
- Pay exactly: 3 WHITE tokens + 2 GOLD tokens → satisfies WHITE×5 requirement
- Receive: 2 prestige points + BLACK bonus
- After purchase tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, GOLD=0 (5 total)

STRATEGIC VALUE:
1. **PRESTIGE MILESTONE**: Jump from 0 → 2 points while opponent languishes at 0 prestige. Establish 2-point lead in the 15-point race.
2. **BONUS ENGINE ACTIVATED**: BLACK bonus modifier enables future prestige paths (L3_72 via RED×7 accumulation, N5 noble route via RED×4 BLACK×4).
3. **TOKEN SCALABILITY RESTORED**: Reduce from maxed-out 10 tokens to 5, freeing up 5 token slots. Turn 7+ can accumulate new resources without mandatory returns.
4. **TEMPO ADVANTAGE**: Opponent has no prestige cards in production; they must now race to match my 2-point baseline.
5. **TURN 4 PIVOT VALIDATED**: The strategic pivot away from blocked L3_78 path to faster L2_45 acquisition is now confirmed as correct execution.

NOBLE CHECK (not yet triggered):
- N6 (BLUE×3 WHITE×3 BLACK×3): I have BLUE=2, WHITE=0, BLACK=1 → not met ✗
- N5 (RED×4 BLACK×4): I have RED=2, BLACK=1 → not met ✗
- N4 (GREEN×4 BLUE×4): I have GREEN=1, BLUE=2 → not met ✗
Nobles remain targets for turns 8-10.

CARD VERIFICATION:
L2_45 exists in my reserved hand: LEVEL_2, BLACK bonus, 2 prestige, cost WHITE×5 ✓ CONFIRMED

CONCLUSION:
Execute planned purchase. Convert 3 prestige-locked cards into 2 realized prestige points + establish BLACK bonus engine. Move from prestige=0 → prestige=2, establishing commanding lead while opponent remains at 0 prestige.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 5 tokens (WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=2) with RED=1 bonus from purchased L1_37. My reserved card L1_16 costs RED=4 and provides 1 prestige point + BLUE bonus.

Key calculation: I can purchase L1_16 immediately using RED=1 token + GOLD=2 (wildcards) + RED=1 bonus = 4 effective RED. This expenditure is optimal because:

1. **Immediate scoring**: I gain 1 prestige point (from 0 to 1), keeping pace with opponent's 2 points
2. **Engine building**: BLUE bonus combines with my existing RED bonus to enable multiple high-value purchases:
   - L2_66 (1pt): needs BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3 → now needs BLUE=3, RED=1, BLACK=3
   - L2_54 (1pt): needs WHITE=2, BLUE=3, RED=3 → now needs WHITE=2, BLUE=3, RED=2
   - L3_84 (4pt): needs BLUE=7 → now needs BLUE=6
3. **Noble path**: BLUE bonus progresses toward noble N6 (requires BLUE=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3)
4. **Denial**: Opponent has RED=2 tokens and could potentially purchase L1_16 if I don't
5. **Token efficiency**: After purchase, I'll have 2 tokens remaining (WHITE=1, BLACK=1), well under limit, with no returns needed

Alternative consideration: Taking 3 tokens (WHITE, GREEN, BLACK) would delay scoring and risk losing L1_16. Reserving another card is suboptimal as I'm already positioned to buy L1_16. This purchase is the highest-value tempo play available.

Decision: Purchase L1_16 now to score points, secure BLUE bonus, and accelerate toward Level 2/3 cards and nobles.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_16]

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: TURN 7 STRATEGIC PIVOT - FOCUS ON N5 NOBLE PATH

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 (5 total, 5 slots free)
- My prestige: 2 (from L2_45 purchase)
- My purchased: L2_45 (BLACK bonus +1)
- My reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige, WHITE×7+BLUE×3, now strategically blocked)
- Board: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=5
- Opponent prestige: 1 (far behind)

L3_78 RESERVED CARD - REALISTIC ASSESSMENT:
The 5-prestige L3_78 card is effectively locked:
- Requires: WHITE×7 + BLUE×3 (10 gems total)
- Board has: WHITE=3 + BLUE=2 (only 5 gems available)
- Even consuming all board tokens, I'd fall short of 10 needed gems
- Opponent will contest remaining WHITE tokens
- Timeline: 8-10 turns minimum while opponent accelerates
- VERDICT: Accept L3_78 as sunk resource; pivot to achievable prestige sources

AVAILABLE PRESTIGE PATHS - CONFIDENCE RANKING:
1. **N5 NOBLE - HIGHEST CONFIDENCE (3 prestige):**
   - Requirement: RED×4 + BLACK×4
   - Current: RED=2, BLACK=1
   - Gap: RED×2 more, BLACK×3 more
   - Achievable: YES, within 2 turns ✓
   - Cumulative result: 2 current + 3 (N5) = 5 prestige by Turn 9
   
2. L3_72 (4 prestige, RED×7) - SECONDARY:
   - Current: RED=2, need RED×5 more
   - Dependency: Multiple RED bonus cards + board RED exhaustion
   - Timeline: 4-5 turns post-N5 claim
   - Cumulative by Turn 13: 5 + 4 = 9 prestige
   
3. L3_84 (4 prestige, BLUE×7) - TOO SLOW:
   - Current: BLUE=2, need BLUE×5 more
   - No BLUE bonuses available; board limited (2 remaining)
   - Not viable

OPTIMAL STRATEGY - PHASE 1: N5 ACCUMULATION

N5 Requirements: RED×4 + BLACK×4 (auto-trigger 3 prestige)
Current Status: RED=2, BLACK=1 (BLACK bonus active from L2_45)
Remaining Gap: RED+2, BLACK+3

TURN 7 (NOW) - Core resource accumulation:
- Action: Take RED=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1 (3 DIFFERENT colors)
- Justification:
  - RED and BLACK directly close N5 requirement gaps (primary objective)
  - WHITE (third color) provides secondary flexibility for future L2 purchases
  - Board availability: WHITE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3 (all sufficient) ✓
  - Token math: 5 current + 3 taking = 8 tokens total (2 slots free, safe) ✓
  - New state: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (8 tokens)

TURN 8 PLANNED:
- Action: Take RED=1, BLACK=1, GREEN=1
- Result: RED=4, BLACK=3 (approaching N5 threshold)

TURN 9 PLANNED:
- Action: Take BLACK=1 + another color
- Result: Reach BLACK×4 requirement
- AUTO-TRIGGER: N5 noble claimed → +3 prestige
- Prestige milestone: 2 + 3 = 5 prestige (1/3 of 15-point goal)
- Opponent still at 1 prestige (4-point lead established)

PHASE 2: L3_72 ACCUMULATION (Turns 10-11):
- With RED×4, BLACK×4 locked from N5, focus accumulation on RED×3 more
- Target: RED×7 for L3_72 (4 prestige)
- Cumulative: 5 + 4 = 9 prestige by Turn 11

PHASE 3: FINAL PRESTIGE (Turns 12-15):
- Remaining sources: L2_49 (2 prestige), L2_68 (2 prestige), N6 or N4 nobles (3 prestige each)
- With 9 prestige, need 6 more
- Multiple paths to 15: Any combination of 2 L2 purchases + 1 noble = 7 prestige buffer

WIN CONFIDENCE: HIGH
- Turn 9: 5 prestige (opponent remains at 1) → Lead by 4 points, at critical milestone
- Turn 11: 9 prestige (opponent likely still at 1-2) → Commanding position
- Turn 13-15: 15+ prestige achievable via remaining cards → Victory secured

TOKEN COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION:
- Current tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1 (5 total)
- Action: Take RED=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1 (exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors, 1 each)
- After action: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (8 total)
- Token limit: 8 ≤ 10 ✓
- Returns: None required ✓
- Move legality: VALID ✓

BOARD VERIFICATION:
- WHITE: 3 available, taking 1 ✓
- RED: 2 available, taking 1 ✓
- BLACK: 3 available, taking 1 ✓
All tokens exist on board. Move is legal.

CONCLUSION:
Execute N5 noble accumulation strategy. Pivot away from now-unreachable L3_78 to confirmed prestige source (N5 guaranteed within 2 turns). Establish dominant board position (5 prestige vs opponent's 1) and clear mathematical path to 15 points by Turn 13-15.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: I have 2 tokens (WHITE=1, BLACK=1) with BLUE=1 and RED=1 bonuses, score=1. Opponent has 2 points with L3_78 reserved. I cannot purchase any cards yet. Board has RED=1 token available, which is scarce.

Strategic assessment:
1. **Cannot purchase**: No card is affordable with current tokens/bonuses
2. **Token acquisition**: Only valid move is taking 3 different colors (no color has 4+ tokens)
3. **Target priority**: L2_66 gives 1 point + RED bonus, costs BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. After my bonuses, I need BLUE=2, RED=1, BLACK=2.
4. **Optimal token selection**: Taking BLUE, RED, and BLACK tokens maximizes progress toward L2_66 while denying opponent the scarce RED token (only 1 available).
5. **Post-action position**: I'll have WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 (5 tokens total). Still need one more BLUE token to purchase L2_66 next turn.
6. **Alternative consideration**: Reserving L2_49 (2pts) would be slower - I'd need to gather 5 WHITE tokens over multiple turns, and opponent might score first. Taking tokens now for L2_66 is faster tempo.

Decision: Take BLUE, RED, and BLACK tokens to efficiently build toward L2_66, deny opponent resources, and maintain good token economy (no returns needed).
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 8 STRATEGIC PIVOT - Red Token Depletion Forces Plan Adjustment

CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2, GOLD=0 (9 total)
- My prestige: 2
- Opponent prestige: 1
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=1

N5 NOBLE PLAN - BLOCKED:
My Turn 7 strategy committed to accumulating RED tokens on turns 8-9 via the sequence: Take RED+BLACK+WHITE each turn until triggering N5 (RED×4 BLACK×4). However:
- CRITICAL BLOCKER: Board RED=0 (completely depleted)
- Cannot take RED tokens that don't exist on the board
- N5 path now requires: (1) Purchase a RED-bonus card first, (2) Accumulate RED via bonus, (3) THEN pursue N5
- Revised timeline: 8+ turns vs. previous 2-turn estimate
- Meanwhile, opponent accelerates prestige accumulation unopposed

PIVOT STRATEGY - L2_49 PRESTIGE CARD:
Given RED scarcity invalidates the N5 path, I'm pivoting to L2_49 (2 prestige, BLUE bonus).

L2_49 ADVANTAGES:
- Card: LEVEL_2, BLUE bonus, 2 prestige
- Cost: WHITE×5 + BLUE×3
- Current resources: WHITE=1, BLUE=2 (need WHITE+4, BLUE+1)
- Board availability: WHITE=2, BLUE=1 available (sufficient for Phase 1 accumulation)
- Timeline: Achieve by Turn 10 (2-turn accumulation window)
- Generates BLUE bonus → opens secondary prestige paths (N6 noble, L3_84)

WHY RESERVE L2_49 NOW:
1. **Lock prestige**: 2 points secured and cannot be stolen by opponent
2. **Gain +1 GOLD**: Increases token-spending flexibility for future gem substitution
3. **Establish clear accumulation target**: WHITE×5 BLUE×3 (focused resource gathering)
4. **Tempo win**: By Turn 10, I'll have 4 prestige (2 from L2_45 + 2 from L2_49) while opponent likely remains at 1-2 prestige
5. **Board space management**: Reserving a card maintains my token ceiling at 10 (can take full 3-token sets on Turn 9 without mandatory returns)

TURN 8-11 EXECUTION ROADMAP:
- **Turn 8 (NOW)**: Reserve L2_49 → Gain +1 GOLD token, maintain 9 tokens, lock 2 prestige
- **Turn 9**: Take WHITE+BLUE+GREEN (3 different colors) → WHITE×2, BLUE×3, GREEN×2 (may need return 2 to stay at 10 limit)
- **Turn 10**: Take WHITE tokens + board pickup → Reach WHITE×5 BLUE×3, purchase L2_49 from reserved hand using GOLD for gem substitution if needed
- **Result by Turn 10**: 4 prestige + BLUE bonus (opponent likely 1-2 prestige)

WHY NOT TAKE TOKENS THIS TURN:
- Reserve action gains +1 GOLD (more flexible than raw token accumulation)
- Locks in prestige before opponent can compete for L2_49
- Maintains token ceiling at 10 for smooth Turn 9 multi-token take
- Reserve + Gold token combo is superior to take → return sequence

FALLBACK PRESTIGE SOURCES (if L2_49 becomes unavailable):
- L2_68 (2 prestige, RED bonus): Requires WHITE×3 BLACK×5 (slower due to BLACK scarcity)
- L2_49 is strictly cheaper and faster
- Noble N6 (3 prestige): BLUE×3 WHITE×3 BLACK×3 (requires massive accumulation)

PATH TO 15 PRESTIGE:
- Turn 10: 4 prestige (2 from L2_45 + 2 from L2_49)
- Turn 12-13: Acquire L2_68 or another L2 card (→ 6-8 prestige)
- Turn 14-15: Secure 1 noble (N6 or secondary source) (→ 9-11 prestige) + remaining L3 cards
- Victory by Turn 15 highly probable

L2_49 confirmed on board (LEVEL_2, BLUE bonus, 2 prestige, cost WHITE×5+BLUE×3) ✓

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Strategic analysis of current state:

My position: 5 tokens (W=1,B=1,R=1,K=2), bonuses RED=1/BLUE=1, score=1. Opponent: 9 tokens, 2 reserves (L3_78, L2_49), score=2.

Key observations:
1. L2_66 is the optimal target: 1 prestige point + RED bonus, perfectly synergizing with my existing RED/BLUE engine
2. After bonuses, L2_66 costs me: BLUE=2, RED=1, BLACK=3 tokens
3. I currently have: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 - need BLUE=1, BLACK=1 more
4. CRITICAL RISK: Opponent only needs BLUE=1 more token to purchase L2_66 (they have BLUE=2, RED=3, BLACK=2 effective). If I don't secure it now, they could take BLUE next turn and buy it.
5. Opponent has 2 reserves already, so they CANNOT reserve L2_66 themselves
6. Board has scarce BLUE=1 and BLACK=1 tokens - opponent at 9 tokens may take them to avoid discarding

Reserving L2_66 now provides:
- Guaranteed acquisition of this key scoring card
- 1 GOLD token (immediate flexibility for purchasing)
- Denies opponent any path to this card
- Sets up clear next-turn purchase: take BLUE token, then spend BLUE=2, RED=1, BLACK=2 + GOLD=1 to complete purchase

Alternative of taking tokens now risks opponent stealing L2_66, while reserving guarantees this 1-point card that builds my RED bonus engine toward higher-value targets like L3_73 (4pts).
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_66, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 9 STRATEGIC CONTINUATION - L2_49 RESOURCES ACCUMULATION PHASE 1

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (9 total, 1 free slot)
- My prestige: 2 (from L2_45)
- Opponent prestige: 1 (3-point deficit for opponent)
- Reserved: L2_49 (2 prestige locked, WHITE×5 BLUE×3 cost)
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=1

L2_49 PURCHASE MOMENTUM:
Turn 8 reservation of L2_49 was correct pivot away from blocked N5 noble (RED depleted on board). Now executing Phase 1 accumulation:

L2_49 Requirements: WHITE×5 + BLUE×3
Current progress: WHITE=1 (gap: 4), BLUE=2 (gap: 1)
Resource coverage via GOLD: GOLD×1 can substitute for 1 WHITE, reducing net gap to 3 WHITE needed

Board inventory for taking:
- WHITE: 2 available (taking 1, preserves 1 for flexibility)
- BLUE: 1 available (critical, only source remaining; must take to reach BLUE=3)
- GREEN: 3 available (abundant; safe third color for token action)

TURN 9 EXECUTION:
Take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 (exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors, legal move)

Token accounting:
- Current: 9 tokens
- After taking 3: 9 + 3 = 12 tokens (EXCEEDS 10-token limit)
- Must return: 2 tokens to comply with 10-token maximum

Strategic return selection:
1. Return RED=1: RED board depleted (RED=0), making RED tokens non-regenerating and low-priority. Returning RED frees allocation.
2. Return GREEN=1: Just acquired 1 GREEN; with GREEN=1 already in hand, returning the newly taken GREEN balances without compromising longer-term GREEN availability (board has 2 remaining).

FINAL TOKEN STATE (Turn 9):
WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (10 tokens exactly, at max capacity)

L2_49 PROGRESS CHECK:
- BLUE: 3/3 requirement MET ✓
- WHITE: 2/5 + GOLD=1 (covers 1 substitute) = 3 effective coverage; need 2 more WHITE tokens for Turn 10 purchase execution
- With board still containing WHITE=1 and GOLD substitution capability, Turn 10 purchase is mathematically achievable

VALIDATION:
- Action: 3 DIFFERENT colors, 1 each ✓ (legal)
- Board resources: WHITE(2), BLUE(1), GREEN(3) all available ✓
- Token math: 9 + 3 - 2 = 10 ✓ (compliant)
- Returns: RED (obsolete) + GREEN (duplicate) = strategic ✓

TURN 10 PLAN:
Purchase L2_49 from reserved hand using WHITE tokens + GOLD substitution. Gain 2 prestige + BLUE bonus. Cumulative prestige: 4 points (opponent at 1, lead: 3 points). Position for Phase 2 focusing on secondary prestige sources (N6 noble or L3 card chains with BLUE bonus active).

WIN TRAJECTORY:
- Turn 10: 4 prestige (secured)
- Turn 12+: Secondary L2 purchases or noble triggers (targeting 9-11 prestige range)
- Turn 14+: Final L3 cards or noble completion (15+ prestige achievable)
- Opponent deficit: Sustained 3+ point lead through mid-game
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn={GREEN=1, RED=1}]

======================================================================================

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 6 tokens (W=1,B=1,R=1,K=2,G=1) with BLUE=1 and RED=1 bonuses, L2_66 reserved. I need BLUE=1 and BLACK=1 more to purchase L2_66 (actual cost after bonuses: BLUE=2, RED=1, BLACK=3). However, BLUE=0 on board currently, making it impossible to complete the purchase this turn. 

Strategic assessment:
1. **No purchase possible**: L2_66 requires BLUE token that's unavailable; no other card is affordable
2. **Optimal token selection**: Board has scarce RED=1 and BLACK=1 tokens. Taking these denies opponent crucial resources while directly advancing my L2_66 completion
3. **Third token**: WHITE=1 is available and useful for future cards like L2_54 (2pts), L2_68 (2pts), and nobles
4. **Opponent constraint**: Player 0 has 10 tokens (max) and cannot take tokens without discarding. They may purchase L1_23 (cost BLUE=3) which would replenish BLUE tokens next turn - perfect timing for my plan
5. **Post-action position**: I'll have W=2,B=1,R=2,K=3,G=1 (9 total). When BLUE appears, I can immediately purchase L2_66 using BLUE=1 token + GOLD=1 wildcard, scoring 1 point and gaining RED bonus to accelerate toward L3_73 (4pts)
6. **Alternative rejected**: Reserving another card would delay my L2_66 purchase and waste a turn when I can productively gather required resources

Taking RED, BLACK, and WHITE tokens is the optimal tempo play that denies opponent resources while perfectly positioning me to score next turn.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 10 EXECUTION - TOKEN DEPLETION CRISIS MANAGEMENT

CRITICAL SITUATION:
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (10 total, at max capacity)
- My prestige: 2
- Board tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=0, GOLD=3 (SEVERE DEPLETION)
- Opponent: 1 prestige with L2_66 reserved (also token-starved)

TOKEN-TAKING IMPOSSIBILITY:
Available board tokens: GREEN=3, GOLD=3 (ONLY 2 colors)
Legal token rules require EITHER:
1. Take 3 DIFFERENT colors (1 each): IMPOSSIBLE—only 2 colors available
2. Take 2 of SAME color with 4+ on board: IMPOSSIBLE—both GREEN=3 and GOLD=3 are below threshold

CONCLUSION: Cannot execute TAKE_TOKENS action. Board depletion has eliminated token-taking pathway.

L2_49 RESERVATION STATUS - BLOCKED:
My L2_49 card requires WHITE×5 + BLUE×3. Current coverage:
- BLUE×3: Exact match ✓
- WHITE×2 + GOLD×1: Only covers 3 of 5 required WHITE
- Gap: Need 2 additional WHITE gems with no board WHITE available
PATH BLOCKED due to token scarcity.

ALTERNATIVE: PRODUCTIVE CARD PURCHASE

L2_54 AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:
Card: LEVEL_2, WHITE bonus, 1 prestige
Cost requirement: WHITE×2, BLUE×3, RED×3
My resources: WHITE=2 ✓, BLUE=3 ✓, RED=2 + GOLD=1 (substitutes for 1 RED) ✓
Payment sequence: 2 WHITE tokens + 3 BLUE tokens + 2 RED tokens + 1 GOLD token = exact affordability ✓

STRATEGIC VALUE OF L2_54 PURCHASE:
1. **PRESTIGE GAIN**: +1 prestige point (2 → 3), extending lead over opponent (who remains at 1 prestige)
2. **BONUS ACTIVATION**: Acquire WHITE bonus. Combined with existing BLACK bonus (from L2_45), dual modifiers now apply to all future gem costs, enabling faster acquisition of white-intensive cards like L2_68, L3_72
3. **TOKEN LIBERATION**: Spend 10 tokens' worth of gems, immediately freeing 8 of 10 token slots. Current maxed state becomes liquidity constrained; this purchase unlocks future accumulation capacity
4. **BOARD REFRESH ADVANTAGE**: Purchasing triggers LEVEL_2 deck draw, replacing L2_54 with new card. Introduces fresh prestige or bonus-generating opportunities
5. **OPPONENT CONTAINMENT**: While opponent is also token-locked (board depleted, can't take tokens), they remain at 1 prestige. Purchasing maintains my 2-point lead during this crucial mid-game phase

TOKEN ACCOUNTING (POST-PURCHASE):
Before: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (10 total, 0 free slots)
Pay for L2_54: -2 WHITE, -3 BLUE, -2 RED, -1 GOLD
After: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (2 total tokens, 8 free slots)

WHY NOT RESERVE INSTEAD?
Reserving a card (e.g., L2_68, L3_72):
- Gains +1 GOLD token (11 total, exceeds limit, must return 1 to comply)
- Net result: 10 tokens, locks a card you cannot currently afford
- Does NOT free slots or advance prestige
- Inferior choice given current resource scarcity and token bottleneck
Purchasing is strictly superior: achieves prestige increment + bonus generation + token liberation simultaneously.

PATH FORWARD (TURN 11+):
After this purchase: Prestige=3, Bonuses=BLACK×1+WHITE×1, Token slots=8 available
Next phases:
- Attempt N4 noble (GREEN×4, BLUE×4 → 3 prestige) if tokens replenish
- Target secondary L2 cards (L2_61, L2_57) with reduced gem costs via twin bonuses
- Position for L3 prestige cards (L3_72, L3_88) via bonus cost reduction
Prestige trajectory: 3 (now) → 5-6 (Turn 12) → 9+ (Turn 14) → 15 (Turn 15 victory window)

CARD VERIFICATION:
L2_54 exists on board: LEVEL_2, WHITE bonus, 1 prestige, cost WHITE×2+BLUE×3+RED×3 ✓

CONCLUSION:
Execute L2_54 purchase. Convert maxed-out token state into prestige gain + bonus engine + future flexibility. Maintain prestige lead while opponent is also token-constrained. Board refresh opens new strategic possibilities post-purchase.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have a clear, immediate purchase available for L2_66 that scores a point and builds my engine perfectly. My current tokens (BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=1) combined with my bonuses (BLUE=1, RED=1) can cover the card's cost of BLUE=3, RED=2, BLACK=3. I'll spend BLUE=1 token + GOLD=1 (as wildcard for BLUE) + RED=1 token + BLACK=3 tokens. This scores me 1 prestige point (going from 1 to 2), increases my RED bonus to 2 total, and leaves me with 3 tokens (WHITE=2, RED=1) for flexibility next turn. This is far superior to taking tokens (would need to discard) or reserving (would delay scoring). The RED=2 bonus now makes cards like L3_88 (4pts) cost only GREEN=5 instead of 7, and L2_57 (2pts) costs just RED=3 instead of 5. This is the optimal tempo play that catches me up on points while accelerating my engine toward higher-value targets.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 11 TOKEN ACCUMULATION - L2_49 PRESTIGE CARD PATHWAY

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (2 total, 8 free slots)
- My prestige: 3 (from L2_45 + L2_54 purchases)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1 (from L2_54), BLACK=1 (from L2_45)
- My reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige, blocked by scarcity), L2_49 (2 prestige, achievable target)
- Opponent prestige: 2 (I lead by 1 point)
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=4, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=3, GOLD=5 (abundant)

L2_49 RESERVED CARD - OPTIMAL PRESTIGE TARGET:
Card: LEVEL_2, BLUE bonus, 2 prestige points
Requirement: WHITE×5 + BLUE×3
With my WHITE bonus active: Effective cost WHITE×4 + BLUE×3 (reduced by 1)
Current progress: WHITE=0/4, BLUE=0/3
Acquisition timeline: Achievable by Turn 14-15 with consistent accumulation

WHY L2_49 IS SUPERIOR TO ALTERNATIVES:
1. **Reserved lock**: Cannot be stolen by opponent; prestige is secured if accumulated
2. **Bonus acceleration**: Acquiring BLUE bonus expands future paths (N6 noble potential, L3_84 access)
3. **Cumulative prestige**: 3 (current) + 2 (L2_49) = 5 prestige, extending lead over opponent's 2
4. **Compounding advantage**: With 3 active bonuses post-purchase (WHITE, BLACK, BLUE), secondary L2 cards become more affordable
5. **Clear accumulation path**: Both WHITE and BLUE are available on board in quantities 2+ (sustainable multi-turn harvesting)

TURN 11 ACTION - PHASE 1 INITIATION:
Take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 (exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors, legal move)

Token selection rationale:
- WHITE=1: Direct contribution toward L2_49 requirement. Board has WHITE=2; safe to take 1 while preserving board flexibility.
- BLUE=1: Direct contribution toward L2_49 requirement. Board has BLUE=4; abundant BLUE availability across multiple turns.
- GREEN=1: Flexibility token providing access to secondary prestige pathways (N4 noble GREEN=4, L2_41 BLUE/GREEN/WHITE flexibility).

Board resource verification:
- WHITE: 2 available → taking 1 ✓ (legal single-color take)
- BLUE: 4 available → taking 1 ✓ (legal quantity)
- GREEN: 3 available → taking 1 ✓ (legal quantity)

Token compliance:
- My current total: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 = 2 tokens
- After taking 3 gems: 2 + 3 = 5 tokens total
- Token limit: 5 ≤ 10 ✓ (well below capacity)
- Returns required: 0 ✓ (no mandatory discard)
- Free slots after: 10 - 5 = 5 slots available for Turn 12+ accumulation ✓

FUTURE STATE PROJECTION (Turns 12-14):
- Turn 12: +WHITE=1, +BLUE=1 → WHITE=2, BLUE=2 (total 6 tokens)
- Turn 13: +WHITE=1, +BLUE=1 → WHITE=3, BLUE=3 (total 7 tokens)
- Turn 14: +WHITE=1 → WHITE=4, BLUE=3 (total 7 tokens) → ACQUIRE L2_49

L2_49 PURCHASE EXECUTION (Turn 14):
- Spend: 4 WHITE tokens (exact with bonus reduction) + 3 BLUE tokens
- Receive: +2 prestige points + BLUE bonus
- Post-purchase: Prestige=5, Active bonuses=WHITE+BLACK+BLUE (triple modifier)
- Token slots freed: 7 → 0 (immediate restart accumulation for secondary phase)

SECONDARY PRESTIGE SOURCES (Post-L2_49 Phase):
With 5 prestige and 3 active bonuses, next targets become viable:
- L2_68 (2 prestige, effective cost WHITE×2 BLACK×4): Accelerated via bonuses
- N4 noble (3 prestige, effective cost GREEN×4 BLUE×3): BLUE bonus reduces requirement
- L2_61 (2 prestige, effective cost WHITE×3 BLUE×1): Both bonuses active

VICTORY TRAJECTORY:
- Turn 11 (now): 3 prestige, initiate WHITE+BLUE accumulation
- Turn 14: 5 prestige (L2_49 acquired)
- Turn 16: 7 prestige (secondary L2 card + noble)
- Turn 18: 10+ prestige (additional noble or L3 card start)
- Turn 20: 15+ prestige (final L2/L3/noble combination) → VICTORY

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Opponent (2 prestige) is pursuing RED-heavy path (RED×2 bonus) toward L2_57 or L3_72. Even if opponent reaches 4 prestige by Turn 14 via L2_57 acquisition, I maintain 5-prestige lead by that same turn. Critical prestige milestone secured before opponent can escalate.

CONCLUSION:
Execute WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 accumulation. Initiate Phase 1 of L2_49 acquisition sequence. Maintain prestige lead through Token 14, then activate triple-bonus engine for dominance phase (Turns 15-20). Clear mathematical path to 15-point victory by mid-endgame.

Reasoning: I have a strong RED engine (RED=2 bonus) and L2_57 is a perfect target costing RED=5 for 2 prestige points plus a WHITE bonus. Reserving now gives me immediate GOLD token and requires only RED=1 more token to purchase next turn (cost: RED=3 after bonuses, I'll have RED=1 token + GOLD=1). This denies opponent the card and sets up a 2-point score bringing me to 4 total, surpassing their 3. Opponent cannot reserve more cards (already has 2). This is more efficient than taking generic tokens which don't guarantee near-term scoring.

======================================================================================

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 12 STRATEGIC SHIFT - DUAL-PATH OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (5 total, 5 free slots)
- My prestige: 3 (from L2_45, L2_54)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=1
- My reserved: L3_78, L2_49 (2 prestige locked)
- Opponent prestige: 2 (I lead by 1 point)
- Board tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3, GOLD=4 (abundant BLUE/GREEN/RED)

STRATEGIC REALIZATION - N4 NOBLE VS L2_49:
I've been pursuing L2_49 (WHITE×1 + BLUE×3 cost, 2 prestige), but a critical shift emerges:

N4 NOBLE PATH (3 prestige, GREEN×4 + BLUE×4):
- Current progress: GREEN=2/4, BLUE=1/4
- Gap needed: GREEN×2, BLUE×3 (only 5 tokens total)
- Timeline: 3 turns maximum
- Cumulative prestige: 3 + 3 = 6 prestige (40% of 15-point goal)
- Key advantage: Exploits abundant BLUE (3 on board) and GREEN (2 on board) before opponent depletes them

L2_49 CARD PATH (2 prestige, WHITE×4 effective + BLUE×3):
- Current progress: WHITE=1/4 (with bonus reduction), BLUE=1/3
- Gap needed: WHITE×3, BLUE×2
- Critical blocker: WHITE board depleting (only 1 available now vs 3 initially)
- GOLD substitution option exists but requires complex token management
- Timeline: 3-4 turns (dependent on GOLD accumulation)
- Cumulative prestige: 3 + 2 = 5 prestige

N4 IS SUPERIOR: Higher prestige gain (3 vs 2) in same timeframe (3 turns), without reliance on depleting WHITE resource.

DUAL-PATH INSIGHT:
Taking WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 today PRESERVES BOTH OPTIONS:
- If N4 path completes Turn 14, I achieve 6 prestige and can pivot to other sources
- If opponent disrupts N4 accumulation, I've accumulated progres toward L2_49 (reserved safely)
- Flexibility maximized through independent colored token accumulation

TURN 12 EXECUTION - N4 INITIATION:
Action: Take WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 (exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors, legal move)

Token accounting:
- Current: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 = 5 tokens
- After taking 3: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 = 8 tokens
- Token limit: 8 ≤ 10 ✓
- Returns required: None ✓

Board verification:
- WHITE: 1 available, taking 1 ✓
- BLUE: 3 available, taking 1 ✓
- GREEN: 2 available, taking 1 ✓

N4 PROGRESS CHECKPOINT:
- GREEN: 3/4 (67% complete)
- BLUE: 2/4 (50% complete)
- Remaining gap: GREEN×1 + BLUE×2 (only 3 more tokens needed)

TURNS 13-14 PROJECTED SEQUENCE:
- Turn 13: Take GREEN=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1 → GREEN=4 ✓, BLUE=3, return RED to comply with 10-token maximum
- Turn 14: Take BLUE=1 → BLUE=4 ✓, trigger N4 noble → +3 prestige, cumulative: 6 prestige

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
- Opponent pursuing L2_57 (RED×5 requirement, RED bonuses active)
- Even if opponent reaches 4 prestige, I'll have 6 prestige by Turn 14 → extend lead to 2+ points
- N4 completion establishes commanding mid-game position

WIN TRAJECTORY UPDATED:
- Turn 14: 6 prestige (N4 triggered)
- Turn 16+: Secondary prestige sources (L2_49, L2_68, secondary nobles via accumulated bonuses)
- Turn 18+: L3 cards become accessible via accumulated bonuses
- Victory: 15+ prestige achievable by Turn 18-20 timeframe

CONCLUSION:
Execute dual-path accumulation. Prioritize N4 noble (3 prestige, 3 turns) as primary goal while maintaining L2_49 optionality. Board resource abundance (BLUE=3, GREEN=2 after this turn) makes N4 acquisition highly probable. Establish 6-prestige milestone by Turn 14, creating insurmountable lead over opponent.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 4 tokens (WHITE=2, RED=1, GOLD=1) with BLUE=1 and RED=2 bonuses, L2_57 reserved, score=2. Opponent has 3 points.

Strategic assessment:
1. **No purchase possible**: L2_57 costs RED=5, after RED bonus=2 I need RED=3 effective. I have RED=1 token + GOLD=1 = RED=2 effective, still short by 1 RED.
2. **Optimal token target**: Taking a RED token enables L2_57 purchase next turn (will have RED=2 tokens + GOLD=1 = RED=3 effective). This scores 2 points, bringing me to 4 total and giving WHITE bonus.
3. **Resource denial**: Opponent only has RED=0 and BLACK=1 tokens. Taking RED and BLACK denies them scarce resources while directly advancing my plan.
4. **Third token**: Taking BLUE gives me a token I currently lack (BLUE=0), and with BLUE bonus=1, I effectively have BLUE=2 value for future purchases like noble N6 (needs BLUE=2 effective).
5. **Opponent constraint**: Player 0 has 8 tokens and cannot reserve more cards (already has 2). They may purchase L1_7 (cost GREEN=3) which they can afford, but this doesn't disrupt my plan.
6. **Post-action position**: I'll have WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (7 total). Next turn I purchase L2_57 to score 2 points and gain WHITE bonus, accelerating toward noble N6 and higher-value targets.
7. **Alternative rejected**: Reserving would delay my clear path to 4 points. Taking non-optimal tokens (like GREEN) would slow my engine.

Taking RED, BLACK, and BLUE tokens is the optimal tempo play that efficiently builds my engine while denying opponent resources.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 13 STRATEGIC DECISION - CRITICAL REASSESSMENT AND CARD PURCHASE PIVOT

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (8 total, 2 free slots)
- My prestige: 3 (from L2_45 + L2_54)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1 (from L2_54), BLACK=1 (from L2_45)
- My reserved: L3_78 (5 prestige, cost WHITE×7 BLUE×3 - unaffordable), L2_49 (2 prestige, cost WHITE×5 BLUE×3 with bonus)
- Opponent prestige: 2 (I lead by 1 point)
- Board tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2, GOLD=4 (CRITICAL DEPLETION)

N4 NOBLE PATH - BLOCKED BY BOARD SCARCITY:
Previous plan committed to N4 noble (GREEN×4, BLUE×4 → 3 prestige). However, FATAL BLOCKER identified:
- Current progress: GREEN=3 ✓, BLUE=2 (gap: BLUE×2 needed)
- Board BLUE availability: Only BLUE=1 remaining on entire board
- Mathematical impossibility: Even if I take BLUE=1, maximum achievable is BLUE=3 (need BLUE=4)
- ZERO additional BLUE tokens can be obtained from board after first take
- CONCLUSION: N4 noble is mathematically unachievable. Pivot required immediately.

L2_49 RESERVED CARD - ALSO BLOCKED:
- Cost: WHITE×5 + BLUE×3 (with WHITE bonus: WHITE×4 effective + BLUE×3)
- Current: WHITE=2/4, BLUE=2/3
- Gap: WHITE×2 + BLUE×1
- Board WHITE: 0 available ✗
- Board BLUE: 1 available (could get BLUE to 3)
- CONCLUSION: Cannot close WHITE gap. L2_49 unaffordable this turn cycle.

OPTIMAL STRATEGY SHIFT - IMMEDIATE CARD PURCHASE:
With N4 blocked and major cards unaffordable, board depletion makes multi-turn accumulation inefficient. CONVERT EXISTING TOKEN RESOURCES into prestige via strategic card purchase.

AFFORDABLE CARD ANALYSIS:

**L2_41** (LEVEL_2, BLACK bonus, 1 prestige):
- Original cost: WHITE×3, BLUE×2, GREEN×2
- With my WHITE bonus: Effective cost WHITE×2, BLUE×2, GREEN×2 (reduced by 1)
- Current tokens: WHITE=2 ✓, BLUE=2 ✓, GREEN=3 ✓ (use 2, preserve 1)
- Status: AFFORDABLE - EXACT MATCH ✓
- Payment sequence: 2 WHITE + 2 BLUE + 2 GREEN = 7 gems spent
- Post-purchase: Prestige=4, Bonuses=WHITE×1+BLACK×2, Tokens=GREEN×1
- Board refresh: New LEVEL_2 card drawn from deck

**Other options verified as unaffordable or inferior:**
- L1_7 (GREEN×3): AFFORDABLE but 0 prestige (inferior to L2_41's +1)
- L2_61 (WHITE×4, BLUE×2, BLACK×1 effective): Gap WHITE×1, board has WHITE=0 ✗
- L1_23 (BLUE×3): Would require token investment for 0 prestige ✗
- L2_68, L3_cards: All blocked by WHITE=0 or RED scarcity ✗

WHY L2_41 PURCHASE IS OPTIMAL:

1. **Prestige extension**: +1 immediate prestige (3→4 prestige), opponent remains at 2 → lead extends to 2 points
2. **Cumulative bonus activation**: Second BLACK bonus acquired (BLACK=2 total). This multiplies efficiency of future Black-intensive cards like L2_68
3. **Token liberation**: Convert 7 gem-unit values into prestige + bonus. Freeing 8 of 10 slots enables fresh accumulation cycle next turn
4. **Tempo dominance**: Immediate tempo advantage vs. spending 2-3 turns accumulating with depleted board
5. **Opponent containment**: While opponent token-locked (trying to accumulate RED for L2_57), I advance prestige lead
6. **Board refresh opportunity**: New card from LEVEL_2 deck might provide better path forward (L2_57 if opponent takes it, or new fresh prestige source)

WHY NOT RESERVE INSTEAD:
- Reserve action gains +1 GOLD (9 tokens total, no return required)
- Does NOT gain prestige immediately
- Locks in an unaffordable card (L3_78 or L2_49 still require accumulation)
- Prestige race: Opponent has 2, I must extend lead NOW before they catch up
- Purchase strictly dominates reserve in current position

WHY NOT TAKE TOKENS THIS TURN:
- Board depletion extreme: WHITE=0, only BLUE=1, GREEN=1 available
- Legal token take limited to: 3 different colors like (RED×1, BLACK×1, GOLD×1)
- Result: Marginal token accumulation (typically -1 net after return for 10-limit compliance)
- Without prestige or bonus generation from a purchase, token accumulation is just treading water
- Future turns: Tokens still won't regenerate fast enough to close gaps on expensive cards
- Purchasing now converts dead tokens into productive prestige

VICTORY TRAJECTORY POST-PURCHASE:
- **Turn 13 (NOW)**: Purchase L2_41 → Prestige=4, BLACK×2 active, tokens=GREEN×1
- **Turn 14**: Take RED×1, BLACK×1, GOLD×1 → Accumulate for Phase 2
- **Turns 15-16**: Acquire secondary L2 cards (L2_68, L2_61) leveraging triple-bonus cost reduction
- **Turns 17-18**: Target L3 card or trigger secondary noble (N6 or N5 if board regenerates)
- **Projected prestige**: 4 (Turn 13) → 6 (Turn 15) → 9+ (Turn 17) → 15 (Turn 19-20) VICTORY

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Opponent (2 prestige, RED×2 bonus active) pursuing L2_57 (RED×5 → 2 prestige). Even if opponent reaches 4 prestige by Turn 15, I'll have 6+ prestige by same time. Lead maintained and extended through bonus multiplier effect.

CONCLUSION:
With N4 noble mathematically impossible and board token scarcity preventing efficient multi-turn accumulation, PURCHASE L2_41 converts existing resources into prestige gain + bonus engine. Maintains 2-point prestige lead, activates second BLACK bonus for future acceleration, and keeps opponent in deficit position. Optimal play for mid-game tempo victory.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=4, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: My analysis reveals I have an immediate winning move: Purchasing reserved card L2_57 for 2 points. With RED bonus of 2, the effective cost is RED=3. I have exactly RED=2 tokens + GOLD=1 wildcard to pay for it. This scores 2 points (moving from 2 to 4, tying opponent), grants WHITE bonus advancing toward noble N6, and uses my GOLD efficiently. Opponent cannot purchase anything this turn with only GREEN=1,BLACK=1 tokens, so scoring now is critical. No token combination or reservation offers comparable value. Taking tokens would waste a turn when I can score immediately. This purchase perfectly executes my engine-building strategy while maintaining tempo in the race to 15 points.

The action fields below implement this exact purchase: no tokens taken or returned, card_id="L2_57", action_type="PURCHASE_CARD".

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: TURN 14 - PRESTIGE PARITY RECOGNITION AND N6 NOBLE ACCELERATION PATH

CURRENT CRITICAL SITUATION:
- My prestige: 4 (tied with opponent at 4 - CRITICAL PARITY)
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (2 total, 8 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2 (triple-bonus synergy active)
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=2, GOLD=5 (abundant, diverse)
- Opponent: 4 prestige, pursuing RED-heavy path for L2_70 (RED×6 → 3 prestige)

STRATEGIC REALIZATION - PRESTIGE RACE URGENCY:
Opponent is TIED at 4 prestige. If opponent accumulates RED tokens and purchases L2_70, they reach 7 prestige, matching or exceeding any slow accumulation on my side. I must move quickly to extend prestige lead BEFORE opponent catches up.

N6 NOBLE PATH - OPTIMAL 3-PRESTIGE SOURCE:
Noble N6: 3 prestige, requires BLUE×3 + WHITE×3 + BLACK×3

With my bonuses applied:
- WHITE bonus (×1): Reduces WHITE cost by 1 → effective WHITE×2 needed
- BLACK bonus (×2): Reduces BLACK cost by 2 → effective BLACK×1 needed
- BLUE: No bonus → effective BLUE×3 needed

Effective N6 requirement = BLUE×3 + WHITE×2 + BLACK×1

Current resource state:
- BLACK: I have BLACK=1 ✓ (EXACT MATCH to requirement, no accumulation needed!)
- BLUE: I have BLUE=0, need BLUE×3 (board has BLUE=3 available)
- WHITE: I have WHITE=0, need WHITE×2 (board has WHITE=2 available)

CRITICAL INSIGHT: I need only 5 tokens total (BLUE×3 + WHITE×2) to complete N6, versus 7+ for alternative nobles (N4: GREEN×3 + BLUE×4).

ACCUMULATION TIMELINE PROJECTION:
Turn 14 (now): Take WHITE×1, BLUE×1, GREEN×1
- After: Tokens = WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (5 total)
- Board: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=2, GOLD=5
- Progress: WHITE=1/2 (50%), BLUE=1/3 (33%), BLACK=1/1 (100% ✓)

Turn 15: Take WHITE×1, BLUE×1, RED×1
- After: Tokens = WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (7 total)
- Board: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2, GOLD=5
- Progress: WHITE=2/2 (100% ✓), BLUE=2/3 (67%), BLACK=1/1 (100% ✓)

Turn 16: Take BLUE×1, RED×1, GOLD×1
- After: Tokens = WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 total)
- Progress: WHITE=2/2 ✓, BLUE=3/3 ✓, BLACK=1/1 ✓ → N6 COMPLETE
- PURCHASE N6 noble immediately → +3 prestige
- Prestige: 4 → 7 (opponent locked at ≤5 by same timeline)

WHY N6 DOMINATES ALTERNATIVES:
1. **Efficiency**: Requires only 5 net tokens (BLACK already satisfied). N4 requires 7 tokens (3+4).
2. **Speed**: 3-turn timeline to prestige +3. Higher probability of completion before opponent blocks resource availability.
3. **Prestige lead**: At Turn 16, I reach 7 prestige while opponent struggles to reach 5. Establishes 2-point lead.
4. **Bonus synergy**: My WHITE and BLACK bonuses directly reduce N6 cost, cannot be duplicated with other nobles.

VICTORY TRAJECTORY POST-N6:
- Turn 16: 7 prestige (N6 triggered)
- Turn 18+: Secondary prestige sources (L2_49 reserved for 2 prestige, L2_67 options, another noble)
- Projected: 7 (Turn 16) → 9 (Turn 18) → 12 (Turn 20) → 15 (Turn 22-23) VICTORY

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
- Opponent pursuing L2_70 (RED×6, effective RED×4 with opponent's RED×2 bonus → 3 prestige)
- Opponent needs RED×4, currently has RED=0
- Timeline: Opponent takes RED×2 (Turn 14), then would need 2+ more turns to accumulate RED×4 total
- By Turn 16, opponent still materializing L2_70 (unlikely completed), while I complete N6
- Result: I extend lead to 2+ points before opponent's prestige spike

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 2 tokens
- Taking 3 DIFFERENT colors: WHITE×1, BLUE×1, GREEN×1 = 3 tokens
- After: 2 + 3 = 5 tokens ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

CONCLUSION:
Execute N6 accumulation initiation. Take WHITE×1, BLUE×1, GREEN×1 to start the 3-turn pathway toward 3-prestige noble acquisition. Prestige parity is critical (both at 4), and N6 offers fastest route to extend lead to 7 prestige by Turn 16, establishing commanding position before opponent can escalate further.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 4 points (tied with opponent) with bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=2. Current tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (4 total). Opponent has 4 points with bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2.

Strategic assessment:
1. **No immediate purchase available**: No cards are affordable with current tokens and bonuses. My best target is L2_68 (2pts, RED bonus) which costs WHITE=3, BLACK=5; after bonuses I need WHITE=2, BLACK=4 effectively.
2. **Optimal token selection**: Board has scarce resources - BLACK=2, WHITE=1, GREEN=2. Taking BLACK and WHITE directly advances my L2_68 plan.
3. **Third token**: BLUE=2 available. Taking BLUE gives me flexibility for future purchases and denies opponent access.
4. **Resource denial**: Opponent has BLACK=1 token and needs BLACK for their target L2_45 (costs WHITE=5). Taking BLACK tokens limits their options.
5. **Post-action position**: I'll have WHITE=3, BLUE=2, RED=0, BLACK=2, GOLD=0 (7 total). This puts me 3 BLACK tokens short of L2_68.
6. **Opponent constraint**: Player 0 has 5 tokens and can take 3 more. They cannot purchase L1_32 (cost BLACK=4) yet, and their reserved cards are expensive (L3_78: WHITE=7,BLUE=3; L2_49: WHITE=5,BLUE=3).
7. **Alternative rejected**: Reserving a card would delay my point acquisition. L2_68 is the most efficient path to score and build my RED engine further.

Taking BLACK, WHITE, and BLUE tokens efficiently builds toward L2_68 purchase while denying opponent key resources.

======================================================================================

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: TURN 15 - CRITICAL PRESTIGE PARITY AND OPPONENT THREAT MITIGATION

CURRENT SITUATION:
- My prestige: 4 (TIED with opponent)
- Opponent prestige: 4
- Board tokens: WHITE=0 (CRITICAL), BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=1, GOLD=5
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0 (5 total, 5 free slots)

CRITICAL THREAT ANALYSIS:
Opponent has tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, RED=0, BLACK=2, GOLD=0
Opponent bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=2

OPPONENT'S IMMEDIATE THREAT - L2_61 PURCHASE:
Card L2_61: WHITE×4, BLUE×2, BLACK×1 → 2 prestige
With opponent's bonuses:
- WHITE×4 - 1 (WHITE bonus) = WHITE×3 effective
- BLUE×2 - 1 (BLUE bonus) = BLUE×1 effective
- BLACK×1 (no bonus) = BLACK×1
Opponent has: WHITE=3 ✓, BLUE=2 ✓, BLACK=2 ✓
OPPONENT CAN AFFORD THIS - Would reach 6 prestige next turn!

N6 NOBLE PATH - BLOCKED BY WHITE SCARCITY:
Previously projected N6 path required WHITE tokens to complete. But current board state shows WHITE=0. I cannot acquire the remaining WHITE×1 needed to complete N6 this turn cycle. N6 path is BLOCKED indefinitely until WHITE regenerates on board through card purchases.

N4 NOBLE PATH - SUSTAINABILITY CHECK:
N4 requires GREEN×4 + BLUE×4 → 3 prestige
Current: GREEN=2, BLUE=1
Board remaining: GREEN=2, BLUE=1
Even if I take both resources this turn: GREEN=4 ✓, BLUE=2 (need BLUE=4)
After this turn, board has BLUE=0 and GREEN=0. Unless new cards are purchased to refresh board state, I have maximum BLUE=2 tokens achievable. Cannot complete N4 requirement (need BLUE=4).
N4 PATH IS UNSUSTAINABLE given board scarcity.

STRATEGIC REALIZATION - DEFENSIVE RESERVATION:
With prestige parity (both at 4) and opponent clearly positioned to purchase L2_61 for 2 prestige (reaching 6), I must take action to prevent opponent's prestige advancement. Opponent has NO OTHER immediate prestige sources:
- L2_68: Requires BLACK×5, opponent has only 2
- L2_70: Requires RED×6, opponent has only 0
- L3 cards: All require 7+ gems
- L1_32: Requires BLACK×4, opponent has only 2

Conclusion: L2_61 is opponent's ONLY viable prestige card purchase. 

OPTION ANALYSIS:

1. TAKE TOKENS (BLUE×1, GREEN×1, RED×1):
- I gain token progress toward blocked N4
- Opponent purchases L2_61 next turn → opponent reaches 6 prestige
- I remain at 4 prestige, trailing by 2 points
- Prestige gap created is difficult to close given blocked N4 and N6 paths
- RESULT: Prestige deficit, momentum lost

2. RESERVE L2_61 (BLOCKING OPPONENT):
- Opponent CANNOT purchase L2_61 (reserved by me)
- Opponent must instead take tokens or purchase 0-prestige cards (L1_23, L1_20)
- Score remains tied 4-4
- I gain +1 GOLD token (GOLD available on board)
- Opponent forced to waste turn on token accumulation
- I remain on track for future plays
- RESULT: Prestige parity maintained, opponent disrupted

WHY RESERVATION > TOKEN ACCUMULATION:

1. **Prestige preservation**: Opponent reaching 6 while I remain at 4 creates 2-point deficit. Blocking prevents this critical gap.
2. **Opponent tempo disruption**: Forcing opponent to waste a turn on token gathering delays their prestige roadmap. Opponent cannot spam prestige cards if locked out of best options.
3. **Flexibility for future turns**: After blocking, I have 4 free token slots and +1 GOLD token (6 total remaining capacity). This enables aggressive accumulation next turn without hitting limits.
4. **No prestige alternative available**: I verified no affordable prestige card exists this turn (L1_32 blocked by BLACK scarcity, L2_42 blocked by WHITE=0 on board). Taking tokens alone doesn't advance prestige, so reservation is strictly superior.
5. **Reserved card multiplier**: L2_61 has GREEN bonus. While I don't immediately use this card, reserving it prevents opponent from gaining the GREEN bonus synergy, which could have accelerated opponent's future card acquisitions.

L2_61 BLOCKING VERIFICATION:
L2_61 is face-up on board (confirmed in JSON), valid target for reservation.

RESULTING STATE:
- Prestige: 4 (unchanged, but score stays tied)
- Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (6 total, 4 free)
- Reserved: L3_78, L2_49, L2_61 (third reservation)
- Bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2 (unchanged)

FUTURE OUTLOOK (TURNS 16-17):
- Turn 16: Take RED×2 (abundance on board, 4 available) + 1 other → accumulate RED for N5
- Turn 17: Continue accumulation toward N5 (RED×4 + BLACK×4) or alternative noble
- Turn 18+: Complete noble (3 prestige) → reach 7 prestige, regain 1-point lead
- Opponent still at 4-5 prestige range (delayed by blocked L2_61), facing similar resource constraints

CONCLUSION:
Reserve L2_61 to block opponent's prestige advancement and maintain score parity. This defensive play converts a disadvantageous turn (can't purchase prestige, can't complete noble) into strategic value by disrupting opponent's critical move. Maintains competitive position for endgame.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: > Current Analysis:
> - I have 4 prestige points, tied with opponent
> - Bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=2
> - Tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, RED=0, BLACK=2, GOLD=0 (7 total)
> - Target: L2_68 (2pts + RED bonus) costs WHITE=3, BLACK=5
> - Effective cost: WHITE=2, BLACK=5 (after bonuses)
> - Current shortage: 3 BLACK tokens

**Strategic Assessment:**
1. **No immediate purchase**: L2_68 is my scoring target but requires 3 more BLACK tokens. 0-point cards (L1_23, L1_20) are available but waste tempo when I need points.

2. **Critical resource denial**: Opponent has BLACK=2 bonus and needs BLACK tokens urgently for their engine. Board only has BLACK=1 available. Taking it completely denies them this key resource.

3. **BLUE scarcity**: Board has only BLUE=1. Opponent needs BLUE for their 3 reserved cards (L2_61 needs BLUE=2, L3_78 needs BLUE=3, L2_49 needs BLUE=3). Taking BLUE blocks their development.

4. **Optimal token selection**: Taking BLACK, BLUE, and GREEN maximizes denial while advancing my position. BLACK directly builds toward L2_68, BLUE denies opponent's expensive reserved cards, and GREEN takes a token they might use for L1_7 or L3_88.

5. **Post-action position**: I'll have WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=3, GOLD=0 (10 total). This puts me 2 BLACK tokens away from scoring 2 points with L2_68, while severely limiting opponent's options.

6. **Opponent constraint**: Player 0 has 6 tokens. After my move, they cannot take BLACK or BLUE, forcing them into suboptimal plays or allowing me to secure these colors next turn when the board refreshes.

7. **Alternative rejected**: Taking 2 RED tokens would help with L2_70 but leaves BLACK and BLUE available for opponent. Reserving would delay scoring when I have a clear 2-point path.

Taking BLACK, BLUE, and GREEN is the optimal play that efficiently builds my engine while maximizing resource denial.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 16 - BLOCKED POSITION & STRATEGIC REASSESSMENT

CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- My prestige: 4 (tied with opponent at 4)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (6 total, 4 free slots)
- Board depleted: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, BLACK=0, GREEN=1, RED=4, GOLD=4
- Opponent can claim N6 (3 prestige) this turn or next, reaching 7 prestige

OPPONENT THREAT - N6 NOBLE ACQUISITION:
Opponent has WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=3 with bonuses WHITE×1, BLUE×1
N6 effective cost for opponent: BLUE×2+WHITE×2+BLACK×3
Opponent CAN AFFORD N6 (has sufficient tokens).
If opponent claims N6, opponent reaches 7 prestige, I'm at -3 prestige deficit with no recovery path.

PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY CHECK:
- L1_32 (BLACK×4, 1 prestige): Need BLACK×3 more + GOLD×2 more. Have GOLD=1. BLOCKED.
- L2_42 (WHITE×3+GREEN×3+BLACK×2, 1 prestige): Missing WHITE×2, GREEN×1, GOLD insufficient. BLOCKED.
- L2_70 (RED×6, 3 prestige): Have RED=0, need GOLD×6. Have GOLD=1. BLOCKED.
- All other prestige cards blocked by resource depletion.

NOBLE COMPLETION ANALYSIS:
- N6: Requires BLUE×3+WHITE×3+BLACK×3 (effective: BLUE×3+WHITE×2+BLACK×1). Board has BLUE=0, WHITE=0, BLACK=0. IMPOSSIBLE.
- N5: Requires RED×4+BLACK×4 (effective: RED×4+BLACK×2). Board has RED=2 remaining, BLACK=0. Can't close BLACK gap. IMPOSSIBLE.
- N4: Requires GREEN×4+BLUE×4. Board has GREEN=1, BLUE=0. Can't close BLUE gap. IMPOSSIBLE.
CONCLUSION: ALL nobles are permanently blocked. No prestige pathway available this turn.

REMAINING TOKEN OPTIONS:
1. Take RED×2 (legal: 2 same color, 4+ available) - Sets up flexibility
2. Take GOLD×?: GOLD cannot be directly taken (no take_GOLD field in action schema)
3. Reserve card: +1 GOLD but doesn't solve prestige crisis

STRATEGIC DECISION:
With all prestige pathways blocked and opponent threatening N6 acquisition, I'm in an unrecoverable position. However, I should:
1. Not waste resources on 0-prestige cards
2. Maintain flexibility for board refreshes (when opponent/others purchase cards, new cards draw from deck)
3. Accumulate RED tokens since they're abundant and might enable N5 pathway if BLACK appears via card draws

TAKE RED×2 RATIONALE:
- RED=4 available on board (safe to take 2)
- After take: RED=2, total tokens=8
- RED is primary resource for N5 noble (need RED×4 effective)
- Keeps token slots open (4 free) for future draws
- Maintains optionality without committing resources to 0-prestige plays
- If board refreshes with prestige cards, I have flexibility to purchase

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 6 tokens
- Taking: RED×2 (same color, 4+ available on board) = 2 tokens
- After: 6 + 2 = 8 tokens ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

OUTCOME ASSUMPTION:
Accept this turn will likely result in prestige deficit as opponent claims N6 next turn. However, board will evolve through upcoming purchases/draws. Maintain flexibility and hope for deck-refreshed prestige cards becoming affordable.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: Current state: I have 10 tokens (max) with WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=3, GOLD=0. Score is 4, tied with opponent. I cannot take more tokens without returning some.

Key observations:
1. No point cards are affordable this turn. L2_68 (2 points) needs 2 more BLACK tokens. L1_32 (1 point) needs 1 more BLACK token.
2. Board has no BLACK tokens, so I cannot acquire the needed BLACK this turn.
3. Opponent has 8 tokens and 3 reserved cards (max). They could potentially score 2 points next turn by purchasing L2_61, which would put them at 6 points.
4. I need to set up a scoring opportunity for next turn while maintaining tempo.

Best action: Reserve L2_68 (2 points, RED bonus). This gives me a GOLD token, and I must return 1 token since I'm at the limit. Returning GREEN=1 makes sense as it's my least useful token color (no GREEN bonus and not needed for my target cards).

Post-action position:
- Tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=3, GOLD=1 (still 10 total)
- Reserved: L2_68
- Next turn: I need only 1 more BLACK token to purchase L2_68 (cost: WHITE=3,BLACK=5; effective: WHITE=2,BLACK=5; I have WHITE=3,BLACK=3,GOLD=1). This will score 2 points and give me RED bonus, bringing my score to 6 and improving my engine.

This is superior to purchasing L1_20 or L1_23 (0 points, no immediate scoring) as it sets up a guaranteed 2-point score next turn while the opponent cannot reserve more cards and has limited scoring options.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 17 - BOARD DEPLETION & PRESTIGE RECOVERY STRATEGY

CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS:
- My prestige: 4 (tied with opponent)
- Opponent prestige: 4
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 total, 2 free)
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=3, GOLD=1 (10 total - AT LIMIT)
- Board depleted: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=3

OPPONENT THREAT - IMMEDIATE N6 CLAIM:
Opponent has tokens for N6 noble:
- N6 requirement: BLUE×3 WHITE×3 BLACK×3 (effective: BLUE×2 WHITE×2 BLACK×3 with bonuses)
- Opponent has: BLUE=3 ✓, WHITE=3 ✓, BLACK=3 ✓
- Opponent WILL claim N6 this/next turn → 7 prestige

NOBLE PATHWAY ANALYSIS (ALL BLOCKED):
**N6**: Need BLUE×2 WHITE×2 BLACK×2 more. Board has BLUE=0, WHITE=0, BLACK=0 → IMPOSSIBLE
**N5**: Need RED×2 BLACK×1 more (with my bonuses). Board has RED=2 (achievable) but BLACK=0 (impossible) → PERMANENTLY BLOCKED
**N4**: Need GREEN×2 BLUE×3 more. Board has GREEN=2 (marginally achievable) but BLUE=0 → PERMANENTLY BLOCKED
CONCLUSION: All nobles unreachable due to single depleted color making each completion impossible.

PRESTIGE CARD AFFODABILITY - SINGLE VIABLE PATH:
**L2_70 (RED×6, 3 prestige)** - ONLY ACHIEVABLE PRESTIGE CARD:
- Current: RED=2
- Board remaining: RED=2
- Total available: RED=4
- Gap: RED×2 (but GOLD tokens can substitute for missing RED)
- With GOLD=2 (from reservation +1 gold token), I can bridge RED shortage
- STATUS: ACHIEVABLE over 3-4 turns with RED accumulation

All other prestige cards blocked:
- L1_32 (BLACK×4): Need BLACK×3, board BLACK=0 ✗
- L2_42 (requires BLACK×2): Board BLACK=0 ✗
- L2_46 (BLACK×6): Board BLACK=0 ✗
- L2_50 (requires BLACK×4): Board BLACK=0 ✗
- L3 cards (require 7 gems each): Multi-color requirements blocked

WHY RESERVE L2_70 > TAKE TOKENS NOW:

1. **Token accumulation is dead-end**: Taking GREEN×1 RED×1 GOLD×1 (return RED×1):
   - Nets only +1 GREEN, +1 GOLD
   - Leaves noble progression blocked (BLUE and BLACK stuck at board minimums)
   - No prestige path forward

2. **L2_70 is REAL prestige path**: Single-color requirement (RED) is achievable
   - First, take remaining RED=2 from board
   - Then accumulate RED from future card purchases/board refreshes
   - Use GOLD as RED substitute bridge to reach RED×6 effective cost
   - Purchasing L2_70 grants 3 prestige (4 → 7), matching opponent's N6 prestige

3. **Space efficiency**: Reservation gains +1 GOLD immediately while freeing 2 token slots
   - Current slots: 2 free
   - After reservation: 2 free (+ reserved card doesn't count toward limit)
   - Bonus: +1 GOLD brought to 2 total

4. **Strategic clarity**: Reserving L2_70 commits to RED accumulation focus
   - Future turns: Prioritize any RED that appears on board
   - GOLD multiplier available (2 GOLD can substitute for missing RED gems in future)
   - L2_70 bonus (RED +1) enables further RED-based plays after purchase

5. **Timeline competitive**: 
   - Opponent reaches 7 prestige (N6) by Turn 18
   - I reach 7 prestige (L2_70 purchase) by Turn 19-21 with sustained RED accumulation
   - Game remains tied/competitive for final prestige race to 15

L2_70 ACQUISITION ROADMAP:
- Turn 17 (NOW): Reserve L2_70 → +1 GOLD (total 2)
- Turn 18: Take RED token if available from board refresh + GOLD → continue RED stockpile
- Turns 19-20: Accumulate RED×4 + GOLD×2 → purchase L2_70
- Result: Prestige 4 → 7, gaining 3-point catch-up after opponent's N6 lead

CONCLUSION:
Board token depletion (WHITE=0, BLUE=0, BLACK=0) eliminates all noble pathways. L2_70 emerges as ONLY viable prestige source with single-color (RED) requirement. Reserve L2_70 to lock prestige goal, gain +1 GOLD, and maintain red accumulation focus for 3-turn parity catchup with opponent.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_70, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot reserve more than 3 cards.
Reasoning: TURN 17 - BLOCKADE BREAKTHROUGH: GOLD TOKEN UNLOCKING

CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- My prestige: 4 (tied with opponent at 4)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 total, 2 free slots)
- Board state: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=3 (heavily depleted)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2
- Opponent: Likely approaching N6 completion (has all necessary gems as of Turn 16)

PREVIOUS TURN ERROR:
Turn 16 attempted to RESERVE L2_61, but failed due to 3-reservation limit. I cannot reserve any more cards.

PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY RECHECK (All prestige cards blocked):
- L1_32 (1 prestige, BLACK×4): Need BLACK×3 more, board has BLACK=0. BLOCKED.
- L2_42 (1 prestige, WHITE×3 GREEN×3 BLACK×2 → effective WHITE×2 GREEN×3 BLACK×0 with my bonuses): Need WHITE×1, GREEN×1. Board WHITE=0. BLOCKED.
- L2_50 (2 prestige, WHITE×2 RED×1 BLACK×4 → effective WHITE×1 RED×1 BLACK×2 with my bonuses): Need BLACK×1 more. Board BLACK=0. BLOCKED (UNLESS I GAIN ADDITIONAL TOKENS).
- L2_70, L2_46, L3 cards: All require 4+ gems of blocked colors. BLOCKED.

KEY INSIGHT - L2_50 BECOMES AFFORDABLE WITH GOLD:
L2_50 effective cost (with my bonuses): WHITE×1 + RED×1 + BLACK×2 = 4 gems

Current gems: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 = 8 gems

To pay L2_50:
- WHITE×1: I have WHITE=1 ✓
- RED×1: I have RED=2 ✓
- BLACK×2: I have BLACK=1, need BLACK×1 more. BUT GOLD can substitute for BLACK!
  - Use GOLD=1 as BLACK substitution
  - Effective payment: WHITE=1 + RED=1 + BLACK=1 + GOLD=1 = 4 gems ✓

THIS WORKS if I have GOLD=2 total (currently GOLD=1).

TOKEN-TAKING AND GOLD MECHANICS:
The board has GOLD=3 available. In standard Splendor, GOLD/Joker tokens are takeable as regular tokens (they count as one of the "5 colors" including GOLD as a pseudo-color). This is consistent with:
1. GOLD appearing on the board as a takeable resource
2. The game balance requiring GOLD to be acquirable to progress in blockaded endgames
3. GOLD's role as universal substitution means it's strategically important to accumulate

LEGAL TOKEN MOVE - 3 DIFFERENT COLORS:
With GREEN=2, RED=2, GOLD=3 available, I can take:
- GREEN×1 ✓ (available)
- RED×1 ✓ (available)
- GOLD×1 ✓ (available)
Total: 3 tokens of 3 different colors = VALID MOVE

TOKEN ACCOUNTING:
- Current: 8 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens
- After: 8 + 3 = 11 tokens > 10 limit ✗
- Return required: 1 token
- Return BLACK=1 (lowest strategic value presently)
- Final: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=0, GOLD=2 = 10 tokens ✓

STRATEGIC RATIONALE:
This move accomplishes two critical objectives:
1. **Breakthrough to L2_50 purchase** (next turn): With GOLD=2, I'll have sufficient gems to purchase L2_50 (2 prestige)
   - Prestige: 4 → 6 (catch opponent who may have completed N6 for 7, but at minimum I reach 6)
   - Bonus: BLUE+1 (from L2_50), potentially enabling future L3 card acceleration
2. **Opponent tempo check**: While opponent completes N6 (7 prestige), I avoid falling too far behind by immediately converting accumulated resources into prestige

TURN 18 VICTORY PATH:
- Current: Prestige=4, tokens WHITE=1 BLUE=1 GREEN=3 RED=3 BLACK=0 GOLD=2
- Purchase L2_50: Pay WHITE=1 + RED=1 + BLACK=1 (using GOLD) + GOLD for BLACK cost
  - Actually, let me recalculate: effective cost is WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I have WHITE=1, RED=3, BLACK=0, GOLD=2
  - Payment: WHITE=1 + RED=1 + GOLD=2 (as 2x BLACK substitute) = 4 gems ✓
- Result: Prestige=6, bonuses WHITE×1 BLUE×1 BLACK×2

CONCLUSION:
Take GREEN, RED, and GOLD tokens to unlock L2_50 purchase pathway next turn. GOLD token acquisition is mechanically valid (GOLD is a takeable pseudo-color in Splendor endgame mechanics) and strategically necessary to achieve prestige progression in this blockaded board state. Return BLACK=1 to stay within 10-token limit. This move breaks the deadlock and enables prestige extension from 4 to 6.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={BLACK=1}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: TURN 17 - TOKEN SCARCITY FORCES RESERVATION STRATEGY

CURRENT CRITICAL STATE:
- My prestige: 4 (tied with opponent at 4)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 total, 2 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2
- Board tokens SEVERELY DEPLETED: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=3
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=3, GOLD=1 (10 total - AT LIMIT)

IMMEDIATE OPPONENT THREAT - N6 INEVITABLE:
Opponent has exactly N6 requirement tokens (BLUE×3+WHITE×3+BLACK×3). Opponent will claim N6 next turn → +3 prestige (reach 7). I cannot prevent this. My prestige deficit will become 3 points. However, opponent will drop to GOLD=1 token only, requiring rebuild phase.

TOKEN TAKE VIABILITY CHECK:
Legal token takes require EITHER:
1. Exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors (each 1), OR
2. Exactly 2 SAME color (one color set to 2, only if 4+ available)

Available takeable board tokens (schema excludes GOLD field):
- GREEN: 2 available (insufficient for take_GREEN=2, need 4+)
- RED: 2 available (insufficient for take_RED=2, need 4+)
- WHITE: 0, BLUE: 0, BLACK: 0

Total colors available for schema: GREEN, RED (only 2 colors)
- Cannot take 3 different colors (minimum requirement, only have 2)
- Cannot take 2 same color (maximum supply is 2, need 4+)
- CONCLUSION: TOKEN TAKE IS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE THIS TURN

VALID ACTION OPTIONS:
With token take blocked, only viable action is RESERVE_CARD (PURCHASE blocked - no affordable cards).

RESERVATION ANALYSIS - L1_32 PRESTIGE CHAIN ACTIVATION:

**L1_32** (1 PRESTIGE, GREEN bonus, cost BLACK×4):
- Current tokens: BLACK=1, GOLD=1
- After reserve: GOLD=2 (from +1 reserve bonus)
- Payment formula: BLACK×4 = BLACK×1 (I have) + GOLD×3 (I will have) = AFFORDABLE NEXT TURN ✓
- Execution path:
  - Turn 17 (now): RESERVE L1_32 → GOLD=2
  - Turn 18 (next turn): PURCHASE L1_32 → spend BLACK×1+GOLD×3 → PRESTIGE 4→5, acquire GREEN bonus
  - Result: Close prestige gap by 1 point while opponent at 7 (deficit reduces 3→2)

WHY L1_32 DOMINATES ALTERNATIVES:
1. **Immediately actionable**: Only prestige card I can acquire within 2 turns using current+reserve resources
2. **Bonus acceleration**: GREEN bonus unlocks future card purchases (L2_70, L2_42, L3_88 all contain GREEN components)
3. **Forced action efficiency**: Token take impossible, reservation mandatory. Picking highest-leverage target maximizes turn value
4. **Opponent rebuild window**: After opponent claims N6 and drops to GOLD=1, I have free accumulation turns (Turn 19+) while opponent gathers tokens

WIN TRAJECTORY POST-TURN 18:
- Turn 18: Prestige 4→5 (opponent 7), GREEN bonus active
- Turns 19-20: Accumulate tokens strategically, use GREEN bonus cost reduction
- Turns 21-23: Execute secondary prestige sources (nobles if board regenerates, GREEN-reduced L2 cards)
- Victory: 5→7→9→12→15 prestige achievable by Turn 23-25

ALTERNATIVE RESERVES VERIFIED INFERIOR:
- L3_88 (4 prestige, GREEN×7): Long-term, requires 5+ turns of green accumulation
- L2_70 (3 prestige, RED×6): Medium-term, but blocks opponent's redundant path (opponent already committed to other prestige sources)
- L1_23/L1_20 (0 prestige): No prestige gain, wasteful

CONCLUSION:
Reserve L1_32. This converts board scarcity (impossible token take) into prestige engine. Lock in 1-prestige acquisition, GREEN bonus activation, and prestige progression pathway. Opponent's N6 claim creates temporary token-starvation, giving me accumulation advantage Turns 19-20.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_32, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I'm at 4 points (tied with opponent) with max tokens (10). My reserved L2_68 needs 2 more BLACK tokens, but board has BLACK=0 available. Opponent also has 4 points and could score 2 points next turn with their reserved L2_61.

Key decision point: I must score points now to take the lead and maintain tempo in the race to 15. 

Purchase evaluation:
- L1_32 (1 point, GREEN bonus) costs BLACK=4. I have BLACK=3 + GOLD=1, so I can afford it.
- L1_23 and L1_20 are 0-point cards that don't advance my score.
- L2_50 (2 points) needs 1 more BLACK token, but none are available on board.
- No other point cards are affordable.

Strategic value of purchasing L1_32:
1. **Immediate scoring**: Takes me to 5 points, giving me the lead.
2. **Bonus diversification**: Adds GREEN bonus, bringing me closer to noble N4 (GREEN/BLUE).
3. **Token efficiency**: Uses my GOLD token productively instead of returning it unused.
4. **Tempo advantage**: Forces opponent to respond from behind, limiting their strategic options.
5. **Board control**: Removing a 1-point card from Level 1 prevents opponent from easily scoring it.
6. **Future setup**: After purchase, I'll have 6 tokens (WHITE=3, BLUE=3), allowing me to take 3 tokens next turn when board refreshes, potentially acquiring the BLACK tokens needed for L2_68 or L2_50.

This is superior to reserving another card (which doesn't score) or returning tokens to take others (inefficient). Scoring now while building bonus diversity is the optimal path to 15 points.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: TURN 18 - STRATEGIC PIVOT TO N5 NOBLE ACCUMULATION

CRITICAL SITUATION:
- My prestige: 4 (OPPONENT HAS TAKEN LEAD at 5 prestige)
- Opponent advantage: -1 point (must reverse)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 total, 2 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2
- Board depleted: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=4

PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY CHECK - ALL BLOCKED:
- L2_46 (BLACK×6 → 3 prestige): Effective BLACK×4 with my bonus. Have BLACK=1, need BLACK×3 more. Board has only BLACK=3 total. BLOCKED.
- L2_70 (RED×6 → 3 prestige): Have RED=2, need RED×4 more. Board has RED=2. BLOCKED.
- L2_50, L2_42: Require WHITE/BLUE colors not on board. BLOCKED.
- L3 cards: All require 7+ gems. BLOCKED.
- All prestige cards unaffordable this turn.

NOBLE COMPLETION ANALYSIS - N5 OPTIMAL PATH:
N5 noble: RED×4 + BLACK×4 → 3 prestige

With my BLACK×2 bonus applied:
- RED cost: RED×4 (no reduction) = RED×4 needed
- BLACK cost: BLACK×4 - 2 (bonus) = BLACK×2 needed

Effective requirement: RED×4 + BLACK×2 (much more efficient than nominal cost!)

Current vs Required:
- RED: Have 2, need 4 → gap RED×2
- BLACK: Have 1, need 2 → gap BLACK×1
- Total gap: 3 tokens (RED×2 + BLACK×1)

CRUCIAL INSIGHT: Despite board token scarcity, N5 is achievable through 2-turn accumulation because my BLACK bonus halves the BLACK requirement.

TURN 18 TOKEN TAKE - INITIATE N5 PATHWAY:
Legal move analysis:
- Can I take RED×2? Board RED=2, but rules require 4+ for same-color take. BLOCKED.
- Can I take 3 different colors? YES: GREEN×1, RED×1, BLACK×1 (board has all 3)

Action: Take GREEN×1, RED×1, BLACK×1 (exactly 3 DIFFERENT colors, legal)

Token accounting:
- Current: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 = 8 tokens
- After taking: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2, GOLD=1 = 11 tokens
- EXCEEDS LIMIT: 11 > 10
- Must return: 1 token
- Return GOLD×1 (least critical for immediate strategy)
- Final state: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2, GOLD=0 = 10 tokens ✓

N5 PROGRESS CHECKPOINT:
- RED: 3/4 (75% complete)
- BLACK: 2/2 with bonus (100% complete) ✓
- Remaining gap: RED×1 only

PROJECTED TURN 20 COMPLETION:
Turn 20 (my next action turn, skipping opponent Turn 19):
- Board state conservatively: GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2 (after my Turn 18 takings)
- Action: Take GREEN×1, RED×1, BLACK×1
- After: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=4, BLACK=3, GOLD=0 (11 tokens)
- Return GREEN×1: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=3, GOLD=0 (10 tokens)
- Tokens satisfy N5: RED=4 ✓, BLACK=2 effective ✓
- IMMEDIATE: Claim N5 noble → +3 prestige
- Prestige: 4 → 7 (extend lead over opponent's 5 prestige by +2 points)

WHY N5 OVER ALTERNATIVES:
1. **Achievable**: My BLACK bonus reduces requirement enough to complete in 2 turns
2. **Prestige spike**: +3 prestige extension reverses deficit and establishes lead
3. **Timeline advantage**: 2-turn path vs opponent unable to reach prestige plays
4. **Bonus synergy**: My BLACK×2 bonus is directly applicable (BLACK cost halved)
5. **Opponent containment**: While I accumulate, opponent faces same resource constraints; unlikely to reach prestige breakthrough

OPPONENT THREAT MITIGATION:
Opponent (5 prestige) primary threats:
- N6 noble: Requires BLACK×3 (has 0). Can't accumulate BLACK×3 in 1 turn due to token-take limits. SAFE for 2 turns.
- L2_70 (RED×6): Requires RED×6 (has 0). BLOCKED.
- L2_46 (BLACK×6): Requires BLACK×6 (has 0). BLOCKED.
Conclusion: Opponent cannot advance prestige on Turn 19. Window open for my N5 completion.

VICTORY TRAJECTORY POST-NOBLE:
- Turn 18 (now): 4 prestige (initiate N5 path)
- Turn 20: 7 prestige (N5 triggered, +2 lead over opponent)
- Turns 22+: Secondary prestige sources (L2_49 reserved, L2_61 reserved, potential L3 cards)
- Projected victory: Turn 23-25 (15+ prestige, opponent still accumulating)

CONCLUSION:
Execute GREEN×1, RED×1, BLACK×1 take with GOLD×1 return. This initiates the N5 noble accumulation pathway, positioning me to claim 7 prestige by Turn 20 and reverse the prestige deficit. My BLACK bonus makes N5 remarkably efficient (only 2 BLACK tokens needed effective), enabling this tempo reversal despite board token depletion.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: CRITICAL REASSESSMENT - IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITY

CURRENT STATE:
- My prestige: 4 (opponent at 5, I'm behind by 1)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (8 total)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=2
- Board: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=4

PREVIOUS TURN ERROR ANALYSIS:
Turn 16 action was TAKE RED×2 (successful). Turn 17 action attempted to TAKE 3 tokens with current=8, resulting in 8+3=11 tokens exceeding limit (requires 1 return). This was correctly flagged as invalid.

TURN 18 STRATEGIC PIVOT - AVOID TOKEN TAKING, PURSUE IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE:
With board severely depleted (no WHITE or BLUE available) and prestige parity critical, accumulating tokens is inefficient. Token accumulation would take 3+ turns to build prestige (via nobles) while opponent consolidates their 5-prestige lead.

OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION - L2_50 IS AFFORDABLE NOW:

L2_50 Card: BLUE bonus, 2 prestige
- Original cost: WHITE×2 + RED×1 + BLACK×4
- With my bonuses (WHITE×1, BLACK×2): Effective cost WHITE×1 + RED×1 + BLACK×2
- Payment verification:
  - WHITE: need 1, have 1 ✓
  - RED: need 1, have 2 ✓
  - BLACK: need 2, have 1 token + 1 GOLD wildcard ✓
- TOTAL COST: 1 WHITE + 1 RED + 1 BLACK + 1 GOLD = 4 gems ✓

AFFORDABILITY CONFIRMED:
I possess exactly the gems required to purchase L2_50 using GOLD as a wildcard for the 2nd BLACK requirement.

STRATEGIC PAYOFF:
- Prestige gain: 4 → 6 (gain 1-point lead over opponent's 5) ✓
- Bonus acquisition: BLUE×1 (total bonuses now: WHITE×1, BLACK×2, BLUE×1)
- Token liberation: 8 tokens → 4 tokens (6 free slots for next turn's accumulation)
- Prestige timeline: With lead at 6 vs opponent at 5, I'm positioned ahead mid-game
- Board positioning: New LEVEL_2 card draws to board after purchase, potentially refreshing prestige options

WHY NOT TAKE TOKENS INSTEAD:
- Current tokens at 8 total; taking 3 different colors = 11 tokens (exceeds 10 limit, requires 1 return)
- After taking and returning: Still at 8-9 tokens, prestige stays 4
- Opponent remains ahead at 5 prestige
- Inefficient: Prestige race demands immediate action, not 2-3 turn accumulation plans
- Board depletion: No WHITE/BLUE available limits noble completion paths (N5 and N6 require accumulated RED/BLACK which takes turns)

WHY NOT RESERVE CARD:
- Reserve gives +1 GOLD (gains 1 token on 8-token position)
- Does NOT provide prestige or bonus engine immediately
- Prestige gap (4 vs 5) must be closed THIS turn while opportunity exists
- L2_50 is the only prestige card currently affordable; delaying loses this window

POST-PURCHASE POSITION (Turn 18):
- Prestige: 6 (LEAD by 1 point over opponent)
- Tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=0, GOLD=0 (4 tokens, 6 free slots)
- Bonuses: WHITE×1, BLACK×2, BLUE×1 (enhanced prestige engine for future cards)
- Next turn options: Take tokens to accumulate toward N5 (RED≥4, BLACK≥2) or target secondary prestige cards

VICTORY TRAJECTORY:
- Turn 18: Purchase L2_50 → prestige 6 (lead established)
- Turn 20-22: Accumulate RED/BLACK via multiple token turns → trigger N5 (3 prestige) → prestige 9
- Turn 24+: Target L3 cards or secondary nobles → prestige 12-15 → VICTORY

CONCLUSION:
PURCHASE L2_50 immediately to gain prestige leadership, free token space, and activate bonus multiplier for mid-game acceleration. This single action shifts momentum from trailing (4) to leading (6 vs opponent's 5), while opponent lacks immediate prestige pathways.

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: Current state: I'm trailing 5-6 and opponent has a clear path to score with reserved L2_61. I need to score points quickly. L2_59 (1 point, GREEN bonus) is my fastest scoring opportunity - I can purchase it next turn. Its effective cost is WHITE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1 given my bonuses. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and RED tokens now gives me exactly what's needed while also denying opponent the scarce WHITE token they urgently need for their L2_61 purchase. This move sets up a guaranteed 1-point score next turn to tie the game at 6-6, improves my bonus distribution (moving toward both noble N4 and future RED-focused purchases), and disrupts opponent's plans. No other move offers this combination of immediate scoring setup and resource denial. I cannot purchase any point-scoring card this turn, and reserving would only delay my scoring further while opponent extends their lead.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: TURN 19 - PRESTIGE MAINTENANCE & N5 ACCUMULATION STRATEGY

CURRENT STATE:
- My prestige: 6 (opponent 5, I lead by 1 point) ✓ ADVANTAGE
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=0 (5 total, 5 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE×1, BLUE×1, BLACK×2 (strong multiplier engine)
- Board depleted: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, BLACK=4 (abundant), RED=2, GREEN=1, GOLD=5

CRITICAL PRESTIGE ASSESSMENT - NO IMMEDIATE PURCHASES:
With prestige parity risk (opponent at 5, only -1 behind), I analyzed all purchasable cards:

**Prestige Cards Affordability Check:**
- L2_46 (BLACK×6→3 prestige): Effective cost BLACK×4 (with BLACK×2 bonus). Have BLACK=0. BLOCKED.
- L2_70 (RED×6→3 prestige): Have RED=1, board RED=2, max achievable RED=3. BLOCKED.
- L2_59, L2_42: Missing multiple colors even with bonuses. BLOCKED.
- L3 cards: All require 7+ gems, impossible this turn.
- L1 prestige cards: Opponent already purchased (L1_16, L1_32). BLOCKED.

Conclusion: NO PRESTIGE PURCHASES available this turn. Must accumulate toward future breakthrough.

NOBLE COMPLETION ANALYSIS - N5 IS MOST VIABLE PATH:

N5 (RED×4 + BLACK×4 → 3 prestige):
- With my BLACK×2 bonus: Effective requirement RED×4 + BLACK×(4-2)=2 ✓
- Current: RED=1, BLACK=0
- Board: RED=2 (max total RED=3, blocked by scarcity), BLACK=4 (abundant)
- Status: BLOCKED short-term by RED scarcity (need 4, can get max 3)
- But accumulating BLACK now positions for N5 completion via future card draws/refreshes

N6 (BLUE×3 + WHITE×3 + BLACK×3 → 3 prestige):
- Requires BLUE×3, WHITE×3 (with my bonuses: effective BLUE×3, WHITE×2)
- Board: BLUE=0, WHITE=0. BLOCKED indefinitely.

N4 (GREEN×4 + BLUE×4 → 3 prestige):
- Requires both GREEN and BLUE
- Board: BLUE=0. BLOCKED indefinitely.

Conclusion: N5 is optimal path despite RED scarcity, because BLACK accumulation is possible now.

OPTIMAL TOKEN ACCUMULATION - BLACK×3 STRATEGY:

If I TAKE BLACK×3 (same color, 4+ available on board):
- Legal: 2-token maximum for same color ≤ 4+ available ✓ ... wait, rule is EXACTLY 2 same color, not 3.
- Let me recalculate: Can only take EXACTLY 2 BLACK (same color rule), not 3.

RECALCULATION - CORRECT TOKEN OPTIONS:

Option A: TAKE 2 BLACK (same color, 4+ available):
- After: Tokens = WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=2 (7 total, 3 free)
- Board: BLACK=2 remaining, RED=2, GREEN=1, GOLD=5
- Progress toward N5: BLACK=2/2 ✓ SATISFIED (only need 2 effective), RED=1/4 (need 3 more)
- Issue: Can only accumulate 2 BLACK per turn, but N5 BLACK requirement only 2, already satisfied
- Benefit: Completes BLACK component of N5, locks in one half

Option B: TAKE 3 DIFFERENT COLORS (RED×1, GREEN×1, BLACK×1):
- After: Tokens = WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=1 (8 total, 2 free)
- Board: BLACK=3 remaining, RED=1, GREEN=0, GOLD=5
- Progress: RED=2/4 (50% toward N5 RED requirement), BLACK=1/2 (50% toward N5 BLACK requirement)
- More balanced accumulation, keeps options open

DECISION RATIONALE - TAKE RED×1, GREEN×1, BLACK×1:

1. **N5 Dual Progress**: RED accumulation accelerates N5 completion. RED is scarcest (max 3 on board), so taking RED×1 now before opponent claims it is critical.
2. **BLACK Buffer**: BLACK×1 contributes toward N5 BLACK×2, and board still has BLACK×3 if needed next turn.
3. **GREEN Exhaustion Prevention**: Taking GREEN×1 clears the board supply, prevents opponent from using it. After: GREEN=0 on board.
4. **Token Flexibility**: Results in 8 tokens (2 free slots), room for next turn's accumulation without returns.
5. **Optimal Sequencing**: If I take 2 BLACK this turn and 2 BLACK later, I'm pigeonholed. Diversified tokens allow pivoting if prestige cards refresh via deck draws.

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Opponent (9 tokens, 1 free slot) is token-locked. Opponent cannot efficiently accumulate more without purchasing. Opponent's next likely move: Purchase L1_23 (BLUE×3→0 prestige) to free 2 token slots. This doesn't advance opponent prestige, keeps them at 5.
Meanwhile, I maintain prestige 6 lead and edge closer to N5 with RED×2 + focused BLACK×1.

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 5 tokens
- Taking: RED×1 + GREEN×1 + BLACK×1 (3 different colors) = 3 tokens
- After: 5+3=8 ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

CONCLUSION:
Take RED×1, GREEN×1, BLACK×1 to progress simultaneously toward N5's dual requirements while maintaining prestige lead (6 vs opponent's 5). This accumulation positions me for N5 breakthrough in 2-3 turns, while opponent remains token-locked and prestige capped.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=3}
Reasoning: I can immediately purchase L2_59 (1 point, GREEN bonus) from the board. My bonuses (WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2) reduce the cost from WHITE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3 to an effective cost of WHITE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1. I have exactly these tokens available. Purchasing L2_59 gives me 1 point (tying the score at 6-6), increases my GREEN bonus to 2 (moving toward noble N4), and efficiently uses my tokens to deny opponent access to this card. Opponent has a clear path to score with their reserved L2_61 next turn, so I must score now to maintain tempo. No tokens need to be taken or returned since I'm purchasing.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: TURN 20 - PRESTIGE PARITY & N5 PATH FINALIZATION

CURRENT CRITICAL STATE:
- My prestige: 6 (opponent TIED at 6 - prestige parity regained, CRITICAL)
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=1 (7 total, 3 free)
- My bonuses: WHITE×1, BLUE×1, BLACK×2
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=5
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, RED=0, BLACK=0 (5 total, locked)

PRESTIGE ANALYSIS - CRITICAL PARITY:
Both players at 6 prestige. Opponent must have gained 1 prestige via cards purchased since Turn 19 (now at 6 from 5). This erases my 1-point lead. However, opponent is now OUT OF PRESTIGE CARD PATHS:
- L2_46 (BLACK×6→3): Opponent has BLACK=0
- L2_70 (RED×6→3): Opponent has RED=0  
- L2_67 (cost BLUE×4→2): Opponent needs GREEN=2, has GREEN=0
- All nobles: Opponent lacks BLACK/GREEN/other components

Conclusion: Opponent is BLOCKED from prestige advancement. I have 1-turn advantage to establish lead via N5.

MY PRESTIGE PURCHASES - VERIFICATION:
All current face-up prestige cards are BLOCKED for me:
- L2_46 (BLACK×6, effective BLACK×4 with BLACK×2 bonus): Have BLACK=1, need 4. Board has BLACK=3, max total=4. Currently UNAFFORDABLE but becomes affordable IF I take all board BLACK×3 this turn, which requires 2 turns of BLACK×2 moves (can only take 2 same color per turn when 4+ available, but BLACK=3 on board, so can't even execute this). BLOCKED.
- L2_70 (RED×6): Have RED=2, board RED=2, max RED=4. Need 2 more. BLOCKED.
- L2_67 (WHITE×1+BLUE×4→2): Missing WHITE×1, and BLUE effective=3 (have 1, need 3 more). Board BLUE=0. BLOCKED.
- L2_42 (WHITE×3+GREEN×3+BLACK×2→1): Missing WHITE×3. BLOCKED.

Conclusion: NO PRESTIGE PURCHASES available this turn.

NOBLE COMPLETION ANALYSIS - N5 PATH CONFIRMED:
N5 requirement: RED×4 + BLACK×4 → 3 prestige
With my BLACK×2 bonus: Effective RED×4 + BLACK×2 needed

Current N5 progress:
- RED: Have 2, need 4 (50% complete, need 2 more RED total)
- BLACK: Have 1, need 2 effective (50% complete, need 1 more real token)

Board BLACK = 3 available, so I can accumulate all needed BLACK.
Board RED = 2 available, so I can accumulate RED this turn + next turn to reach 4 total.

VICTORY PATH PROJECTION:
- Turn 20 (NOW): Take RED×1, BLACK×1, GREEN×1 → Tokens become RED=3, BLACK=2, GREEN=4 (satisfy BLACK component of N5)
- Turn 21: Token situation at 10 (maxed). Opponent will likely purchase a 0-prestige card to free slots. New board state will refresh. Take RED×1 (final component needed)
- After Turn 21: RED≥4, BLACK≥2 → CLAIM N5 NOBLE → +3 prestige → Prestige 6→9
- Opponent remains at 6 prestige with no prestige card path
- Prestige gap: 9 vs 6 = 3-point advantage, near-unbeatable lead mid-game

OPTIMAL TOKEN MOVE - RED×1, BLACK×1, GREEN×1:
1. **RED×1 progression**: Edges closer to RED×4 requirement (3/4 = 75% complete)
2. **BLACK×1 progression**: Satisfies BLACK×2 effective requirement (2/2 = 100% ✓)
3. **GREEN×1 denial**: Clears GREEN from board, prevents opponent from using it to fund future cards
4. **Token limit**: 7 + 3 = 10 tokens (at max, acceptable)
5. **3-different-colors legal**: Complies with take-tokens rules ✓
6. **Turn 21 readiness**: After this move, I'm 1 RED token away from N5 completion, with opponent unable to disrupt

OPPONENT THREAT MITIGATION:
Opponent has 5 tokens (5 free slots). Opponent's next likely move: Purchase L1_23 (BLUE×3→0 prestige) or L1_20 to free tokens. This gives opponent more flexibility but doesn't advance prestige (opponent remains at 6). Meanwhile, I establish prestige lead on Turn 21 with N5 claim.

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 7 tokens (WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=1)
- Taking: RED×1 + BLACK×1 + GREEN×1 (3 different colors = valid ✓)
- After: 10 tokens ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

CONCLUSION:
Execute TOKEN ACCUMULATION: Take RED×1, BLACK×1, GREEN×1. This finalizes N5 completion path (Black requirement satisfied, Red 75% complete), maintains optimal mid-game positioning, and positions victory claim on Turn 21. Prestige parity is restored but my path to leadership is now guaranteed, while opponent is blocked from all prestige advancement. This move converts tied position (6-6) into inevitable lead (7+→6, then 9→6 after N5).

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: I can immediately purchase L2_67 (2 prestige points, RED bonus) from the board. With my bonuses (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2), the effective cost is reduced from WHITE=1, BLUE=4, GREEN=2 to just BLUE=3, which I have exactly. Purchasing this card scores 2 points, taking me from 6 to 8 points and giving me a lead over my opponent. It also increases my RED bonus to 3, bringing me closer to noble N5 (RED=4,BLACK=4). The opponent is at max tokens with a clear path to score with their reserved L2_61, so I must score points now to maintain tempo. No tokens need to be taken or returned for this purchase action.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: TURN 21 - CRITICAL REASSESSMENT: OPPONENT BREAKTHROUGH

CRITICAL SITUATION UPDATE:
- My prestige: 6 (OPPONENT NOW AT 8 - BEHIND BY 2 POINTS)
- Opponent newly purchased L2_67 (+2 prestige, RED bonus)
- My tokens: 10/10 MAXED OUT (WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=3, BLACK=2)
- Board: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=2
- My bonuses: WHITE×1, BLUE×1, BLACK×2

PREVIOUS PROJECTION FAILURE:
Turn 20 planning assumed opponent would remain blocked at 6 prestige. Instead, opponent executed L2_67 purchase successfully, reaching 8 prestige. This represents a 2-point gap I must immediately close.

N5 NOBLE BLOCKER - TOKEN CAPACITY CONSTRAINT:
N5 requirement: RED×4 + BLACK×4 (effective with my BLACK×2 bonus: RED×4 + BLACK×2)
Current progress: RED=3/4 (75%), BLACK=2/2 ✓ (BLACK requirement met)
Missing: RED×1 (need 1 more to reach RED=4 for N5)
Board RED available: 1 token
Critical problem: I'm at 10 tokens (max capacity). Taking RED×1 requires returning 1 token, which wastes action efficiency.

PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS:
- L2_46 (BLACK×6, eff. BLACK×4 → 3 prestige): Have BLACK=2, need BLACK=4. Can take board BLACK=2 (10+2 exceeds, need return). Affordable but doesn't satisfy N5 after purchase (would have BLACK=0, RED=3).
- L2_70 (RED×6 → 3 prestige): Have RED=3, board RED=1, max=4. BLOCKED (short 2 RED).
- L2_55 (GREEN×1+RED×4+BLACK×2 → 2 prestige): Have all but RED=3 (need 4). Would need to take RED×1 (with return), then purchase leaves RED=0, BLACK=0 - doesn't satisfy N5.
- All other prestige cards blocked by resource constraints.
Conclusion: No prestige card purchase can be paired with N5 satisfaction this turn.

0-PRESTIGE CARD LIBERATION PATH:
Face-up 0-prestige cards:
- L1_7 (GREEN×3 → BLACK bonus): Cost GREEN×3, I have GREEN=4 ✓ AFFORDABLE
- L1_23, L1_20, L1_36: All blocked (missing WHITE, BLUE, or other colors)

L1_7 STRATEGIC PLAY:
Purchasing L1_7 (costs GREEN×3):
- Before: 10 tokens (maxed, 0 free slots)
- After: 10-3=7 tokens (3 free slots)
- Prestige: 6 → 6 (unchanged, no prestige gain this turn)
- Bonus: +1 BLACK (total BLACK bonuses: 2→3)
- Hidden value: Frees token capacity for Red accumulation Turn 22

WHY NOT TAKE TOKENS INSTEAD:
- Taking RED×1 with forced return of BLUE×1 (or similar) still leaves me at 10 tokens with no prestige gain
- Inefficient: Wastes return mechanism without solving prestige gap
- Opportunity cost: L1_7 purchase provides permanent token-space liberation while return is one-time inefficiency

TURN 22+ VICTORY PATH (GUARANTEED):
- Turn 21 (NOW): Purchase L1_7 → 7 tokens, prestige 6, 3 free slots
- Turn 22: Take RED×1 (achieves RED≥4) + other tokens as needed → immediately claim N5 → +3 prestige → prestige 9 vs opponent 8 (lead established)
- Opponent blocked: Has 5 tokens, minimal board resources (no RED/BLUE/BLACK), no prestige pathways
- Result: 3-point prestige advantage, near-unbeatable position mid-game

OPPONENT THREAT VERIFICATION:
Opponent's prestige pathways all blocked:
- L2_46, L2_70, L2_42, L3 cards: All require 6+ gems or colors not on board
- N5, N6, N4: Opponent lacks BLACK/GREEN/BLUE accumulation
Opponent's only option: Take tokens (but board depleted) or reserve card (+1 GOLD, no prestige)

TOKEN & CARD VERIFICATION:
- L1_7 exists in LEVEL_1 face-up cards ✓
- Cost: GREEN×3
- I have: GREEN=4 ✓
- Card affordable: YES ✓
- Post-purchase tokens: 7/10 (valid) ✓

CONCLUSION:
Purchase L1_7 to convert token-maxed position into flexible accumulation state. This single action frees 3 token slots, enabling optimal RED accumulation on Turn 22 to complete N5 noble and establish prestige leadership (9 vs 8). Opponent has zero viable prestige paths, creating insurmountable mid-game advantage.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: I am currently leading 8-6 but have only 2 tokens. The Level 1 card L1_1 (BLACK bonus, 0 points) is effectively free for me to purchase since my bonuses (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3) cover its entire cost of WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. Purchasing this card gives me a crucial BLACK bonus, reducing the effective cost of my reserved L2_68 from BLACK=5 to BLACK=4. This move costs me zero tokens, allowing me to preserve my WHITE=2 tokens for future use while immediately improving my engine. It also denies the opponent access to this BLACK bonus card. This is more efficient than taking tokens or reserving, as I gain a permanent bonus without spending any resources.

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=5}
Reasoning: TURN 22 - IMMEDIATE N5 NOBLE COMPLETION & PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH

CRITICAL STATE:
- My prestige: 6 (OPPONENT AT 8, behind by 2 points)
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (7 total, 3 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE×1, BLUE×1, BLACK×3 (updated from Turn 21 L1_7 purchase)
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=1, BLACK=2, GOLD=5
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0 (critically token-starved)

PREVIOUS TURN SUCCESS:
Turn 21 action (PURCHASE L1_7) was executed successfully:
- Freed 3 token slots (10→7 tokens)
- Acquired BLACK bonus (+1, now BLACK×3 total)
- Positioned me to take tokens this turn without immediate returns

N5 NOBLE COMPLETION ANALYSIS:
N5 requirement: RED×4 + BLACK×4 → +3 prestige
With my BLACK×3 bonus:
- Effective BLACK requirement: 4 - 3 (bonus) = 1 actual BLACK token needed
- I have BLACK=2 ✓ (more than sufficient)
- I need RED=4, currently have RED=3, need RED×1 more
- Board RED available: 1 token (exactly what I need!)

N5 COMPLETION TRIGGER:
If I take RED×1 this turn, I will have:
- RED tokens = 3 + 1 = 4 ✓ (meets requirement)
- BLACK tokens = 2 (with BLACK×3 bonus, this satisfies BLACK×4 requirement) ✓
- Result: Automatically claim N5 noble → +3 prestige → 6+3=9 prestige
- Prestige lead: 9 vs opponent's 8 (advantage established!)

OPTIMAL TOKEN MOVE - TAKE 3 DIFFERENT COLORS (RED×1, BLUE×1, GREEN×1):
Legal requirement: EXACTLY 3 tokens of 3 DIFFERENT colors ✓
- Take RED×1 (CRITICAL for N5, only 1 available on board)
- Take BLUE×1 (abundant, 3 available)
- Take GREEN×1 (abundant, 3 available)

Post-move token state:
- Before: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=3, BLACK=2 (7 total)
- Taking: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=0 (3 tokens)
- After: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=2 (10 total)
- Final = 7 + 3 = 10 tokens ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

POST-ACTION OUTCOME:
- Tokens: RED=4 (N5 RED requirement satisfied ✓)
- Bonuses: BLACK×3 (makes effective BLACK need = 1, I have BLACK=2 ✓)
- Automatically visit N5 noble → +3 prestige
- Prestige advancement: 6 → 9 (BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED)
- Opponent remains capped at 8 prestige (token-starved, no prestige pathways available)
- Prestige advantage: 9 vs 8 = 1-point lead, near-decisive mid-game position

OPPONENT THREAT VERIFICATION:
Opponent has WHITE=2 tokens only (severely constrained):
- L2_46, L2_70: Need BLACK/RED, opponent has 0
- L2_42: Needs WHITE×3+GREEN×3+BLACK×2, opponent has whitespace
- All nobles: Opponent lacks GREEN/RED/BLACK accumulation capability
- Opponent BLOCKED indefinitely from prestige advancement

VICTORY TRAJECTORY POST-MOVE:
- Turn 22 (NOW): Take RED×1, BLUE×1, GREEN×1 → claim N5 → prestige 9
- Turn 23+: With 2-point prestige lead and opponent capped, pursue L3 cards or secondary nobles
- Target prestige 12-15 within 5 turns to secure victory

CONCLUSION:
Execute immediate N5 breakthrough by taking RED×1, BLUE×1, GREEN×1. This single action completes the 2-turn accumulation sequence (L1_7 purchase freed slots, token-taking achieves RED=4), triggers N5 noble claim for +3 prestige, and establishes decisive 1-point prestige lead (9 vs 8) with opponent utterly blocked from advancement. Prestige race shifts from recovery to victory execution.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: I lead 8-6 but only have 2 tokens (WHITE=2). Opponent has 6 points and 10 tokens, with a clear path to purchase L2_55 (2 points, cost RED=4,BLACK=2) using their RED=4 and BLACK=2 tokens, which would tie the score at 8-8. I cannot purchase any point-scoring cards this turn. My best move is to take tokens that set up an immediate score next turn while building toward nobles. Taking BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 gives me the exact resources needed to purchase L2_42 (1 point, BLACK bonus) next turn, whose effective cost is WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 given my bonuses. This move will give me a 9-8 lead after opponent's likely tie. Taking BLUE also progresses me toward noble N4 (needs BLUE=4), and taking GREEN helps with noble N4 (needs GREEN=4). I have no RED tokens and board has RED=0, so I cannot work toward noble N5 which needs RED=4. Taking WHITE would be suboptimal since I already have sufficient WHITE for L2_42. No token return is needed as I'll have 5 total tokens after taking 3.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=5}
Reasoning: TURN 23 - CRITICAL PRESTIGE EQUALIZATION & STRATEGIC CONSOLIDATION

CURRENT CRITICAL STATE:
- My prestige: 6 (OPPONENT AT 8, behind by 2 points - LOSING POSITION)
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=4, BLACK=2 (10 total, maxed)
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=3
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=1 (5 total, 5 free slots)
- Opponent bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1
- Board severely depleted: RED=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1

CRITICAL REASSESSMENT - NOBLE CLAIM FAILURE:
Previous reasoning (Turn 22) falsely assumed I could claim N5 noble with RED=4 tokens. ERROR: Noble requirements are based on BONUSES acquired from purchased cards, NOT tokens!
- N5 requires: RED bonuses ≥4 + BLACK bonuses ≥4
- I have: RED=0 bonuses, BLACK=3 bonuses
- Result: N5 is BLOCKED (need 4 RED bonuses, don't have any)
- Therefore, despite RED=4 tokens, I cannot visit N5 this turn

AFFORDABLE PRESTIGE CARD ANALYSIS:
With bonuses (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=3) reducing card costs:

**L2_55 (2 prestige, WHITE bonus):** Cost GREEN×1 + RED×4 + BLACK×2
- Effective cost after bonuses: GREEN×1 + RED×4 + BLACK×0 (BLACK cost 2 - BLACK bonus 3 = 0)
- I have: GREEN=2 ✓, RED=4 ✓
- AFFORDABLE ✓ AND GAINS 2 PRESTIGE ✓

**L2_70 (3 prestige):** Cost RED×6
- I have RED=4, need 2 more. NOT AFFORDABLE.

**L2_46 (3 prestige):** Cost BLACK×6, effective BLACK×3 (with BLACK×3 bonus)
- I have BLACK=2, short 1. NOT AFFORDABLE.

**L1_36 (0 prestige):** Cost WHITE×1 + RED×1 + BLACK×3, effective WHITE×1
- I have WHITE=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.

**All other prestige cards:** Blocked.

CONCLUSION: L2_55 is the ONLY prestige card currently purchasable.

STRATEGIC RATIONALE FOR L2_55 NOW:
1. **PRESTIGE EQUALIZATION CRITICAL**: Opponent leads 8 vs 6. Gaining +2 prestige ties the race at 8-8 and restores competitiveness. Delaying prestige acquisition while opponent consolidates is losing strategy.
2. **TOKEN LIBERATION**: Spending RED×4 + GREEN×1 = 5 tokens frees capacity from 10→5 total, enabling next turn's token accumulation without forced returns.
3. **BONUS PROGRESSION**: WHITE bonus acquisition (1→2) advances N6 noble path. N6 requires BLUE≥3 + WHITE≥3 + BLACK≥3. After this purchase: WHITE=2/3 ✓ majority, BLACK=3/3 COMPLETE, BLUE=1/3 (need 2 more).
4. **OPPONENT BLOCKED**: Opponent cannot purchase another prestige card (RED=0 on board, making RED×6 for L2_70 unobtainable; opponent has BLACK=1, needs 3+ to afford L2_46). Opponent must accumulate tokens multiple turns while I establish prestige lead.
5. **BOARD DEPLETION REALITY**: With RED=0 on board and RED tokens scarce, RED×4 in hand must be spent productively NOW rather than banked. Opponent will steal RED accumulation if available.
6. **MID-GAME INFLECTION**: At Turn 23, prestige parity is survival. Opponent has 5 free token slots and will accelerate next turn. This move cements prestige tie while I retain initiative.

POST-PURCHASE STATE:
- Prestige: 6 + 2 = 8 (TIED with opponent) ✓
- Tokens: 10 - 5 = 5 total (7 free slots for next turn accumulation) ✓
- Bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3
- Path to N6: 2 more BLUE bonuses needed (1 bonus = 1 card with BLUE bonus)
- Path to next prestige: Reserve/collect L3 cards (4 prestige each) or complete N6 (3 prestige)

OPPONENT THREAT ISOLATION:
Opponent will likely take 3 tokens next turn but faces prestige bottleneck:
- L2_70: Need RED×6 (board RED=0, opponent RED=0) → IMPOSSIBLE
- L2_46: Need BLACK×3 after bonus (opponent BLACK=1) → Need 2+ turns of BLACK accumulation
- Both paths blocked 2+ turns, while I am NOW at prestige parity and free to accumulate tokens or pursue nobles

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 10 tokens
- Purchasing: L2_55 costs GREEN×1 + RED×4 (not requiring RETURN) ✓
- After: 5 tokens remaining ✓

VICTORY PROJECTION:
- Turn 23 (NOW): Purchase L2_55 → prestige 8, WHITE=2 bonus, prestige gap CLOSED
- Turn 24: Take 3 tokens (targeting BLUE accumulation for N6 path)
- Turn 25-26: Continue BLUE bonus acquisition via card purchases
- Turn 27+: CLAIM N6 NOBLE → +3 prestige → 11 total
- Turn 28-30: Target L3 cards (4 prestige each) → 15+ prestige VICTORY

CONCLUSION:
PURCHASE L2_55 to immediately equalize prestige (8-8), liberate token capacity, and acquire WHITE bonus. This single action converts losing position (6 vs 8) into competitive parity while opponent remains blocked from prestige advancement for 2+ turns. Prestige race shifts from deficit to lead-building trajectory.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can immediately purchase L2_42 (1 prestige point, BLACK bonus) from the board. With my bonuses (WHITE=1, GREEN=2, BLACK=1), the effective cost is reduced from WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2 to WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=1, which matches my current tokens exactly. Purchasing this card scores 1 point, taking me from 8 to 9 points and giving me the lead over my opponent. It also increases my BLACK bonus to 2, bringing me closer to noble N5 (RED=4,BLACK=4) and N6 (BLUE=3,WHITE=3,BLACK=3). The opponent also has 8 points, so scoring now is critical to maintain tempo and secure victory. No tokens need to be taken or returned for this purchase action.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: CRITICAL TURN 24 - DOWN 1 PRESTIGE, REASSESSING ENTIRE STRATEGY

CURRENT STATE:
- My prestige: 8 (Opponent: 9 - I'm BEHIND by 1 point, LOSING POSITION)
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=2 (5 total, 5 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3
- Board: WHITE=4, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=4, BLACK=2, GOLD=5
- Opponent severely constrained: BLUE=1 token only

CRITICAL ERROR IN REASONING: TURN 22-23 ANALYSIS FAILURE

My previous reasoning (Turns 22-23) made two fatal errors:
1. Turn 22: Assumed nobles are claimed with TOKENS, not BONUSES. N5 requires RED≥4 BONUSES + BLACK≥4 BONUSES. I have RED=0 bonuses despite having RED=4 tokens. N5 BLOCKED.
2. Turn 23: Executed L2_55 purchase successfully (prestige 8), but opponent still at 9 (not blocked as assumed).

CORRECT NOBLE ASSESSMENT:
- N5 (RED bonuses≥4 + BLACK≥4): I have RED=0 bonuses, BLACK=3 bonuses. BLOCKED indefinitely.
- N6 (BLUE≥3 + WHITE≥3 + BLACK≥3): I have BLUE=1, WHITE=2, BLACK=3. Need BLUE≥2 more (2 cards with BLUE bonus).
- N4 (GREEN≥4 + BLUE≥4): I have GREEN=0, BLUE=1. BLOCKED.

Result: NO NOBLES CLAIMABLE THIS OR NEXT TURN.

AFFORDABLE PRESTIGE CARDS THIS TURN:
Analyzed all face-up prestige cards:
- L1_40 (RED×4→1 prestige): I have RED=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_70 (RED×6→3 prestige): I have RED=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_46 (BLACK×6→3 prestige): Effective BLACK×2 (after BLACK×3 bonus). I have BLACK=2. Could EXACTLY afford... but wait, only if I take tokens and sacrifice this turn to purchase. Then this turn's action is PURCHASE, not TAKE. CHECK FEASIBILITY:
  - If I TAKE_TOKENS this turn: cannot also PURCHASE this turn.
  - If I PURCHASE_CARD this turn: I don't have enough tokens (need BLACK≥2... I have BLACK=2, so L2_46 IS AFFORDABLE RIGHT NOW!)

WAIT - CRITICAL RECHECK: Can I purchase L2_46 RIGHT NOW?
- L2_46 costs BLACK×6
- My BLACK bonus is 3, so effective cost is BLACK×6-3=BLACK×3
- I have BLACK tokens = 2
- I need 3 BLACK tokens, have only 2. NOT AFFORDABLE.

Continuing prestige card assessment:
- L2_56 (RED×5+BLACK×3→2 prestige): I have RED=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_43 (BLUE×1+GREEN×4+RED×2→2 prestige): I have BLUE=2✓ but GREEN=1 (need 4), RED=0 (need 2). NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L3 cards (7+ gems each): Impossible. BLOCKED.
- Reserved L3_78, L2_49, L2_61: All require WHITE≥3, I have WHITE=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.

CONCLUSION: NO PRESTIGE PURCHASE AVAILABLE THIS TURN.

0-PRESTIGE CARD ANALYSIS:
L1_1 (BLACK bonus, costs WHITE×1+BLUE×1+GREEN×1+RED×1): OPPONENT ALREADY PURCHASED - UNAVAILABLE.
L1_23 (BLUE×3 for BLUE bonus): I have BLUE=2, need BLUE≥1 more. NOT AFFORDABLE THIS TURN.
L1_20, L1_36: Both require WHITE≥1 or multiple colors I lack. NOT VIABLE.

RESULT: I CANNOT GAIN PRESTIGE THIS TURN by any mechanism.

OPPONENT THREAT ISOLATION:
Opponent at 9 prestige with only BLUE=1 token (severely token-locked):
- L2_70 (RED×6 for 3 prestige): Opponent RED=0, RED bonus=3 (effective RED×3 cost). If opponent takes RED×2, opponent would have RED=2 vs cost RED×3. BLOCKED for 2+ turns.
- L2_46 (BLACK×6): Opponent BLACK=0, BLACK bonus=2 (effective BLACK×4 cost). BLOCKED for 2+ turns.
- All L3 cards: Require 7 gems, opponent token-constrained. BLOCKED.
- Nobles: Opponent lacks GREEN/BLUE accumulation. BLOCKED.

Opponent is TOTAL PRESTIGE LOCK for next 2-3 turns minimum. I have time to catch up if I position optimally.

OPTIMAL TOKEN ACCUMULATION - FLEXIBILITY FIRST:

Taking WHITE×1 + RED×1 + GREEN×1:
1. **Reopens L1_23 pathway**: After this take, if my future move is to take BLUE×1, I'd have BLUE=3 → purchase L1_23 → gain BLUE bonus (1→2).
2. **Maintains RED accumulation**: Hold RED=1 for eventual L1_40 (RED×4→1 prestige) or L2_70 (RED×6→3 prestige) pathways.
3. **Prevents opponent resource theft**: Opponent will take tokens next turn; I claim GREEN from limited available board GREEN=3.
4. **Post-token state**: 8 total tokens (2 free slots) allows next turn flexibility without forced returns.

ALTERNATIVE REJECTION:
- Taking RED×2 (same color): Only reaches RED=2, not sufficient for any major card.
- Taking BLUE+other colors: Already accounting for this in L1_23 pathway.
- Reserving card: Gets GOLD token but doesn't advance prestige or resource position.

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 5 tokens
- Taking: WHITE=1, RED=1, GREEN=1 (3 different colors) ✓
- After: 5+3=8 total ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

POST-ACTION TRAJECTORY:
- Turn 24 (NOW): Take WHITE, RED, GREEN → 8 tokens, prestige still 8
- Turn 25 (opponent): Opponent likely takes tokens (limited prestige options)
- Turn 26 (me): Option A: Take BLUE → Purchase L1_23 → BLUE bonus 2, OR Option B: Accumulate toward L2_46 (need 1 BLACK more, can take next turn)
- Turn 27-28: Complete L2_46 (BLACK×6, effective BLACK×2) → Prestige 11 (assuming 2 turns away via L1_23 bonus or alternative route)
- Result: Can reach prestige 10-11 by Turn 28-29, exceed opponent's stalled position at 9

CONCLUSION:
Take WHITE×1, RED×1, GREEN×1 to maintain optionality and resource diversity. Opponent blocked from prestige for +2 turns. This accumulation sets up prestige breakthrough within 3-4 turns while defending against prestige gap expansion.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I'm leading 9-8 but have only 1 token (BLUE=1). I cannot purchase any cards this turn. Taking WHITE, RED, and GREEN gives me maximum flexibility toward multiple scoring paths. This helps me progress toward: (1) L2_43 (2 points) needing effective RED=2, GREEN=2, BLUE=1 - I'll be halfway there; (2) L2_70 (3 points) needing effective RED=3 - I'll have 1 of 3; (3) L2_68 (2 points, reserved) needing WHITE=2, BLACK=3 - I'll have 1 WHITE; and (4) nobles N4 (GREEN) and N5 (RED). The opponent has 8 points and 8 tokens, so I must build resources efficiently while maintaining tempo. No token return is needed as I'll have only 4 total tokens after taking these 3.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: TURN 25 - CRITICAL PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH SETUP

CURRENT STATE:
- My prestige: 8 (Opponent: 9 - behind by 1 point, LOSING)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=2 (6 total, 4 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3
- Board depleted: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2, GOLD=5

CRITICAL PRESTIGE CARD ANALYSIS:

L2_46 (3 prestige, BLACK bonus) - BREAKTHROUGH IDENTIFIED:
- Cost: BLACK×6
- My BLACK bonus: 3
- Effective cost: BLACK×6 - 3 = BLACK×3 needed
- I have: BLACK=2
- Missing: BLACK×1 only!
- Board has BLACK=2, exactly what I need

If I take BLACK×1 this turn:
- My tokens become: BLACK=3
- Next turn (Turn 26): Purchase L2_46 immediately for +3 prestige
- My prestige becomes: 8 + 3 = **11**
- Opponent remains at 9
- Gap inverts: **+2 prestige lead established!**

OTHER PRESTIGE CARDS - ALL BLOCKED:
- L1_40 (WHITE×4, effective 2): I have WHITE=1, need +1 more (not this turn)
- L2_70 (RED×6, effective 6): I have RED=1, need +5 more (far away)
- L2_43 (BLUE+GREEN×4+RED×2): Short GREEN×2 (slow accumulation)
- L1_36 (0 prestige, RED bonus): Affordable but doesn't advance prestige count
- All L3 cards: Too expensive

OPTIMAL TOKEN MOVE - WHITE×1 + BLACK×1 + RED×1:

1. **BLACK×1** - CRITICAL: Gets me to exact BLACK=3 needed for L2_46 next turn
2. **WHITE×1** - Advancement: Positions for L1_40 future path (2/2 effective with WHITE bonus 2)
3. **RED×1** - Flexibility: General resource accumulation, prevents opponent token theft

Post-move state:
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (9 total, 1 free slot)
- At token capacity ready for maximum resource efficiency
- Can execute L2_46 purchase immediately next turn

VICTORY SEQUENCE CONFIRMED:
- Turn 25 (NOW): Take WHITE, BLACK, RED
- Turn 26: Purchase L2_46 → Prestige 8 → 11 (LEADERSHIP ESTABLISHED)
- Opponent remains at prestige 9 with only 4 tokens, token-starved
- Opponent's L2_70 path requires RED×6 effective (RED×3 with bonus 3), has RED=1, blocked 2+ turns
- I achieve +2 prestige lead while opponent cannot match accumulation pace

OPPONENT THREAT ISOLATION:
- Opponent has BLUE=1 token only, severely resource-constrained
- Opponent must take tokens next turn but board depleted (max 1-2 per color)
- While opponent rebuilds, I execute prestige breakthrough
- By Turn 27, I'll have prestige 11 vs opponent 9, near-unbeatable position

TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
- Current: 6 tokens
- Taking: WHITE=1, BLACK=1, RED=1 (3 different colors ✓)
- Board supply: WHITE=2 ✓, BLACK=2 ✓, RED=2 ✓
- After: 6 + 3 = 9 tokens ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No returns required ✓

CONCLUSION:
Execute token accumulation (WHITE, BLACK, RED) to lock in L2_46 purchase next turn. This single-turn setup followed by immediate prestige card triggers a +3 prestige swing (8→11), converting losing position (8 vs 9) into decisive leadership (11 vs 9). Opponent completely blocked from prestige advancement for 2+ turns, creating insurmountable mid-game advantage.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: CRITICAL ERROR ANALYSIS & TURN 25 STRATEGIC PIVOT

PREVIOUS ILLEGAL MOVE ERROR:
My previous action attempted to take 3 tokens (WHITE+RED+GREEN) without returning any, resulting in 8+3=11 total tokens (EXCEEDS 10 LIMIT). This was invalid. Correction required.

CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:
- My prestige: 8 (Opponent: 9, behind by 1 point)
- My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=2 (8 total, 2 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3
- Board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2
- Opponent severely token-constrained: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=0 (5 total)

TURN 25 PRESTIGE PATH ANALYSIS:

AFFORDABLE PRESTIGE CARDS THIS TURN:
After comprehensive analysis of all face-up prestige cards:
- L1_40 (WHITE×4→1 prestige): I have WHITE=1, need WHITE=3 more. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_70 (RED×6→3 prestige): I have RED=1, effective cost RED=3 (with RED=0 bonus). Need RED=2 more. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_46 (BLACK×6→3 prestige): I have BLACK=2, effective cost BLACK=3 (with BLACK=3 bonus). Need BLACK=1 more. ALMOST AFFORDABLE.
- L2_56, L2_43: All require tokens I don't have. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- 0-prestige cards (L1_23, L1_20, L1_36): None immediately affordable.

CRITICAL INSIGHT - L2_46 BREAKTHROUGH:
L2_46 (BLACK×6, effective BLACK×3 after BLACK×3 bonus) is the ONLY prestige card within 1 token of affordability:
- Current BLACK: 2 (need 1 more)
- Board BLACK available: 2 (can take 1)
- Next turn: With BLACK=3, I can purchase L2_46 for +3 prestige → prestige 8→11
- Result: +3 prestige lead over opponent (11 vs 9)

OPTIMAL TOKEN MOVE - ACQUIRE FINAL BLACK TOKEN:
To take 1 BLACK and stay within 10-token limit:
- Current: 8 tokens, 2 free slots
- VALID move: Take 3 different colors (3 tokens) and return 1 token
- Taking: BLACK×1 (from board), WHITE×1 (from board), RED×1 (from board)
- Returning: BLUE×1 (I have 2, excess of need)
- Compliance:
  - Board has sufficient tokens: WHITE=2✓, RED=2✓, BLACK=2✓
  - I have BLUE=2 to return✓
  - Rule compliance: 3 different colors legal ✓
  - Final tokens: 8 + 3 - 1 = 10 ✓

POST-ACTION STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (10 total)
- Prestige: 8 (unchanged this turn)
- Black requirement for L2_46: SATISFIED ✓

TURN 26 VICTORY SETUP:
- Purchase L2_46 (BLACK×6, effective BLACK×3) → +3 prestige
- Prestige advancement: 8 → 11
- Lead over opponent: 11 vs 9 (near-decisive 2-point advantage)
- Opponent remains token-starved with no viable prestige advancement paths

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Opponent (prestige 9) has severely limited token resources and no immediate prestige card purchases:
- L2_70 (RED×6, eff. RED×3): Opponent RED=1, needs 2 more (board RED=1 after my take). Would require RED×1 move next turn, leaving opponent unable to purchase this turn.
- L2_46: Opponent BLACK=0, needs 4 after effective cost. Blocked for 2+ turns.
- All L3 cards: Impossible given token constraints.
- Opponent is PRESTIGE LOCKED for 2+ turns while I advance.

CONCLUSION:
Take BLACK×1, WHITE×1, RED×1 (3 different colors), return BLUE×1 to acquire the final BLACK token needed for L2_46 purchase. This single action enables turn 26 prestige breakthrough (8→11), establishing a 2-point lead while opponent remains locked in token accumulation. This move guarantees prestige advantage heading into mid-game endgame.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1}]

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am at 9 points, opponent at 8 points but with 10 tokens and poised to score. I cannot purchase any cards this turn. My fastest path to victory is through L2_43 (2 points, board) which requires only 1 more GREEN token to purchase (effective cost GREEN=2 with my GREEN=2 bonus). Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK now sets up this purchase next turn while providing optimal flexibility: (1) I'll immediately buy L2_43 for 2 points, (2) The BLACK bonus from L2_43 will increase my BLACK bonus to 3, allowing me to claim noble N5 (3 points) using my RED token and BLACK token, reaching 14 points total, (3) It denies opponent WHITE and BLACK tokens they need for their nobles, and (4) The WHITE tokens position me to buy L1_40 (1 point) soon after for the win. This move maintains tempo while building toward a 2-turn victory path that opponent cannot easily disrupt.

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=6}
Reasoning: TURN 26 CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Board tokens severely depleted (BLUE=2, RED=1 only; all other colors=0). Legal token-taking requires either (a) exactly 3 different colors or (b) 2+ tokens of same color if 4+ available. Neither condition can be met. I MUST reserve or purchase. PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY: All face-up prestige cards require resources I lack: L2_46 (short BLACK×1), L2_70 (short RED×5), L2_56 (short RED×4), L1_40 (short WHITE×3), L2_43 (short GREEN×2+RED×1). No cards are immediately purchasable. OPTIMAL ACTION - RESERVE L2_70: (1) Gain +1 GOLD token (critical for future moves). (2) Remove L2_70 (3-prestige card) from opponent's potential paths, denying opponent alternative prestige acceleration. (3) Enable Turn 28 strategy: Use GOLD+BLUE×2 to purchase L1_23 (cost BLUE×3), gaining WHITE bonus #3. (4) Post-L1_23: WHITE=3/3 ✓, BLACK=3/3 ✓, BLUE=1 (need 2 more for N6). This positions me to claim N6 noble (+3 prestige) once BLUE bonuses accumulate. TURN 28+ TRAJECTORY: Purchase L1_23 → prestige 8 (unchanged this turn), WHITE bonus 3 → position for BLUE accumulation or alternative prestige paths. Opponent similarly resource-constrained (BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1 tokens; no immediate prestige purchases). Prestige gap (8 vs 9) closure enabled via this multi-turn sequence.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_70, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot reserve more than 3 cards.
Reasoning: TURN 26 - CRITICAL PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH VIA L2_46 PURCHASE

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
- My prestige: 8 (OPPONENT AT 9, behind by 1 point)
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=3 (10 total, MAXED at capacity)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3
- Board tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=0, GOLD=5
- Opponent prestige: 9 with severely limited tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, total 7)

ERROR CORRECTION:
Previous Turn 25 error (reservation limit) has been resolved. Current state confirms I have exactly 3 reserved cards (L3_78, L2_49, L2_61) which is the legal maximum.

L2_46 PURCHASE AFFORDABILITY - EXACT MATCH:
L2_46 card details:
- Cost: BLACK×6
- Bonus: +1 BLACK bonus (current BLACK×3 → 4)
- Prestige gain: +3
- My effective cost after BLACK×3 bonus: BLACK×6 - BLACK×3 = BLACK×3 required
- I have: BLACK=3 tokens ✓ EXACTLY AFFORDABLE
- Card is face-up on board: YES ✓

VICTORY TRIGGER - IMMEDIATE:
Purchasing L2_46 NOW:
- Before: Prestige 8, BLACK tokens=3
- After: Prestige 8 + 3 = PRESTIGE 11, BLACK tokens consumed (0 after purchase)
- Result: 11 prestige vs opponent 9 prestige = 2-POINT LEAD ESTABLISHED
- Remaining tokens after purchase: 10 - 3 = 7 tokens (3 free slots next turn)

WHY THIS IS OPTIMAL:
1. **PRESTIGE LEAD SECURED**: This single purchase converts losing position (8 vs 9) into commanding lead (11 vs 9). Opponent remains at 9 with no viable prestige pathways:
   - L2_70 (RED×6, eff. RED×3): Opponent RED=1, needs 2 more. Board RED=1. Blocked.
   - L2_46 itself consumed by me, unavailable to opponent.
   - L3 cards (7+ gems): Opponent token-starved, impossible.
   - Nobles: All blocked (N5 needs RED bonuses, opponent has RED=0; N6 needs BLUE≥3, opponent has BLUE=1; N4 needs GREEN≥4, opponent has GREEN=0).

2. **NO BETTER ALTERNATIVE EXISTS**: All other face-up cards are either inferior (fewer prestige points) or completely unaffordable:
   - L2_70 (RED×6): I have RED=2, need 4 more. NOT AFFORDABLE.
   - L2_56, L2_43: All require resources I lack. NOT AFFORDABLE.
   - L1 cards: 0-1 prestige max, comparatively useless vs 3-prestige card.
   - Reserved cards (L3_78, L2_49, L2_61): All require WHITE≥4, I have WHITE=2. NOT AFFORDABLE.

3. **TOKEN CAPACITY MANAGEMENT**: After purchase, I drop to 7 tokens with 3 free slots, allowing next turn flexibility for token accumulation without forced returns. This positions me optimally for Turn 27 and beyond.

4. **BOARD STATE VERIFICATION**:
   - L2_46 confirmed face-up in LEVEL_2 cards ✓
   - Cost verified: BLACK×6 ✓
   - My bonus coverage verified: BLACK×3 bonus reduces effective cost to BLACK×3 ✓
   - I have BLACK×3 to spend ✓

POST-PURCHASE PROJECTED STATE:
- My prestige: 11 (COMMANDING LEAD)
- My tokens: 7/10 (flexible next turn)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=4 (4th BLACK bonus acquired)
- Opponent prestige: 9 (STALLED, no prestige paths available)
- Opponent tokens: 7/10 with no productive options

VICTORY PROJECTION:
With 11 prestige vs opponent 9, I need only 4 more points to reach 15 and win. Opponent with limited resources and no prestige advancement paths is effectively locked out. Within the next 3-4 turns, I can accumulate sufficient tokens to purchase either another 3+ prestige card or complete a noble (N6 requires 2 more BLUE bonuses, achievable within window). Victory margin increases every turn opponent remains blocked.

CONCLUSION:
Execute L2_46 purchase immediately. This action establishes a decisive 2-point prestige lead (11 vs 9), consumes exactly my available BLACK tokens, and leaves opponent with zero viable prestige advancement pathways. Prestige race shifts from competitive (8 vs 9) to overwhelming victory trajectory (11 vs 9 → 15+ within 4 turns).

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 11 points, opponent has 9 points. I have 7 tokens (WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1) and need to reach 15 points efficiently. Immediate purchase opportunities: None - I cannot afford any cards currently. Looking at scoring paths: 1) My reserved L2_68 (2 points) needs WHITE=3, BLACK=5. With bonuses, effective cost is WHITE=2, BLACK=5. I currently have WHITE=2, BLACK=1, so need 4 more BLACK tokens (or equivalent in gold). 2) L2_43 on board (2 points) needs BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. With bonuses (BLUE=1, GREEN=2), effective cost is GREEN=2, RED=2. I have GREEN=2, RED=1, so need 1 more RED token. 3) L1_40 (1 point) on board needs WHITE=4 - with bonuses, effective cost WHITE=3. I have WHITE=2, so need 1 more WHITE token. 4) Opponent has 9 points and could be close to scoring, so I need to secure points quickly. The fastest path is to acquire 4 more BLACK tokens for L2_68 (2 points), which would take 13+14+14 = 41 tokens if taking 2-of-same, or 4 turns taking 3 tokens each. However, I notice board supply: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=3, GOLD=5. I cannot take WHITE (0 available) or GREEN (0 available). I can only take BLUE, RED, or BLACK. Taking 2 BLACK tokens is possible (BLACK board count is 3, which is <4, so I CANNOT take 2-of-same black). So I must take 3 different tokens, but only BLUE, RED, and BLACK are available. Taking BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 gives me: - BLUE would become 2 total (but I already have BLUE=1 bonus + 1 token = 2 effective, and my reserved L3_78 needs BLUE=3, so this helps there) - RED would become 2 total, which is exactly what I need to purchase L2_43 next turn for 2 points - BLACK would become 2 total, progressing toward the 4 needed for L2_68 However, taking tokens doesn't score points immediately and my opponent could score to 11 or 12. Let me reconsider: Wait, I should check if I can purchase something with current tokens plus taking tokens. After taking BLUE, RED, BLACK: my tokens would be WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 (total 10 tokens). New effective totals: BLUE=3 (1 bonus + 2 tokens), RED=5 (3 bonuses + 2 tokens), BLACK=6 (4 bonuses + 2 tokens). Can I purchase anything then? L2_43 needs effective GREEN=2, RED=2. I would have GREEN=2 (2 bonus + 0 tokens, wait I have GREEN=2 tokens but no bonus), let me recalculate: My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2 (from previous state). Current tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1. If I take BLUE, RED, BLACK: New tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2. Effective totals: WHITE=2+1=3, BLUE=2+1=3, GREEN=2+2=4, RED=2+3=5, BLACK=2+2=4. Now checking purchases: - L2_43: needs GREEN=4-2=2, RED=2-3=-1 (already covered). I have GREEN=4 effective, so I can purchase L2_43 immediately! Wait, let me verify the actual card: L2_43 cost is BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. With my bonuses (BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3), effective cost is: BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=0. So I only need GREEN=2 in tokens. I currently have GREEN=2 tokens, so I can purchase L2_43 **right now** without taking any tokens! Let me recalculate my current effective totals: Bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2 Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 Effective: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=4, RED=4, BLACK=3 L2_43 cost: BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. With bonuses: - need BLUE=1-1=0 - need GREEN=4-2=2 - need RED=2-3=0 (already covered) I have GREEN=2 tokens, so I can purchase L2_42 right now! This is critical - I miscounted earlier. This gives me 2 points, taking me from 11 to 13 points. This also gives me a BLACK bonus, increasing my BLACK bonus to 3, helping toward noble N5 (RED=4,BLACK=4). After purchase, my tokens would be: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (GREEN tokens spent). Total 5 tokens. This is clearly the best move - immediate scoring to 13 points while maintaining token efficiency.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I can immediately purchase the 2-point card L2_68 from my reserved cards. With my current bonuses (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2) and tokens (WHITE=2, BLACK=1), the effective cost is reduced from BLACK=5 to BLACK=3. I have exactly BLACK=1 token and will spend it, plus I can use 2 gold tokens from the board (available: GOLD=5) to cover the remaining cost of BLACK=2. However, looking more carefully, the card costs WHITE=3, BLACK=5 total, and I have WHITE=2 bonus + WHITE=2 tokens, so I don't need any gold for WHITE. For BLACK, I have BLACK=2 bonus + BLACK=1 token, so I need 2 more BLACK which I don't have tokens for, so I would need to use 2 gold tokens. Wait, let me recalculate: The L2_68 card costs WHITE=3, BLACK=5. My bonuses are WHITE=1 and BLACK=2. So effective cost is WHITE=2, BLACK=3. I have WHITE=2 tokens and BLACK=1 token. So I would need 2 more BLACK which I don't have - I could use gold tokens to substitute. The board has GOLD=5 available, so I can take 2 GOLD and use them. But wait, I can't take tokens and purchase in the same turn. Let me recalculate again: I need to pay BLACK=3 net cost. I have BLACK=1 token, so I'm short by 2. I would need to spend 2 gold tokens, but I have 0 gold tokens currently. I cannot take gold tokens simultaneously with purchasing. Let me check my available tokens again: I have WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1. So for the net cost of BLACK=3, I have BLACK=1 available in my tokens. I'm short by BLACK=2. I cannot complete this purchase without gold tokens, which I don't have. 

Wait, let me reconsider the rules. When purchasing, you can use gold tokens you already have to substitute any color. But you cannot acquire gold tokens in the same action as purchasing. Since I have 0 gold tokens, I cannot substitute the missing BLACK=2 cost. Therefore, I cannot purchase L2_68 this turn. 

Let me look for alternatives. Looking at the board, I could take tokens to set up future purchases. I currently have 7 tokens total. If I take 3 tokens, I'll be at 10, so no return needed. 

What are my scoring options? I need 6 more points to reach 15. 

Option 1: Take WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1. This would give me: WHITE=3, GREEN=3, BLACK=2. Looking at L2_43 (2 points, GREEN=4, RED=2 cost) - with my GREEN=2 bonus, I would need effective GREEN=2. I'd have GREEN=3 tokens, so I could buy it next turn if I get the right tokens.

Option 2: Working toward noble N5 (RED=4,BLACK=4). I have RED=3, BLACK=2 in bonuses. I need effective RED=1, BLACK=2. I currently have RED=1 token, BLACK=1 token. If I take BLACK=1 more, I could potentially get noble N5 soon.

Option 3: Purchase a lower point card to reach 10 or 11 points. Let me check what's affordable:
- L1_40 costs WHITE=4, gives 1 point. I have WHITE=2 tokens only, so can't afford.
- L2_43 costs BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. With my GREEN=2 bonus, I need effective GREEN=2, RED=2. I have GREEN=2, RED=1 tokens. I need 1 more RED and can't pay for BLUE, so can't purchase.

Given my current state (9 points, opponent at 11), I'm behind and need to score quickly. Let me reconsider L2_43. The cost is BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. With my bonuses (BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3), the effective cost is GREEN=2, RED=-1 (meaning I don't need RED). So I just need to pay GREEN=2 and the BLUE cost is covered by my bonus. I have GREEN=2 tokens, so I have exactly what I need! The RED requirement is met by my bonus, so I don't need to pay any RED tokens.

Wait, that's wrong. Let me recalculate carefully. My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2. Card L2_43 costs BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2. After applying bonuses: BLUE=1 (cost) - BLUE=1 (bonus) = 0. GREEN=4 (cost) - GREEN=2 (bonus) = 2. RED=2 (cost) - RED=3 (bonus) = MAX(0, -1) = 0. So net cost is GREEN=2. I have GREEN=2 tokens. Perfect! I can purchase L2_43 this turn and gain 2 points, taking me from 9 to 11 points.

This would tie me with my opponent and give me more bonuses (BLACK would become 3). This seems like the best move.

Actually wait, let me double-check my token count. I have: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=0. That's 7 tokens total. If I purchase L2_43, I'll spend GREEN=2 tokens, leaving me with 5 tokens. That's perfectly fine.

After purchasing L2_43, I'll have:
- Score: 9 + 2 = 11 points
- Bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1

This sets me up nicely for noble N5 (RED=4,BLACK=4) - I would need effective RED=1, BLACK=1, which I have in tokens right now! Actually, with my new bonuses RED=3, BLACK=3, and noble N5 requiring RED=4,BLACK=4, I need effective RED=1, BLACK=1. I have RED=1 token and BLACK=1 token, so I could immediately claim noble N5 on my next turn if no one else takes it first. That would give me 3 more points, taking me to 14 points.

Actually, can I claim a noble immediately after purchasing a card? I believe nobles are claimed at the end of a turn if you meet the requirements. But I think you need to wait until the start of your next turn. Let me check the typical Splendor rules - usually you claim nobles immediately when you meet the requirements, even during the same turn after purchasing a card. If that's the case, I could potentially claim N5 this turn after purchasing L2_43, which would give me 11 + 3 = 14 points immediately! That would put me very close to winning.

Let me verify my bonuses after purchase: Current bonuses are WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2. Adding L2_43 (BLACK bonus) gives me BLACK=3. So new bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3.

For noble N5 (RED=4,BLACK=4), I have RED=3, BLACK=3, so I need effective RED=1, BLACK=1.

For noble N6 (BLUE=3,WHITE=3,BLACK=3), I have BLUE=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=3, so I need effective BLUE=2, WHITE=2.

For noble N4 (GREEN=4,BLUE=4), I have GREEN=2, BLUE=1, so I need effective GREEN=2, BLUE=3.

I currently have tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1.

So if I purchase L2_43, my new state would be:
- Score: 11 points
- Tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1
- Bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3

For noble N5, I still need effective RED=1, BLACK=1. I have RED=1 token and BLACK=1 token, so I do meet the requirements for N5! If nobles are claimed immediately, I would get 3 more points, reaching 14 total.

Actually, I think the rule is that nobles are automatically claimed at the end of your turn if you meet the requirements. So after purchasing L2_43, I would check if I qualify for any nobles. Since I have RED=1 token and BLACK=1 token, and with my bonuses RED=3, BLACK=3, I meet the requirement of RED=4,BLACK=4 for N5. So I would claim N5 and get 3 points, going from 11 to 14 points.

This would put me at 14 points, just 1 away from winning. The opponent is at 11 points, so this would give me a strong lead.

Let me verify this path once more:
1. Purchase L2_43 for net cost GREEN=2 (using my GREEN=2 tokens)
2. Gain 2 prestige points: 9 -> 11 points
3. Gain BLACK bonus: BLACK bonus increases from 2 to 3
4. Check nobles: With bonuses RED=3,BLACK=3 and tokens RED=1,BLACK=1, I meet N5 requirement
5. Claim N5: +3 points, 11 -> 14 points
6. Final state: 14 points, tokens remaining WHITE=2,BLUE=1,RED=1,BLACK=1

This is an excellent move that puts me in a winning position. I should purchase L2_43.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_68]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_68
Reasoning: I am behind 9-11 and need to score quickly. My best path is to purchase my reserved L2_68 (2 points, RED bonus) next turn. With my bonuses (WHITE=1, BLACK=2), its effective cost is WHITE=2, BLACK=3. I currently have WHITE=2, BLACK=1, so I need 2 more BLACK tokens. Taking 2 BLACK tokens now (board has BLACK=3 available) sets up this purchase for next turn. This also progresses me toward noble N5 (needs BLACK=4) and prevents opponent from accessing BLACK tokens they need for L2_56 and their own N5. I will have 9 total tokens after this move (7 current + 2 taken), so no return is needed. While taking 2 same-color tokens is normally suboptimal, the immediate 2-point score next turn justifies it given the score deficit.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 1 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLACK tokens: only 3 available (need 4).. Skipping turn.

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: TURN 27 - STRATEGIC TOKEN ACCUMULATION & COMPETITIVE RE-MANEUVERING

CRITICAL STATE:
- My prestige: 11 (Opponent: 9, leading by 2 points but EXPOSED)
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0 (7 total, 3 free slots)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=4, RED=0
- Board tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=3, GOLD=5
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 (7 total)
- Opponent bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2

CRITICAL THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Opponent at 9 prestige with surprising prestige accessibility:
- L2_43 (BLUE×1+GREEN×4+RED×2→2 prestige): With GREEN×2 bonus, effective cost is BLUE×0 (BLUE bonus covers 1), GREEN×2 (has 2✓), RED×0 (RED bonuses exceed cost). Opponent CAN AFFORD THIS IMMEDIATELY.
- If opponent purchases L2_43 next turn: Prestige 9→11 (TIES ME)
- Prestige race becomes: From tied 11-11, first to 15 wins = ONLY 4 MORE PRESTIGE NEEDED BY EITHER PLAYER.

IMEDIATE PRESTIGE PURCHASE ANALYSIS - BLOCKING OPTIONS:
Can I buy a prestige card THIS TURN to maintain 2-point lead?
- L2_70 (RED×6→3 prestige): I have RED=2, effective cost RED=6 (no RED bonus), need 4 more. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_64 (GREEN×6→3 prestige): Board GREEN=0. IMPOSSIBLE.
- L2_56 (RED×5+BLACK×3→2 prestige): Effective RED×5 (no RED bonus), need 3 more RED. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_43: Already analyzed, not available if I buy it, but opponent can buy.
- L1_40 (WHITE×4→1 prestige): I have WHITE=2, board WHITE=0, need 2 more. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- No prestige card is immediately purchasable.

BONUS-BUILDING ANALYSIS:
- L1_36 (RED bonus, costs WHITE×1+RED×1+BLACK×0 effective): I CAN AFFORD this, but doesn't gain prestige (0-prestige card). If I buy L1_36, opponent still ties at 11 next turn while I'm forced to 11 (no net prestige gain).
- L1_20 (WHITE bonus, costs WHITE×1 effective): Also 0-prestige card, same problem.
- L1_23 (BLUE bonus, costs BLUE×3): I have BLUE=1, need 2 more. Board BLUE=2 available. NOT IMMEDIATELY AFFORDABLE.

STRATEGIC DECISION - TOKEN ACCUMULATION:
Buying a 0-prestige bonus card now would:
1. Sideline my turn for non-prestige gain
2. Allow opponent to buy L2_43 and tie at 11 without my counter-prestige progress
3. Still leave me needing multiple future turns to leverage that bonus

Instead, TAKE TOKENS strategy:
1. Accumulates flexibility and resource diversity
2. Keeps my turn efficient (3 free slots available)
3. Sets up multiple future prestige pathways simultaneously:
   - RED accumulation → L2_70 (3 prestige) pathway if RED bonus acquired later
   - BLACK maintained → preserves BLACK×4 bonus utility
   - BLUE accumulation → keeps L1_23 (BLUE bonus) pathway viable; board has BLUE=2, if I take BLUE=1 now, max future BLUE=1+2=3, exactly matches L1_23 cost
4. Prevents token waste from forced returns

OPTIMAL TOKEN MOVE - THREE DIFFERENT COLORS:
- Take BLUE×1 (board has 2 available)
- Take RED×1 (board has 1 available)
- Take BLACK×1 (board has 3 available)

Post-move token state:
- Before: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0 (7 total)
- Taking: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (3 tokens, 3 different colors) ✓
- After: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (9 total)
- Final = 7 + 3 = 10 tokens? NO WAIT: 7+3=10, but let me recount: WHITE=2+0=2, BLUE=1+1=2, GREEN=2+0=2, RED=2+1=3, BLACK=0+1=1. Total: 2+2+2+3+1=10 tokens max capacity ✓
- No returns required ✓

POST-ACTION TRAJECTORY:
- Turn 27 (NOW): Take BLUE, RED, BLACK → prestige 11, tokens 10/10
- Turn 28 (opponent): Expected opponent buys L2_43 → prestige 11 (tied)
- Turn 29 (me): With accumulated RED=3 + future accumulation, can work toward L2_70. OR with BLUE=2 + potentially 1 more from board, can buy L1_23 for BLUE bonus, then pivot to other cards. Flexibility maintained.
- Future turns: Multiple pathways to prestige 12-15 (L2_70 at 3 prestige, L1_40 at 1 prestige, or other combinations) while opponent token-constrained.

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:
Even if opponent ties at 11 prestige, I maintain superior token position (10 vs 7) and have clearer sight lines to future prestige cards. The 2-point lead converts to flexibility lead, which is valuable in endgame (turns 28-32).

CONCLUSION:
Take BLUE×1, RED×1, BLACK×1 to accumulate diverse resources, maintain token efficiency, and prepare for multi-branched prestige pathways. Accept opponent's tie at 11 prestige next turn (inevitable given board state), but leverage accumulated tokens to pull ahead in prestige race turns 29-31. This action prioritizes optionality over immediate prestige, which is strategically sound given prestige card scarcity.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 27 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I lead 9-8 over opponent (Player 0) who has 11 points. I cannot let them reach 15 points first. I can immediately purchase L2_43 (2 points, BLACK bonus) from board. With my bonuses (WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2), the effective cost is BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2. I have exact tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1. Need 1 more RED token to afford cost. Wait - let me recalculate. 

My current tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=0
My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=2
L2_43 cost: BLUE=1, GREEN=4, RED=2
Effective cost after bonuses: BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=0 (since I have RED=3 bonus > RED=2 cost, GREEN=2 bonus covers part of GREEN=4 cost, leaving GREEN=2 needed)
I have GREEN=2 tokens, so I can afford it! No GOLD needed. 

Purchasing L2_43 scores 2 points, taking me to 11 points. It also increases my BLACK bonus to 3, putting me within 1 BLACK of noble N5 (needs BLACK=4). This is critical tempo - while opponent is at 11, I need to close the gap immediately. I also block opponent from this 2-point card which they could potentially buy next turn. This purchase costs me BLUE=1, GREEN=2 tokens, leaving me with WHITE=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 tokens - still respectable resources for future purchases.

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=5}
Reasoning: TURN 28 - CRITICAL ENDGAME: DECISIVE PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH

CURRENT STATE:
- My prestige: 11 (Opponent ALSO 11 - EXACTLY TIED)
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (10 total, maxed)
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=4, RED=0, GREEN=0
- Board tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=2
- Opponent prestige: 11 (just purchased L2_43 as predicted, now tied)
- Opponent tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=1 (5 total, severely constrained)
- Opponent bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3

CRITICAL ENDGAME SITUATION:
We are in the final stretch - both at 11 prestige, first to 15 wins (need 4 more each). This is likely the pivotal turn that determines the victory.

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Can opponent purchase prestige immediately?
- L2_70 (RED×6→3 prestige): Effective cost RED×3 (opponent RED bonus=3). Opponent has RED=1. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_64 (GREEN×6→3 prestige): Effective cost GREEN×4 (opponent GREEN bonus=2). Opponent has GREEN=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_56 (RED×5+BLACK×3→2 prestige): Effective cost RED×2+BLACK×0 (opponent RED bonus=3, BLACK bonus=3). Opponent has RED=1, BLACK=1. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_60 (WHITE×2+BLUE×3+BLACK×2→1 prestige): Effective cost WHITE×1+BLUE×2+BLACK×0. Opponent has WHITE=2✓ but BLUE=1 (needs 2). NOT AFFORDABLE.
- Reserved L2_68: Effective cost WHITE×2+BLACK×2. Opponent has WHITE=2✓ but BLACK=1 (needs 2). NOT AFFORDABLE.
- All L3 cards: Impossible (7+ gems needed).

CONCLUSION: Opponent is PRESTIGE LOCKED for at least 1+ turns. I have a window to break the tie decisively.

MY PRESTIGE PURCHASE OPTIONS THIS TURN:

**L2_61 (Reserved Card - ANALYSIS):**
- Card cost: WHITE×4 + BLUE×2 + BLACK×1
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=4
- Effective cost: WHITE×2 (4-2) + BLUE×1 (2-1) + BLACK×0 (1-4 = 0, bonus exceeds cost)
- I have: WHITE=2✓, BLUE=2✓, BLACK=1 (only need 0)
- AFFORDABLE ✓ → Gains +2 prestige ✓
- Post-purchase bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, BLACK=4, GREEN=1

**L1_40 (WHITE×4→1 prestige):**
- Cost: WHITE×4
- Effective: WHITE×2 (4-2 bonus)
- I have: WHITE=2✓
- AFFORDABLE ✓ → Gains +1 prestige

**L2_60 (WHITE×2+BLUE×3+BLACK×2→1 prestige):**
- Cost: WHITE×2 + BLUE×3 + BLACK×2
- Effective: WHITE×0 (2-2) + BLUE×2 (3-1) + BLACK×0 (2-4)
- I have: WHITE=2, BLUE=2✓, BLACK=1 (need 0)
- AFFORDABLE ✓ → Gains +1 prestige

ALL OTHER PRESTIGE CARDS: NOT AFFORDABLE (require resources I don't have access to)

OPTIMAL CHOICE - L2_61 (RESERVED):

Why L2_61 is superior:
1. **+2 prestige in single purchase**: Immediately advances from 11→13 (only 2 away from victory at 15)
2. **Decisive lead**: Creates 2-point advantage (13 vs opponent's locked 11)
3. **Opponent cannot counter**: Opponent prestige-locked for 1+ turns, cannot immediately tie or exceed 13
4. **Victory trajectory**: Opponent needs 4 prestige to tie/win (impossible in 1 turn), I need only 2 more (achievable within 1-2 turns via remaining prestige cards or nobles)
5. **Bonus accumulation**: Acquire GREEN bonus (0→1), which diversifies options for future turns
6. **Token efficiency**: Spend exactly WHITE=2+BLUE=1 (use exactly available, no waste)

Comparison:
- L1_40 (+1 prestige): Leaves me at 12, opponent at 11. Only 1-point lead vs 2-point lead from L2_61. INFERIOR.
- L2_60 (+1 prestige): Same as L1_40. INFERIOR.

POST-PURCHASE STATE:
- Prestige: 11 + 2 = 13 (2-point lead, need only 2 more to win at 15)
- Tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=1 (7 total, 3 free slots for flexibility)
- Bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, BLACK=4, GREEN=1, RED=0
- Status: Near-victory position, opponent blocked from immediate prestige advancement

VICTORY PROJECTION:
- This turn (Turn 28): Purchase L2_61 → prestige 13 (lead 13 vs 11)
- Turn 29: Opponent accumulates tokens (forced, no prestige cards affordable)
- Turn 30: I purchase either L2_70 (RED×6 effective RED×6, need 3 more RED tokens via next turn token take) OR complete a noble (if I can acquire necessary bonuses), OR continue token accumulation if no prestige card immediately affordable
- Turn 31-32: Reach prestige 15+ and WIN

CONCLUSION:
Execute L2_61 purchase NOW. This single action establishes a decisive 2-point prestige lead (13 vs 11) in tied endgame, creates an almost-insurmountable advantage (opponent prestige-locked while I'm only 2 points from victory), and locks in a near-certain victory trajectory within 2-3 turns.

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=4}
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Unknown action type: 
Reasoning: I am at 11 points, opponent at 13 points. Opponent needs only 1 RED token to claim noble N5 (3 points) and win at 16 points. RED is currently unavailable on the board (RED=0), giving me a critical turn to prepare. I cannot purchase any cards this turn. My fastest winning path is to acquire enough resources to purchase L3_73 (4 points) next turn, which would take me to exactly 15 points. L3_73 requires effective cost of GREEN=1, RED=3 given my bonuses (GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3). I currently have GREEN=0 and RED=1 tokens, so I need GREEN=1 and RED=2 more. Since I cannot take RED this turn, I must take GREEN now to enable this path. Taking GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK tokens gives me optimal flexibility: (1) It provides the required GREEN=1 token for L3_73, (2) It builds toward L2_68 (2 points, reserved) as a backup plan if RED doesn't appear, (3) It denies opponent BLUE and BLACK tokens they need for their nobles, and (4) It maintains token count at 8 (under the 10 limit). This move positions me to win next turn if RED tokens become available, which is critical since opponent is poised to win on their next RED acquisition.

- L2_56 (RED×5+BLACK×3→2 prestige): Effective RED×5+BLACK×0. I have RED=3. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_64 (GREEN×6→3 prestige): Effective GREEN×5 (1 bonus). I have GREEN=2. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_60 (WHITE×2+BLUE×3+BLACK×2→1 prestige): Effective WHITE×0+BLUE×2+BLACK×0. I have BLUE=1. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L1_40 (WHITE×4→1 prestige): Effective WHITE×2. I have WHITE=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L1_36 (RED×1 effective→0 prestige): AFFORDABLE, but doesn't advance prestige (defensive only).

OPPONENT THREAT NEXT TURN:
Opponent CAN purchase L2_60:
- L2_60 effective cost: WHITE×1+BLUE×2+BLACK×0
- Opponent has: WHITE=2✓, BLUE=2✓, BLACK=2
- If opponent buys L2_60 next turn: Prestige 11→12 (I maintain 1-point lead)

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
Both players now in resource accumulation phase. I cannot generate +2 prestige immediately. My lead (13 vs 11) is defensible but requires maintaining optionality.

NOBLE PATHS (Long-term):
- N6 (BLUE≥3+WHITE≥3+BLACK≥3): I have BLUE=1, WHITE=2, BLACK=4. Need BLUE≥2 more, WHITE≥1 more. Achievable long-term via L1_20 (WHITE bonus) + L1_23 (BLUE bonus), but requires multiple turns.
- N5 (RED≥4+BLACK≥4): I have RED=0. Blocked indefinitely unless I accumulate RED bonuses (slow path via L1_36, L1_40, etc.).
- N4: Blocked (need GREEN≥4+BLUE≥4, have GREEN=1, BLUE=1).

TOKEN STRATEGY - DIVERSIFICATION:
Rather than committing to a single prestige card path (all blocked), I should accumulate diverse tokens to maintain flexibility for:
1. Future prestige card opportunities if RED/GREEN refresh on board
2. Bonus accumulation toward nobles (mid-game)
3. Tactical responses to opponent's moves (if opponent consumes key cards, I pivot)

OPTIMAL TOKEN MOVE:
Take BLUE×1, GREEN×1, BLACK×1 (3 different colors):
- RATIONALE:
  * BLUE accumulation helps toward L1_23 (BLUE bonus) and L3_84 (4 prestige, BLUE×7)
  * GREEN accumulation helps toward L2_64 (3 prestige, GREEN×6) and L3_88 (4 prestige)
  * BLACK maintains utility (used by many cards, already have bonus for it)
  * Board has exactly 1 of each color available
  
- TOKEN COMPLIANCE:
  * Current: 7 tokens (3 free slots)
  * Taking: BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 (3 tokens, 3 different colors) ✓
  * After: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2 (10 total) ✓
  * No returns needed ✓

POST-ACTION STATE:
- Prestige: 13 (unchanged this turn)
- Tokens: 10/10 (maxed, but sets up with critical green and blue for future turns)
- Flexibility: Next turn, I may have freed up tokens or new board state
- Lead maintained: 13 vs opponent's likely 12 (after L2_60 purchase)

VICTORY PROJECTION:
- This accumulation positions me for emergent opportunities:
  * If RED tokens reappear on board in future turns → potential L2_70 path
  * If I buy L1_20 (WHITE×1 affordable) + L1_23 (harder but possible with future tokens), I can approach N6 for +3 prestige
  * If opponent further depletes board resources, I maintain superior token position to pivot

CONCLUSION:
Take BLUE×1, GREEN×1, BLACK×1 to maintain prestige lead while avoiding forced defensive moves (like buying L1_36 for 0 prestige). This action preserves optionality in a resource deadlock, positions me for multiple mid-term prestige pathways, and keeps opponent from easily catching up while I control the tempo of prestige advancement.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 29 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I'm at 11 points, opponent at 13 points and desperately needs RED tokens to win via noble N5 (3 points) since they have 4 BLACK and 3 RED currently. RED is depleted on the board (RED=0), but has 5 GOLD and could reserve a card to get gold. However, I have an immediate winning path: I can purchase my reserved card L2_68 for 2 points, taking me to 13 points total.

Let me calculate the cost:
- L2_68 cost: WHITE=3, BLACK=5
- My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLACK=3
- Effective cost: WHITE=2, BLACK=2
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLACK=2
- I can afford it exactly!

Purchasing L2_68 gives me a RED bonus, bringing my RED bonus to 4. This is crucial because:
1. It scores 2 points, taking me from 11 to 13 points
2. I block my opponent from getting RED tokens while the board has none
3. With RED=4 bonus and BLACK=3 bonus, I'm now 1 RED away from noble N5 (needs RED=4, BLACK=4) - exactly where my opponent is!
4. I'm 2 points away from victory (15 points)

Checking other options:
- L3_73 would give 4 points but I don't have GREEN tokens needed
- L2_70 needs RED which is unavailable
- L3_88 needs GREEN which is unavailable
- L2_56 needs RED
- L3_72 needs RED

This is my best move. The purchase costs me WHITE=2, BLACK=2 tokens, leaving me with WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=0 tokens - still 4 tokens total (under the 10 limit).

Turn 30 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=6}
Reasoning: TURN 30 - CRITICAL PRESTIGE RACE: PURCHASE L2_60 TO BREAK TIE AND REACH 14 PRESTIGE (1 AWAY FROM VICTORY)

CURRENT STATE - EXACTLY TIED AT 13 PRESTIGE:
- My prestige: 13 | Opponent prestige: 13
- First to 15 wins. Both need exactly 2 more prestige points.
- My tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2 (10/10 maxed)
- Board tokens: WHITE=4, BLACK=2 only (BLUE/GREEN/RED depleted)
- Opponent tokens: BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=0 (4/10, plenty of capacity)

PRESTIGE CARDS AFFORDABILITY CHECK:

**L2_60 (WHITE×2+BLUE×3+BLACK×2→1 prestige) - AFFORDABLE ✓**
- Card cost: WHITE×2, BLUE×3, BLACK×2
- My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=4
- Effective cost: WHITE×0 (2-2) + BLUE×2 (3-1) + BLACK×0 (covered by bonus)
- I have: BLUE=2 exact match ✓
- Card is face-up: YES ✓
- RESULT: Prestige 13→14 (ONLY 1 POINT AWAY FROM 15/VICTORY)

**ALL OTHER PRESTIGE CARDS - NOT AFFORDABLE:**
- L1_40 (WHITE×4→1): Effective WHITE×2. I have WHITE=0. BLOCKED.
- L2_56 (RED×5+BLACK×3→2): Effective RED×5. I have RED=3. BLOCKED (need RED×5).
- L2_70 (RED×6→3): Effective RED×6. I have RED=3. BLOCKED (need RED×6).
- L2_64 (GREEN×6→3): Effective GREEN×5. I have GREEN=3. BLOCKED (need GREEN×5).
- L3 cards: All require 7+ gems. IMPOSSIBLE.
- Reserved L3_78: WHITE×7 needed. BLOCKED.
- Reserved L2_49: Effective WHITE×3 needed. I have WHITE=0. BLOCKED.

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT - PRESTIGE LOCKED:
Can opponent purchase prestige this turn?
- L2_56: Effective RED×2 (after RED bonus×4). Opponent has RED=1. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_70: Effective RED×3. Opponent has RED=1. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L2_64: Effective GREEN×4 (after GREEN bonus×2). Opponent has GREEN=1. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- L1_40: Effective WHITE×3 (after WHITE bonus×1). Opponent has WHITE=0. NOT AFFORDABLE.
- All L3 cards: IMPOSSIBLE.

OPPONENT CONCLUSION: Prestige-locked for 1+ turns while I advance.

WHY NOT TAKE TOKENS?
- Current tokens at 10/10 capacity
- Can only take WHITE×2 (board has 4 available)
- Would require returning 2 tokens for 0 net prestige gain
- Wastes turn in a prestige race toward 15
- No strategic value when prestige purchase is available

WHY NOT RESERVE?
- Gold tokens only useful when 1 gem short on prestige purchase
- No prestige cards currently within 1 gold of affordability
- Wastes turn without advancing score in prestige race

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:
Purchasing L2_60 immediately:
1. **Advance to 14 prestige** - Only 1 point from victory at 15
2. **Opponent needs 2 more prestige; I need 1** - First-mover advantage in race
3. **Next prestige source (ANY card ≥1 prestige) wins** - Whether prestige card or noble
4. **Opponent prestige-locked** - Cannot counter this turn, must accumulate tokens
5. **Empty board restricts both players** - But my 1-point requirement beats opponent's 2-point requirement
6. **Token efficiency** - Spend exactly BLUE×2, free 2 slots for future accumulation. Gain GREEN bonus for optionality.

WINNING TRAJECTORY:
- Post-purchase: I'm 14-13 (1-point lead, need only +1 to win)
- Opponent's turn: Likely token accumulation (prestige blocked)
- Next 1-2 turns: First player to acquire ANY prestige source (card or noble) reaches 15 and WINS
- With opponent prestige-locked and my smaller requirement, victory is secured

CONCLUSION:
Purchase L2_60 NOW. This move is mandatory to break the 13-13 tie and reach 14 prestige, putting me just 1 point away from victory (15). With opponent prestige-locked and requiring 2 more prestige vs. my 1, this establishes a decisive winning position in the endgame prestige race.

Turn 30 - Player 1's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am at 13 points and opponent is at 14 points. Opponent needs just 1 more point to win. I must reach 15 points immediately. I can purchase L2_56 (2 points) face-up on the board. 

Cost analysis:
- L2_56 cost: RED=5, BLACK=3
- My bonuses: RED=4, BLACK=3, WHITE=1
- Effective cost: RED=1, BLACK=0  
- My tokens: RED=1, BLACK=0

I can afford this exactly with my RED token, scoring 2 points to reach exactly 15 points and win the game. This is my only immediate winning path since RED tokens are unavailable on the board (RED=0) and I cannot rely on taking tokens for a future turn. The opponent has 2 reserved cards but cannot purchase them with their current token composition. I must act now.
