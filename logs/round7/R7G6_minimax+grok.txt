Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: As first player with no resources, I need to build a foundation. L1_21 is an excellent opening choice: it gives a WHITE bonus for future development while only costing RED:2 and BLACK:1 - very affordable early-game. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLUE tokens is my optimal opening action because: (1) these 3 colors match the L1_13 card I can afford immediately if needed, (2) they cover diverse requirements for future card purchases, (3) I start with 0 tokens so I can take 3 without returning any. This gives me flexibility to either purchase L1_13 next turn or continue gathering tokens for higher-level cards. The board has 4+ of each color, so all tokens are available.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_21, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Early in the game on my first turn with no tokens or cards. Opponent has reserved a cheap L1_21 (red 2, black 1) and has 1 gold. To match pace and get a valuable gold joker while securing a cheap Tier 1 card, reserve L1_37 (cost: blue 2, green 1; bonus: red; 0 pt). This is efficient: total cost 3 gems. Red bonus will help reduce costs on cards like L2_57 (red 5 -> 4 with bonus) and L2_44 (red 3 -> 2). Next turn, take 2 blue; then purchase using 2 blue tokens + gold for green. Prevents opponent from reserving it. Board has all tokens available. Cannot purchase yet, taking tokens would not allow a purchase next turn either, but this secures card + gold.

======================================================================================

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have a reserved card L1_21 that costs RED:2, BLACK:1 and gives a WHITE bonus. To purchase it, I need 2 RED and 1 BLACK tokens. I currently have 0 tokens plus 1 GOLD (from reserving). With GOLD, I can substitute for one missing color, so I need to gather most of the required tokens myself.

Taking RED, BLACK, and WHITE tokens is optimal because:
1. RED and BLACK are directly needed for L1_21
2. WHITE will help with future WHITE-bonus cards or nobles
3. I have 0 tokens total, so I can take 3 without needing to return any
4. After this turn, I'll have RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1, GOLD:1 - enough to buy L1_21 (using GOLD for the 2nd RED)

L1_13 (BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2) is still visible and could be a backup purchase, but L1_21 is already in my reserved hand and costs fewer high-demand tokens. Taking 3 different colors (not 2 of same color) is valid since all colors have 4+ tokens on board.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GLD=1}
Reasoning: This is my second turn. I have 1 gold token and reserved L1_37 (cost: blue 2, green 1; bonus: red). Plan is to acquire tokens to purchase it next turn. Cannot purchase anything now with only 1 gold. Cannot take 2 blue yet as primary, but better to take 3 different for efficiency: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 red (all available: blue 4, green 4, red 3). After taking: tokens = gold 1, blue 1, green 1, red 1 (total 4 <=10, no return). Next turn, purchase L1_37 using blue 1 + gold (as blue) + green 1, left with red 1 token + red bonus. This is better than taking 2 blue (would leave 0 tokens after purchase). Secures cheap card with useful red bonus for future cards like L2_57 (red 5 ->4), L2_44 (red 3->2). Opponent cannot take 2 red (only 3 available <4). No better immediate buys or reserves; progress engine.

======================================================================================

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase my reserved card L1_21 right now! With my current tokens (RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1, GOLD:1), I have enough to buy it:
- RED:1 + GOLD:1 = 2 RED (covers cost of RED:2)
- BLACK:1 = 1 BLACK (covers cost of BLACK:1)

This gives me my first WHITE bonus, which is excellent for future development. The purchase is optimal because:
1. I shouldn't hoard tokens when I have an affordable purchase available
2. The WHITE bonus helps with nobles (N10 requires WHITE:3) and future card purchases
3. I'm the first player and need to start building my engine quickly

After this purchase, I'll have WHITE bonus to help with future purchases. The opponent has only taken 1 RED token, and the board still shows 2 RED available, so they're not blocking me. No need to reserve or take tokens when I can immediately purchase a card that advances my strategy.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 3: Executing the plan from previous turns. I have tokens BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, GOLD:1 and reserved L1_37 (cost BLUE:2, GREEN:1; bonus RED; 0pt). I can purchase it immediately: use BLUE token + GOLD (joker as second BLUE) + GREEN token. Exact cost covered, no bonuses needed yet. After purchase: tokens left RED:1 (total 1 <=10), gain RED bonus. This is efficient engine building. No other face-up cards are affordable with current tokens (e.g., L1_13 needs WHITE1 BLACK2, which I lack; L1_1 needs all colors; others costlier). Cannot buy opponent's reserved or purchased cards. Buying now secures the RED bonus early, which reduces costs on key cards like L2_57 (RED:5 ->4), L2_44 (RED:3->2), L1_34, and nobles N5/N10. Opponent has only WHITE bonus and 1 WHITE token, low threat. Prioritize purchase over taking more tokens or reserving another (already have one reserved). Prevents wasting turns.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2}
Reasoning: I have 3 tokens after purchasing L1_21 and need to continue building my engine. My current bonuses: WHITE:1. My purchased cards: L1_21.

**Analyzing affordable options:**
- L1_13: costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2 → with my WHITE bonus, I need BLACK:2 (I have 0 BLACK)
- L1_1: costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 → with my WHITE bonus, I need BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1
- L1_34: costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 → with my WHITE bonus, I need WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1

**Taking tokens is optimal because:**
1. I need BLACK tokens to afford L1_13 (which costs 2 BLACK)
2. Taking 3 different colors prevents overspecializing in one color
3. Board shows 3+ of each color available
4. After taking, I'll have 6 tokens total, leaving room for future turns

**My choice: take BLACK, GREEN, and BLUE tokens**
- BLACK is essential for L1_13 (need 2 more)
- GREEN and BLUE cover diverse requirements for future cards (L1_1 needs GREEN, L1_34 needs both)
- This gives me WHITE:1, GREEN:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 - 4 tokens total

Next turn I can either purchase L1_13 (if I take 1 more BLACK) or start working toward another card. The opponent only has 1 RED token and has purchased L1_37 (RED bonus), so they're building similarly. No need to block or rush prestige cards yet.

Taking 3 different colors is valid since all have 4+ tokens available on board.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 4: After successfully purchasing L1_37 last turn, I have RED token:1, RED bonus:1, score:0, no reserved cards. No face-up cards are purchasable with current holdings (e.g., L1_1 requires WHITE1 BLUE1 GREEN1 after RED bonus covers RED; others mismatched or costlier). Board has ample tokens (3 each color). Opponent at 4 tokens (WHITE1 BLUE1 GREEN1 BLACK1), WHITE bonus:1, score:0, low immediate threat but could progress. L2_57 (RED:5 cost, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus) is ideally suited: my RED bonus reduces to RED:4 effective cost. Board RED:3 supports acquiring needed tokens over next turns. Reserving it now secures this high-value card (prevents opponent reserve), grants 1 GOLD joker (5 available, flexible for RED or others), and triggers new L2 reveal. Plan: Next turn (5), TAKE_TOKENS RED1 BLACK1 WHITE1 (board still RED:3; towards N10/N5 nobles). Tokens: RED:2 GOLD:1 WHITE:1 BLACK:1. Turn 6: TAKE_TOKENS RED1 GREEN1 BLUE1 (or adjust), tokens RED:3 GOLD:1 + others. Then PURCHASE L2_57 using RED:3 tokens + GOLD as RED. Efficient path to 2 points while building multi-bonuses/tokens. Superior to taking tokens now (risks opponent reserving L2_57) or reserving lesser cards (e.g., L1_8 BLUE4 harder; L2_44 GREEN-heavy worse). Aligns with prior RED engine strategy.

======================================================================================

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: **Strategic Analysis:**

I have 4 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) and need to continue building my engine. Looking at my options:

**Affordable Cards:**
- L1_1 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 → With my WHITE bonus, I need RED:1 (which I don't have)
- L1_13 costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2 → With my WHITE bonus, I need BLACK:1 more (I have BLACK:1)
- L1_34 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 → With my WHITE bonus, I need WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1

**My Decision: Take 2 RED tokens**

This is optimal because:
1. After taking, I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, RED:2 → I can purchase L1_1 next turn!
2. L1_1 gives a BLACK bonus, which helps with nobles (N5 needs BLACK:4) and future BLACK-cost cards
3. Board has 3 RED tokens available, so taking 2 is valid
4. I'll have 6 tokens total (under the 10 limit), so no return needed

**Why not reserve L2_55?**
- L2_55 costs GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2 → I only have GREEN:1, need RED:4 and BLACK:2 more
- Taking 2 RED tokens this turn gets me closer to both L1_1 (immediate purchase) and L2_55 (long-term goal)
- Getting L1_1's BLACK bonus first is better than waiting 2+ turns for L2_55

**Opponent watch:** They have reserved L2_57 (costs RED:5) and purchased L1_37 (RED bonus). They're also building toward RED-heavy purchases. No need to block them yet - I should focus on my own engine development.

After taking RED tokens, my next turn will be purchasing L1_1 for a BLACK bonus, continuing my balanced engine development.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 RED tokens: only 3 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I need to correct my previous action. Looking at the error and board state:

- Board shows RED:3, which means I CANNOT take 2 tokens of any color (need 4+ for that)
- My current tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, RED:0 (4 total)
- I can take 3 different colors without exceeding the 10 token limit

**Analyzing my options:**
1. **L1_13** (BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2) - with my WHITE bonus, I need BLACK:2
2. **L1_1** (BLACK bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1) - with WHITE bonus, I need all except WHITE
3. **L1_34** (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) - with WHITE bonus, need WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1

**Strategy: Reserve L1_8 and take tokens**
- L1_8 is a BLACK bonus card (prestige 1) with costs BLUE:4
- Reserving gives me a GOLD token which substitutes for any color
- This is smart because: (1) it prevents opponent from taking it, (2) gets me a GOLD token, (3) BLACK bonus helps with nobles and future purchases

**Token selection: WHITE, GREEN, BLUE**
- These are needed for multiple cards I'm targeting
- WHITE: needed for nobles and L1_1/L1_34
- GREEN: needed for L1_1 and L1_34
- BLUE: needed for L1_1 and L1_34
- After this: 7 tokens total, still under limit

With GOLD from reservation, I'll have flexibility to buy cards soon. The opponent has a RED bonus and is working toward expensive cards (L2_57 costs RED:5), so I should focus on diverse resource gathering to stay competitive.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_8, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 5: Following the plan from turn 4. I have RED:1, GOLD:1, RED bonus:1, reserved L2_57 (RED:5 cost -> effective RED:4 with bonus, 2pt WHITE bonus). Cannot purchase yet (need 4 RED equiv., have 2). No face-up cards affordable (e.g., L1_1 needs W1 B1 G1 post-RED bonus; others mismatched). Opponent not threatening immediate purchase (their reserved L1_8 needs B4, they have B1+Gold=2B equiv. + WHITE bonus irrelevant). Board: all colors 3 available. Take 3 different: RED1 (board 3), BLACK1 (3), WHITE1 (3) as planned. After: RED:2, GOLD:1, WHITE:1, BLACK:1 (total 5 <=10, no return). Builds RED for L2_57 purchase (next turn take more RED/GOLD equiv., then buy). Also progresses toward nobles N10 (W3 R3 Black3) and N5 (Black4 Red4). Superior to reserving another (already have key card secured + can only reserve one visible at a time? but plan solid) or taking other combos (this maximizes utility). Prevents opponent from advancing unchecked while engine-building.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens total and can take 3 more without exceeding the 10 token limit. Looking at my options:

**Analyzing potential purchases:**
- L1_34 (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) - with my WHITE bonus, I need WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1
- L1_28 (GREEN bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) - with WHITE bonus, need BLUE:3
- My reserved L1_8 (BLACK bonus, prestige 1) costs BLUE:4 - too expensive now

**Taking tokens is optimal because:**
1. I cannot afford any visible card with my current tokens
2. L1_34 is a strong target - RED bonus helps with nobles (N5 needs RED:4, N10 needs RED:3)
3. L1_28 is also viable but needs 3 BLUE which is a bigger investment
4. Board has enough tokens of each color for taking 3 different colors

**My choice: take WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK tokens**
- WHITE helps with nobles (N10 requires WHITE:3)
- GREEN helps with nobles (N4 requires GREEN:4)
- BLACK helps with nobles (N5 requires BLACK:4, N10 requires BLACK:3)
- After this, I'll have WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2, BLUE:1, GOLD:1 = 8 tokens

This gives me balanced colors for multiple potential purchases. If I take BLUE next turn, I could work toward L1_28. With this distribution, I'm 1 token away from being able to buy L1_34 (just need 1 more WHITE). The opponent has RED:2 and reserved L2_57 (WHITE bonus), so they're building toward expensive cards - I should focus on gathering resources efficiently.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 6: Continuing the plan to purchase reserved L2_57 (RED:5 -> RED:4 effective with RED bonus, 2pt WHITE bonus). Current tokens: WHITE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 6/10). Cannot purchase L2_57 yet (RED:2 + GOLD:1 = 3 RED equiv <4 needed). No face-up cards affordable after RED bonus (e.g., L1_1 needs W1 B1 G1 post-RED; L1_13 W1 Bl2; L2_55 needs G1 R3 Bl2 post-RED, have R3 equiv but no G/Bl2; others worse). Opponent (8 tokens: W2 B1 G2 Bl2 Go1, WHITE bonus) could potentially buy L1_13 next turn (effective Bl2 after WHITE bonus on W1 Bl2 cost, they have Bl2), gaining BLUE bonus (low threat, 0pt), but not urgent. Board: WHITE1 BLUE3 GREEN2 RED2 BLACK1 GOLD3. Cannot take 2 RED (only 2<4 avail). Take 3 different: RED1 (to reach RED:3 + GOLD=4 RED equiv for next purchase), BLUE1, GREEN1 (versatile for L1s/nobles N4, and board allows). After: RED:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 WHITE:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 9<=10, no return). Next turn: PURCHASE L2_57 (RED:3 tokens + GOLD as RED), gain 2pt + WHITE bonus; left with BLUE:1 GREEN:1 WHITE:1 BLACK:1 (diverse, progresses N10 W3 R3 Bl3 with upcoming WHITE bonus + current). Builds engine toward nobles N5/N10 (post-buy: bonuses RED1 WHITE1; tokens support). Superior to other takes (e.g., RED1 WHITE1 BLACK1 exhausts low-supply WHITE/BLACK1, less versatile) or reserving blind (risks delaying points). Secures 2pt next turn while opponent lags (0pt).

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total, so I can take 2 more without exceeding the 10 token limit. I need to evaluate my best move.

**Current Resources:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1
- Bonuses: WHITE:1
- Purchased: L1_21 (WHITE bonus)
- Reserved: L1_8 (BLACK bonus, prestige 1, costs BLUE:4)

**Affordable Cards Right Now:**
- L1_13 (BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2) → I have WHITE:2, BLACK:2 → CAN afford this
- L1_34 (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) → I have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:2 → CAN afford this

**Strategic Analysis:**
Taking RED is optimal because:
1. L1_34 gives a RED bonus which helps with nobles (N5 needs RED:4, N10 needs RED:3)
2. After this turn: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (9 tokens)
3. I can still afford both L1_13 and L1_34 after this move
4. The board has 1 RED available, and I need 2 RED for L1_34, so taking 2 of the same color is valid (requires 4+ on board, which there is)

The opponent has 3 RED tokens already and reserved L2_57 (costs RED:5), indicating they're targeting RED-heavy cards. Taking RED tokens now blocks their strategy while advancing my own path toward nobles.

Taking WHITE+RED or RED+BLUE are alternatives, but 2 RED maximizes synergy with my upcoming purchase of L1_34 and noble requirements.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 RED tokens: only 1 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I made an error in my previous action - I tried to take 2 RED tokens but there's only 1 available on the board. Let me correct this.

**Current state analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (8 total)
- Board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:3
- Cannot take 2 of any color (no color has 4+ available)

**My target cards:**
- L1_34 (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) - with my WHITE bonus, I need WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1
- L1_28 (GREEN bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) - with my WHITE bonus, need BLUE:3

**Strategy:** Take 3 different colors that I need for my targets. I'll take WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK:
- WHITE: Gets me closer to L1_34 requirement
- GREEN: Gets me closer to L1_34 and L1_28 requirements
- BLACK: Gets me closer to L1_34 requirement

After this: WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:1, GOLD:1 = 9 tokens (under 10 limit). This puts me in position to potentially purchase L1_34 next turn if I take the right colors.

The opponent has RED:3 tokens and reserved L2_57 (WHITE bonus, costs RED:5), so they're focusing on RED-heavy strategy. I should continue gathering the diverse tokens I need for my targets.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Analyzing my current situation:**
- I have 8 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1)
- The board has very limited tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1
- I cannot take 3 tokens without returning some since I'm at 8/10
- Board only has 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN, so I cannot take 2 of the same color (need 4+ for that)

**My strategy:**
1. Reserve L1_4 to get a GOLD token (BLACK bonus, costs BLUE:2)
2. This gives me 9 tokens total (8 current - 0 returned + 1 gold = 9)
3. Next turn, I can take 1 more token (staying at 10 max)

**Why reserve L1_4 specifically:**
- It's a BLACK bonus card which helps with nobles (N5 and N10 both need BLACK)
- Costs only 2 BLUE which is affordable with my existing tokens
- Gets me a GOLD token which provides flexibility

**Why not take tokens now:**
- I can only take 1-2 tokens (due to 10 token limit and limited board supply)
- Taking just 1 token is inefficient when I can reserve a card and get a GOLD instead
- Reserving prevents opponent from taking L1_4

After reserving L1_4 and getting the GOLD, I'll be at 9 tokens and can take my final token for L1_34 next turn.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_4, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 7: Executing the plan from turn 6. Current tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 9/10). RED bonus:1. Reserved L2_57 (RED:5 cost -> effective RED:4 with bonus, 2pt WHITE bonus). Can purchase exactly now: RED:3 tokens + GOLD:1 as RED. After: tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (total 4 <=10), gain 2pt + WHITE bonus (now bonuses RED:1 WHITE:1, score:2). Secures first points efficiently, builds toward nobles N10 (W3 R3 Bl3 - WHITE bonus helps W, RED covers R; current tokens start W1 Bl1) and N5 (Bl4 R4). No face-up cards better: e.g., L1_1 (all 1s, 0pt BLACK bonus) affordable post-RED bonus (need W1 B1 G1, have them) but inferior to 2pt + WHITE synergy. L1_13 (W1 Bl2, 0pt BLUE) missing 1 Bl. Others unaffordable/mismatched. Opponent (0pt, WHITE bonus, reserved L1_8 BLUE:4 needing 2 more BLUE equiv.; has B1 Go1=2B, could buy next but 1pt BLACK bonus low threat). Board low tokens but purchase doesn't take any. Prioritize points + engine over taking (next turns build noble/points). Prevents opponent catching up.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total and want to reach 15 prestige points efficiently. My current bonuses: WHITE:1. I own L1_21 (WHITE bonus) and have L1_8 (BLACK bonus, prestige 1) reserved.

**Analyzing my options:**
- I have WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2, BLUE:1, GOLD:1 (8 tokens total)
- L1_34 (RED bonus) costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 - with my WHITE bonus, I need 1 WHITE (have 2), 1 BLUE (have 1), 1 GREEN (have 2), 1 BLACK (have 2) - I can buy it NOW!
- But the board shows RED:4 available, so I can take 2 RED tokens first (max is 4+ for taking 2 of same color)

**Taking 2 RED tokens is optimal because:**
1. I cannot take 3 different colors (WHITE has only 1, GREEN has only 1)
2. RED is needed for L1_34 and for nobles (N5 needs RED:4, N10 needs RED:3)
3. After taking 2 RED, I'll have 9 tokens - I can still buy L1_34 next turn and have 7 tokens remaining (good for future purchases)
4. The opponent has only 4 tokens total and no RED bonuses, so they're not competing for RED

**Next turn I can:**
- Purchase L1_34 for RED bonus, giving me WHITE:1, RED:1 bonuses
- This helps toward nobles N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4) and N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)

The board allows taking 2 RED since 4 are available. After this action, I'll have WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2, BLUE:1, RED:2, GOLD:1 = 9 tokens total.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 8: After purchasing L2_57 last turn, score:2, bonuses WHITE:1 RED:1, tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (total 5/10), no reserved. No points cards affordable yet (L2s/L3s too costly even with bonuses). But two L1 bonuses affordable: L1_1 (cost all 1s -> RED bonus covers RED, spend WHITE1 BLUE1 GREEN1 exactly, gain BLACK bonus, 0pt, left BLACK1 token); L1_34 (W2 BLUE1 GREEN1 BLACK1 -> WHITE bonus covers 1W, RED irrelevant, spend WHITE1 BLUE1 GREEN1 BLACK1 exactly, gain extra RED bonus, left 0 tokens). Prefer L1_1: BLACK bonus diversifies engine towards N10 (now W1 R1 Bl1; need +2W +2R +2Bl) and N5 (Bl1 R1; need +3Bl +3R), leaves BLACK1 token (useful), denies opponent who can also afford it (they have ample for L1_1 post-WHITE bonus). L1_34 leaves 0 tokens (bad for flexibility), extra RED less balanced than BLACK now. Opponent at 10 tokens/0pt/WHITE1 bonus, reserved L1_8 (BLUE4, needs 2 more BLUE equiv.; can take 2 BLUE but must return 2 since max10), could buy L1_13 (Bl2 post-WHITE on W1) or L1_1 next turn gaining BLUE/BLACK bonus (low pt threat). Board low tokens (cannot take 2-same). Taking 3 diff (e.g., WHITE1 BLUE1 RED1 -> total8) builds stock but no immediate buy, delays engine vs buying bonus now. Reserving (e.g., L2_44 R3->2eff G5 2pt BLACK) good but risks opponent buying L1_1 meanwhile; better secure BLACK bonus/deny first. Post-buy: bonuses W1 R1 Bl1, BLACK1 token, score2; next take/build towards L1_13/L2 BLACKs/nobles. Efficient progression while opponent lags.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 9 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1). Taking any tokens would exceed the 10 token limit, so I cannot take tokens without returning some.

**Analyzing my purchasing options:**
- L1_34 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 - with my WHITE bonus, I have everything I need! This is affordable NOW.
- L1_17 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 - I'm missing BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (have none of these).
- My reserved L1_8 costs BLUE:4 - too expensive still.

**Decision: Purchase L1_34**
- This gives me a RED bonus, which helps with nobles N5 (needs BLACK:4, RED:4) and N10 (needs WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3).
- L1_34 has no prestige points, but the RED bonus is valuable for engine building.
- After purchase, I'll have WHITE:1, RED:1 bonuses.

**After this purchase:**
- My tokens will be: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (7 tokens total)
- I'll be in a better position to work toward nobles.
- The opponent has bonuses in WHITE, RED, and BLACK already, so they're competing for similar cards.

Purchasing is better than returning tokens, and L1_34 is a strong strategic choice for building my engine toward noble tiles.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current: score 2 (purchased L1_37 RED bonus, L2_57 2pt WHITE bonus, L1_1 BLACK bonus), bonuses W1 R1 Bl1, tokens W1 Bl1 (2/10), no reserved. Only face-up purchasable: L1_13 (W1 Bl2 -> eff W0 Bl1 after W1/Bl1 bonuses, spend Bl1 token, gain BLUE bonus 0pt). L1_34 (W2 B1 G1 Bl1 -> eff W1 B1 G1 Bl0 after bonuses, but missing B1 G1 tokens). Opponent (score 0, WHITE2 bonuses from L1_21/L1_17, reserved L1_8 B4 1pt BLACK bonus, tokens W2 G1 R1 Bl1 Go1 total 7/10) can purchase L1_34 now (eff W0 B1 G1 Bl1 after WHITE2, spend G1 Bl1 Go1-as-B exactly, gain RED bonus) or L1_13 (eff Bl2, spend Bl1 Go1-as-Bl). Cannot buy reserved L1_8 yet (<4 B equiv). Nobles require bonus cards: N10 (W3 R3 Bl3) I'm at W1 R1 Bl1 (need 2 each); N5 (Bl4 R4) at Bl1 R1 (need 3 each). L1_34 provides crucial extra RED bonus toward both, diversifies engine. To secure before opponent potentially takes it: RESERVE L1_34 (visible L1), gain GOLD1 (avail4), tokens to W1 Bl1 Go1 (3/10). Prevents opponent buy. Next turn: TAKE_TOKENS BLUE1 GREEN1 RED1 (board BLUE4 GREEN3 RED3 allows), tokens W1 B1 G1 R1 Bl1 Go1 (7/10), then PURCHASE L1_34 (spend W1 B1 G1 tokens; bonuses cover extra W/Bl), gain RED2 bonus, left R1 Bl1 Go1 (versatile for future). Efficient: 1pt engine card secured cheaply, noble progress (R2), GOLD utility, new L1 reveal. Superior to PURCHASE L1_13 (undesired BLUE bonus, leaves L1_34 open to opponent gaining RED); TAKE_TOKENS B1 G1 R1 (builds stock to 5 but opponent buys L1_34 intervening); reserving higher L2/L3 (e.g. L2_44 G5 R3 2pt Bl bonus eff G5 R2 too costly to acquire quickly, risks stall). Aligns with prior engine (now W1 R2 Bl1 post-buy) toward N10/N5 while opponent lags at 0pt.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens and can take 3 more without hitting the 10-token limit. My current bonuses: WHITE:2. My purchased cards: L1_21, L1_17. My reserved: L1_8 (BLACK bonus, prestige 1, costs BLUE:4).

**Analyzing affordable cards:**
- L1_7 (BLACK bonus, costs GREEN:3) - need 3 GREEN (have 1)
- L1_8 (my reservation, costs BLUE:4) - need 4 BLUE (have 0)

None are affordable yet. My tokens: WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1, BLUE:0.

**Taking tokens is optimal because:**
1. I need BLUE for my reserved L1_8 (costs BLUE:4) and for L1_13 (costs BLACK:2, WHITE:1)
2. I also need WHITE to maintain strong purchasing power (have 2 now, good)
3. Taking 3 different colors gives me flexibility for multiple potential purchases

**My choice: take WHITE, GREEN, and BLUE tokens**
- WHITE maintains my strong bonus color (need 2 more to reach WHITE:4)
- GREEN helps with nobles (N4 needs GREEN:4) and future card costs
- BLUE is critical for my reserved L1_8 (need 4 total)

After this, I'll have WHITE:3, GREEN:2, BLUE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens exactly.

Next turn I can purchase L1_13 (costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2 - with WHITE:3 bonus, I need 1 BLACK which I have) and have 8 tokens remaining. This gives me a BLACK bonus to work toward nobles N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4) and N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3).

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My tokens W1 Bl1 Go1 (3/10), reserved L1_34 (RED bonus 0pt, cost W2 B1 G1 Bl1 → eff W1 B1 G1 Bl0 with bonuses W1 R1 Bl1). Cannot purchase yet (missing B1 G1; Go1 covers only one). Face-up affordable: only L1_13 (eff Bl1, spend Bl1 token, gain BLUE bonus 0pt), but BLUE skews engine away from N5/N10 (Bl4 R4 / W3 R3 Bl3); better prioritize reserved RED bonus for noble progress (R1→2). No other face-up affordable (L1_7 G3 no; L1_28/11/L2s lack tokens/bonuses). Cannot reserve more (already have one; game limits to one reserved). Opponent (9/10 tokens W3 B1 G2 R1 Bl1 Go1, WHITE2 bonuses, reserved L1_8 B4) can buy L1_13 (eff Bl2, spend Bl1 Go1-as-Bl, gain BLUE) or L1_7 (G3 via G2 Go1-as-G, gain BLACK) or L1_11 (eff G2 R2 via G2 R1 Go1-as-R? W eff0), gaining low-pt bonuses but no points threat. Board: W0 B3 G2 R3 Bl2 Go3. Take 3 different: BLUE1 GREEN1 RED1 (board allows; cannot 2-same, no W). After: W1 B1 G1 R1 Bl1 Go1 (6/10, no return). Next turn: PURCHASE L1_34 (spend W1 B1 G1 exactly; bonuses cover extras), gain RED2 bonus (W1 R2 Bl1), left R1 Bl1 Go1 (versatile for nobles/L2s). Progresses N10 (need 2W 1R 2Bl) / N5 (need 3Bl 2R); reveals new L1. Superior to buying L1_13 (delays RED, undesired BLUE, opponent grabs another bonus); other takes (e.g., B1 R1 Bl1 redundant Bl, misses G for purchase); blind reserve risks junk delaying points. Secures engine while opponent at 0pt.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 9 tokens and can take 1 more token without exceeding the 10-token limit. Looking at my situation:

My bonuses: WHITE:2
My purchased: L1_21, L1_17
My reserved: L1_8 (BLACK bonus, prestige 1, costs BLUE:4)

**Analyzing my options:**
- I need BLUE tokens for my reserved L1_8 (need 4 total, have 0)
- The board has BLUE:2 available, so I can take at most 2 BLUE
- Taking 2 BLUE tokens would give me 11 total, exceeding the limit

**Best action: RESERVE L1_28**
- L1_28 is a GREEN bonus card (prestige 0) with costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1
- By reserving, I get a GOLD token which substitutes for any color
- This is strategic because: (1) it gets me a GOLD token, (2) GREEN bonus helps toward noble N4 (needs GREEN:4, BLUE:4), (3) it blocks opponent from taking this card
- After this action, I'll have WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 = 10 tokens exactly

This maintains my token balance while adding flexibility with another GOLD token. I can continue working toward my reserved L1_8 (BLUE:4) in future turns.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Executing the plan from previous turns. Current tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 6/10). Bonuses: WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:1. Reserved: L1_34 (cost W2 B1 G1 Bl1 → effective W1 B1 G1 Bl0 after bonuses). Can purchase exactly: spend W1 B1 G1 tokens (bonuses cover extras). After: tokens RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 3/10), gain RED bonus (now W1 R2 Bl1), score:2. Progresses nobles N10 (W3 R3 Bl3 → need 2W 1R 2Bl) and N5 (Bl4 R4 → need 3Bl 2R). Reveals new L1 card. No better face-up purchases: L1_13 (eff Bl1 spend Bl1, BLUE bonus undesired, skews engine); L1_7/11/3/L2s unaffordable (e.g., L1_7 G3 > G1; L1_3 eff B2 R1 W0, need B2 R1 have B1 R1 Go-as-B but prefer reserved). Cannot reserve (already have one). Board low: W0 B2 G1 R2 Bl2 Go2; taking 3 diff (e.g., B1 G1 R1) would go to 9/10 but delays engine/points reveal vs buying now. Opponent at 10tokens/0pt/WHITE2, two reserved (L1_8 B4 1pt BLACK; L1_28 W1 B3 G1 GREEN), can buy L1_13 (eff W0 Bl2 spend Bl1 Go-as-Bl, BLUE) or L1_7 (G3 via G2 Go-as-G, BLACK) or L1_3 (eff W0 B2 R1 via WHITE2/B1 Go-as-B R1, BLACK), gaining bonuses but no points/noble threat yet (their engine WHITE-heavy, lacks R/Bl depth). Secures second RED bonus, noble progress, while opponent lags at 0pt. Next: take tokens toward L2 BLACKs/nobles or points.

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2), which means I cannot take tokens without returning some. My options are to purchase, reserve, or return tokens.

**Analyzing purchases:**
- L1_13: costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2 - I have WHITE:3, BLACK:1, need 1 more BLACK
- L1_7: costs GREEN:3 - I have GREEN:2, need 1 more GREEN
- L1_11: costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2 - with bonuses, need GREEN:2, RED:1 (I have GREEN:2, RED:1)
- L1_3: costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 - with bonuses, need BLUE:2, RED:1 (I have BLUE:1, RED:1)
- My reservations: L1_8 costs BLUE:4 (need 3 more), L1_28 needs GREEN:1, BLUE:2

I can afford L1_11 if I return tokens, but it's not optimal since L1_11 gives no prestige and has weak bonuses. Similarly, L1_3 costs 2 BLUE which are scarce.

**Best action: RESERVE L1_7 from LEVEL_1 deck**
- L1_7 is a BLACK bonus card (prestige 0) with costs GREEN:3
- By reserving, I get a GOLD token and block my opponent from this card
- After reserving, I'll have 11 tokens, so I'll return RED=1 to stay at 10
- I already have 2 WHITE bonuses, so 4 WHITE is still manageable

L1_7's BLACK bonus helps toward nobles N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4) and N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3). I can purchase it later when I have more GREEN tokens, or use it as a blocking move. The GOLD token gives me flexibility for future expensive purchases like my reserved L1_8 (BLUE:4) or L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1).

Reasoning: Current tokens: RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 3/10), bonuses WHITE:1 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:2, no reserved. Low tokens, prioritize taking 3 different to set up immediate high-value purchase next turn. Target L2_55 (2pt WHITE bonus, helps N10 W3): effective cost after bonuses G1 R2 BLACK1 (R4-2=2, BLACK2-1=1, G1). Board allows WHITE1 BLUE1 GREEN1 (W2 B3 G2 available). After take: tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (6/10). Next turn: buy L2_55 spending GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1-as-second-RED exactly, left WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (2/10), score:4, bonuses WHITE:2 RED:2 BLACK:1. Strong progress: +2pt, W2 toward N10 (need 1W 1R 2BLACK), versatile leftovers. Opponent (9/10 tokens incl. GOLD:3, WHITE:2 bonuses, score:0) can buy reserved L1_8 (BLUE:4 equiv. via BLACK:1 + GOLD:3) for 1pt BLACK bonus (score:1, bonuses WHITE:2 BLACK:1), or face-ups like L1_3 (BLACK bonus), but cannot reach L2_55/L2 BLACKs (insufficient RED/BLACK equiv.). Post-take board: W1 B2 G1 R3 BLACK:2 GOLD:1, doesn't hinder them much but advances me faster. No current buys better (L1_13 BLUE undesired; others unaffordable e.g. L1_3 needs W1 B2). Reserving L2_44/L2_43 (BLACK 2pt) possible but delays points (their costs G5 R1/B1 G4 high, need heavy tokening); opponent can't buy them now anyway. Other takes (e.g. B1 G1 R1) work for L2_55 too but WHITE/BLUE adds versatility for future W/N10 or general. Efficient: points surge to 4, noble setup, opponent lags at ~1pt.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=1, GLD=3}
Reasoning: I'm at 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:3) and cannot take tokens without returning. I need to evaluate my options:

**Purchasing options I can afford:**
- L1_13: costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2 - I have WHITE:2, BLACK:1, need 1 more BLACK
- L1_11: costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2 - need RED:2 (have 0), can't afford
- L1_3: costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 - need BLUE:2 (have 1), RED:1 (have 0), can't afford
- L1_15: costs BLACK:3 - need BLACK:2 (have 1), can't afford
- My reservations: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3) - none affordable

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 2 - I need to prioritize point-scoring cards
- L1_13 is affordable with my bonuses (WHITE:2 means I pay 0 WHITE, only need 1 WHITE and 2 BLACK)
- This gives me a BLUE bonus which helps with nobles (N4 needs GREEN:4, BLUE:4) and L1_28 reservation (needs BLUE:3)
- The board shows BLUE:2 available, and L1_13 is on the board - I should take it before opponent does

**Best action: PURCHASE L1_13**
- Cost: WHITE:1, BLACK:2
- After purchase: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:3 = 7 tokens
- I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:1 bonuses - continuing to build my engine
- This keeps me on track toward nobles N4 (GREEN:4, BLUE:4) and N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)

Taking tokens would be wasteful at 9 tokens, and reserving gives no immediate benefit. Purchasing L1_13 is the most efficient use of my turn.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Executing the plan from the previous turn. Current tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 6/10). Bonuses: WHITE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. Score:2, no reserved. L2_55 (WHITE 2pt bonus, cost G1 R4 Bl2) effective cost after bonuses: G1, R:4-2=2, Bl:2-1=1. Spend exactly GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1-as-second-RED. After purchase: tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (2/10), score:4, bonuses WHITE:2 RED:2 BLACK:1. Strong noble progress: N10 now needs 1W 1R 2Bl (from W2 R2 Bl1). Reveals new L2 card. No other face-up affordable (L1_11 needs G2; L1_3 needs W1 BLUE2; L1_15 Bl2; L1_22 BLUE2 Bl1; L2_41 needs W2 B2 G2; etc.). Opponent (score 0, WHITE2 BLUE1 bonuses, tokens W2 B1 G2 Go2 total7/10, 3 reserved) can buy L1_8 (BLUE4 equiv: BLUE bonus1 + B1 + Go2=4, gain 1pt BLACK bonus to score1 WHITE2 BLACK1), but cannot reach L2_55 (lacks BLACK/RED depth) or other L2s. Board tokens low (W1 B2 G1 R3 Bl3 Go2); taking 3 diff (e.g., W1 R1 Bl1 to 9/10) delays 2pt purchase vs buying now for points lead (4-1). Reserving L2_44/L2_43 (BLACK 2pt) risks opponent buying L1_8 meanwhile, and their high G costs delay vs immediate 2pt. Prioritize points surge and noble setup while opponent lags.

======================================================================================

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I have 8 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:3) and can take up to 2 more without exceeding 10.

**My situation:**
- I have 0 prestige points vs opponent's 4 - I need to catch up!
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1
- My reserved cards: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3)

**Analyzing purchases:**
- L1_11: costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2 - need RED:2 (have 0)
- L1_15: costs BLACK:3 - need BLACK:3 (have 0)
- L1_22: costs BLUE:2, BLACK:2 - need BLUE:1, BLACK:2 (have BLUE:1)
- L2_43: costs BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2 - need BLUE:0 (have 1), GREEN:2, RED:2 (have 0)
- My reservations are all too expensive

**Taking tokens is optimal because:**
1. I have no RED tokens and need them for L1_11 (WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2) and nobles N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3) and N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4)
2. I have no BLACK tokens and need them for L1_15 (BLACK:3) and nobles N10 and N5
3. I need to work toward L2_43 which needs RED:2
4. Taking 2 RED and 1 BLACK would give me 11 tokens, so I need to return 3 tokens

**Strategy: Take 2 RED and 1 BLACK, return 3 GOLD**
- After this: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 = 8 tokens
- This gives me RED tokens for L1_11 and BLACK tokens for L1_15
- Next turn I could purchase L1_15 (BLACK:3) with my BLACK:1 and potentially 2 GOLD if needed

This move builds toward catching up on prestige points while maintaining flexibility for future purchases.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: **Analyzing my situation:**
- Current tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:3 = 9 tokens total
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1
- Purchased: L1_21 (WHITE), L1_17 (WHITE), L1_13 (BLUE)
- Reserved: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3)
- Score: 0 (opponent has 4)

**Purchasing options I can afford:**
- L1_11: costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2 - with WHITE:2 bonus, I need WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2 (have GREEN:2, RED:0)
- L1_15: costs BLACK:3 - need BLACK:2 (have 1)
- None of my reservations are affordable yet

**Token Analysis:**
- Board has WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:4 available
- I need RED for L1_11 (costs 2 RED) and L1_3 (costs 1 RED)
- I also need more GREEN for my L1_7 reservation (needs 3 GREEN total, have 2)
- Taking 2 RED would give me 11 tokens, requiring 1 return

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS - RED:2 (return 1 to stay at 10)**
- I need RED tokens for L1_11 and L1_3
- L1_11 is a BLUE bonus card (0 prestige) that costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2
- With my WHITE:2 bonus, L1_11 would cost only 1 actual WHITE (plus GREEN:2, RED:2)
- The BLUE bonus from L1_11 helps toward noble N4 (needs GREEN:4, BLUE:4)
- Taking 2 RED now positions me to potentially purchase L1_11 next turn
- After this action: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:3, RED:1 (10 tokens)

Taking 2 RED is the most efficient way to work toward my first affordable purchase while staying within the token limit.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=1}, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.
Reasoning: I'm at 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:3) and cannot take tokens without returning. My previous attempt to purchase L1_13 was invalid, so I need to re-evaluate my options.

**Analyzing purchasing options:**
- L1_11 costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2 - with WHITE:2 bonus, need GREEN:2, RED:1 (I have GREEN:2, RED:0)
- L1_3 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 - with WHITE:2 bonus, need BLUE:2, RED:1 (I have BLUE:1, RED:0)
- L1_15 costs BLACK:3 - need BLACK:2 (have 1)
- My reservations: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3) - none affordable

None of my purchases or reservations are affordable with my current tokens.

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 4 - I need to prioritize point-scoring cards
- The opponent has WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 bonuses and is scoring points
- My current strategy is focused on building BLACK bonuses through L1_8 and L1_7 reservations
- Taking tokens would be wasteful at 9 tokens

**Best action: RESERVE L2_44 from LEVEL_2 deck**
- L2_44 is a BLACK bonus card with 2 prestige points (highest available on board)
- Cost: GREEN:5, RED:3 - expensive but gives 2 points
- By reserving, I get a GOLD token which substitutes for any color
- This blocks opponent from taking this high-value card and gives me flexibility
- After reserving, I'll have 10 tokens (9 current + 1 GOLD from reserve)

Reserving L2_44 is strategic because: (1) it gives me a chance at 2 prestige points, (2) it blocks opponent, (3) the BLACK bonus aligns with my reserved L1_8 and L1_7, (4) GOLD token gives flexibility for expensive purchases.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_44, deckLevel=LEVEL_2, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Cannot reserve more than 3 cards.. Skipping turn.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current tokens: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (2/10), bonuses WHITE:2 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:4, no reserved. Strong lead (4-0), N10 progress (W2/3 R2/3 Bl1/3, need 1W 1R 2Bl), N5 (Bl1/4 R2/4). No immediate purchases possible (e.g., L1_3 eff BLUE2 but only BLUE1; L1_22 eff BLUE2 BLACK1 short BLUE; L2_45 eff WHITE3 short1; others higher). Opponent (7/10 tokens, W2 BLUE1 bonuses, score0, 3 reserved) likely buys reserved L1_8 (BLUE4 via BLUE1 token + GOLD2) for 1pt BLACK bonus (score1, bonuses W2 BLUE1 BLACK1), progressing their engine but still lags (cannot easily reach L2 BLACKs, lacks RED/BLACK depth). Board ample BLACK4 RED4 WHITE1 BLUE2 GREEN2 GOLD3. To surge points + noble: RESERVE L2_45 (BLACK 2pt bonus, cost WHITE5 eff WHITE3 after W2). Gain GOLD1, tokens W1 B1 Go1 (3/10). Secures before opponent potentially eyes it. Next: TAKE WHITE1 BLACK1 RED1 (board WHITE1 BLACK4 RED4 allows) → W2 B1 Go1 R1 Bl1 (6/10), PURCHASE L2_45 (spend W2 Go1-as-W for eff3), left B1 R1 Bl1 (3/10), score:6, bonuses W2 R2 Bl2. N10 now needs 1W 1R 1Bl (excellent progress). Reveals new L2. Superior to TAKE_TOKENS 3diff (e.g., W1 B1 Bl1 → W2 B2 Bl1 (5/10), enables next buy L1_3/L1_22 for 0pt BLACK/WHITE bonus but no points surge, risks opponent progress); TAKE 2 BLACK (to Bl2, enables L1_15 BLUE undesired); blind reserve (risks poor card). Prioritizes 2pt + key BLACK bonus while opponent at ~1pt.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 9 tokens and can take up to 1 more without exceeding the 10-token limit. My bonuses are WHITE:2, BLUE:1.

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 4 - I need to prioritize point-scoring cards
- L1_11 (BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2) would be a good purchase but I need 2 RED tokens
- L1_22 (WHITE bonus, costs BLUE:2, BLACK:2) is another option but I need BLUE:2, BLACK:2

**Noble Progression:**
- N10 requires WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3 for 3 prestige points
- My current tokens: WHITE:2, RED:0, BLACK:0

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS**
- Take WHITE, RED, and BLACK tokens (1 each)
- This progresses toward N10 noble requirements
- After taking: WHITE:3, RED:1, BLACK:1 - much closer to N10
- Board has ample tokens: WHITE:1, RED:4, BLACK:4 available

This is the most efficient path toward earning prestige points through nobles.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current tokens: WHITE1 BLUE1 GOLD1 (3/10), bonuses W2 R2 Bl1, score4, reserved L2_45 (eff WHITE3). Cannot purchase: L2_45 short 1 WHITE equiv (W1+Go1=2<3); no face-ups affordable (L1_11 needs G2; L1_3 B2>1; L1_15/22/ L2s higher). Board WHITE0 B2 G2 R3 Bl3 Go2 (>=4 none for 2-same). Opponent 10/10 tokens W3 B1 G2 R1 Bl1 Go2 bonuses W2 B1 score0, 3 reserved; likely buys L1_8 (eff B3 pay B1 Go2 exactly, gain 1pt BLACK bonus to score1 W2 B1 Bl1, left W3 G2 R1 Bl1 7/10, board B3 Go4). TAKE 3 diff BLUE1 RED1 BLACK1 (avail): after W1 B2 R1 Bl1 Go1 (6/10). Next turn: if opp buys L1_8, buy L1_22 (eff B2 Bl1 pay B2 Bl1 exact, +WHITE bonus to W3 R2 Bl1 score4, left W1 R1 Go1 3/10); if opp buys L1_22 (eff B1 Bl2 pay B1 Bl1 Go1 possible, +WHITE3), buy L1_3 (eff B2 pay B2 exact, +BLACK to W2 R2 Bl2 score4, left W1 R1 Bl1 Go1); if opp buys L1_3 (eff B1 R1 pay B1 R1 possible, +BLACK), buy L1_22 (pay B2 Bl1, +WHITE to W3 R2 Bl1, left W1 R1 Go1). Guaranteed bonus progress on N10 (to W3 R2 Bl1 or W2 R2 Bl2), versatile leftovers, reveals L1. L2_45 secured for later (2pt Bl when WHITE/Go avail). Beats reserving (delays bonus, risks junk, extra Go not immediately buyable for L2_45 without more turns); blind risky. Efficient noble setup (N10 near), lead maintained (4 vs ~1), opponent lags points/no nobles.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: **Analyzing my situation:**
- I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1
- Score: 0, Opponent: 4

**Evaluating purchases:**
- L1_11 (BLUE bonus, 0 pts): costs WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2
  - With WHITE:2 bonus, need 0 WHITE, 2 GREEN, 2 RED
  - I have GREEN:2, RED:1 → can pay with 1 GOLD substituting for RED
- L1_22 (WHITE bonus, 0 pts): costs BLUE:2, BLACK:2
  - With bonuses, need 0 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 BLACK
  - I have BLUE:1, BLACK:1 → need 2 more, can't afford
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, 0 pts): costs BLACK:3
  - With BLUE:1 bonus, need 3 BLACK
  - I have BLACK:1 → need 2 more, can't afford

**Best action: PURCHASE L1_11**
- This gives me another BLUE bonus, progressing toward noble N4 (GREEN:4, BLUE:4)
- Using my existing GREEN:2 and RED:1, plus 1 GOLD for the second RED
- Token efficiency: all my GREEN and RED tokens are consumed productively
- After purchase: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 7 tokens

This is more efficient than reserving (which would give me a GOLD but waste tokens) or returning tokens. L1_11 is on the board now but won't be available forever.

Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: tokens W1 B2 R1 Bl1 Go1 (6/10), bonuses W2 R2 Bl1, score 4, reserved L2_45 (eff W3). Opponent tokens W3 B1 Bl1 Go1 (7/10), bonuses W2 B2, score 0, reserved L1_8/L1_28/L1_7; can buy L1_8 (eff B2 pay B1 Go1) for 1pt Bl bonus (to score 1, W2 B2 Bl1, left W3 Bl1 4/10), cannot buy face-ups (L1_22 eff Bl2>1; L1_3 R1=0; etc.). Face-ups affordable: L1_3 (eff B2 pay B2 exact, +Bl to W2 R2 Bl2, left W1 R1 Bl1 Go1 4/10); L1_22 (eff B2 Bl1 pay B2 Bl1 exact, +W to W3 R2 Bl1, left W1 R1 Go1 3/10); L1_16 (eff R2 pay R1 Go1, +1pt Blue bonus undesired, left W1 B2 Bl1 4/10 score5). Cannot buy reserved (W1+Go1=2<3). Executing plan: opponent likely buys L1_8, so purchase L1_22 for WHITE bonus (W3 R2 Bl1, N10 progress to 3/3W 2/3R 1/3Bl, need R1 Bl2 more). Reveals new L1. Superior to L1_3 (symmetric Bl2 progress) as plan/W completion first; beats L1_16 (1pt but undesired Blue skews engine, misses noble setup); no take (delays bonus/reveal, opponent progresses to 1pt unhindered); board W0 B1 G4 R3 Bl2 Go3 allows future takes. Post-buy: low tokens 3/10 for safe take 3 diff (e.g. G1 R1 Bl1 to 6/10) toward L2_45 (still need 1W equiv, await board W/Gold) or other L2 BLACKs/nobles/points. Secures N10 edge (opp W2 R0 Bl1 post-buy far), maintains lead (4-1), L2_45 safe.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Analyzing my situation:**
- I'm at 6 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0, Opponent: 4
- Need to reach 15 prestige points

**Evaluating my options:**
- Taking tokens: I'm at 6 tokens, can take up to 4 more without exceeding 10
- Purchasing L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1pt, costs RED:4): Too expensive - I have 0 RED
- My reserved cards: L1_8 (needs BLUE:4), L1_28 (needs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (needs GREEN:3)
- None of my reserved cards are affordable

**Noble Strategy:**
- N10 (3pts): requires WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3 - I have WHITE:2, RED:0, BLACK:1
- N5 (3pts): requires BLACK:4, RED:4 - I have BLACK:1, RED:0
- N4 (3pts): requires GREEN:4, BLUE:4 - I have GREEN:0, BLUE:2

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS**
- Take 1 RED and 1 BLACK token
- This progresses toward N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3) and N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4)
- After taking: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 8 tokens
- With WHITE:2 bonus, I effectively have WHITE:3 toward N10 requirement
- Board has RED:3, BLACK:3 available

This is more strategic than purchasing an expensive card. I need 2 more RED and 1 more BLACK to complete N10 requirements, or 3 more RED and 2 more BLACK for N5. Taking tokens now positions me for a noble visit soon.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: I need to correct my previous invalid action. I attempted to take 1 token each of WHITE, RED, and BLACK, but the rules require taking exactly 3 tokens of 3 DIFFERENT colors (1 each) OR 2 tokens of the SAME color.

**Analyzing my situation:**
- Current tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 5 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Reserved cards: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3)
- Board has tokens: BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:3, BLACK:3 (WHITE:0)

**My strategy:** I need to collect tokens to purchase my reserved cards. I should take tokens that help with multiple cards:
- GREEN helps purchase L1_7 (needs 3 GREEN)
- BLUE helps purchase L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE) and L1_28 (needs 3 BLUE)
- BLACK helps with nobles N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4) and N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS - GREEN, BLUE, BLACK**
- Take 1 GREEN, 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK (3 different colors, 1 each)
- This is legal and efficient
- After taking: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 9 tokens
- Progress: L1_7 (1/3 GREEN), L1_8 (2/4 BLUE), L1_28 (1/3 BLUE)
- I still have 1 token slot available for future turns
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.
Reasoning: **Analyzing my situation:**
- My tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 6 tokens total
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2 (from purchased cards L1_21, L1_17, L1_13, L1_11)
- My score: 0, Opponent score: 4
- Nobles available: N4 (GREEN:4, BLUE:4), N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3), N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4)

**Strategic analysis:**
- I have WHITE:3 which qualifies me for N10 noble (needs WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)
- I need RED:3 and BLACK:3 for N10, plus GREEN:4 and BLUE:2 more for N4
- My bonuses give me discount: WHITE cost reduced by 2, BLUE cost reduced by 2

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS**
- Take 2 GREEN and 1 BLUE tokens
- This gets me closer to N4 requirement (GREEN:4, BLUE:4)
- After taking: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 9 tokens (perfect, no return needed)
- With bonuses of WHITE:2, BLUE:2, I'm building toward nobles strategically
- Board has GREEN:4 and BLUE:3 available - both colors abundant

This is more efficient than purchasing since I can take colors I need, rather than relying on what's available on the board. I'll continue building toward N4 and N10 nobles.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.. Skipping turn.

Reasoning: Current tokens: WHITE:1 RED:1 GOLD:1 (3/10), bonuses WHITE:3 RED:2 BLACK:1, score:4, reserved L2_45 (eff WHITE:5-3=2). Perfect opportunity to purchase L2_45: spend WHITE:1 + GOLD:1-as-WHITE exactly. After: tokens RED:1 (1/10), score:6, bonuses WHITE:3 RED:2 BLACK:2. N10 progress: W3/3 R2/3 Bl2/3 (need only 1 RED, which we have leftover). Excellent noble setup, +2 points surge to lead 6-0 (opponent score 0). Reveals new L2 card. Other face-ups: L1_16 (eff RED:4-2=2, pay RED:1 GOLD:1 for 1pt BLUE bonus undesired, score5 but no BLACK progress); L1_3 eff BLUE:2 (no BLUE); others unaffordable. No need to take tokens (board WHITE:0, but BLUE/GREEN/RED avail for 3 diff to 6/10, delays 2pt + key BLACK bonus). Opponent can buy reserved L1_8 (eff BLUE:4-2=2, pay BLUE:1 GOLD:1 for 1pt BLACK bonus to score1 W2 B2 Bl1), but we maintain massive lead (6-1), N10 edge (they W2 R0 Bl1 post-buy). Post-buy low tokens allow safe next take (e.g., GREEN1 BLACK1 BLUE1 or 2 BLACK if avail). Prioritizes points, noble completion, engine build over anything else. Secures L2_45 before risks.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current situation analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (10 tokens total)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Purchased: L1_21 (WHITE), L1_17 (WHITE), L1_13 (BLUE), L1_11 (BLUE)
- Reserved: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3)
- My score: 0, Opponent score: 6
- I have 3 reserved cards but cannot afford any of them

**Purchasing options I cannot afford:**
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt, costs RED:4): need 4 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): need 1 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3): need 3 BLACK, have 1 → CANNOT AFFORD
- All Level 2+ cards are too expensive

**Strategic considerations:**
- I need to work toward purchasing something productive
- L1_16 is attractive: 1 prestige point, BLUE bonus, costs RED:4
- With my BLUE:2 bonus, I need 4 RED total (not 2) - but this card gives another BLUE which helps toward nobles
- The RED tokens are the limiting factor for L1_16

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (WHITE, RED, BLACK)**
- I'll take 1 WHITE, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 11 tokens
- I'll return 1 RED token to stay at 10 tokens
- Final: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. **RED tokens for L1_16**: I need 4 RED for L1_16, so every RED token helps. This gives me 1 more RED token toward that goal.
2. **WHITE and BLACK for nobles**: These tokens work toward N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3) - I'm now closer to this noble.
3. **Board availability**: WHITE:1, RED:4, BLACK:4 are all available on the board.
4. **Preserving reserved cards**: I keep my 3 reserved cards for future purchase when I accumulate more tokens.
5. **Avoiding waste**: Taking tokens while at 10 is more strategic than purchasing an unaffordable card or reserving without clear need.

After this turn, I'll have 10 tokens and be in position to continue building toward either L1_16 (needs 3 more RED) or the N10 noble.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current tokens: RED:1 (1/10), bonuses W:3 R:2 Bl:2, score:6, no reserved. N10 progress: W3/3 R2/3 Bl2/3 (need 1 RED bonus and 1 BLACK bonus to claim 3pt noble). No face-up purchases possible (L1_3 eff BLUE:2>0; L1_15 eff Bl:1 but Bl:0; L1_16 eff R:2>1; L1_24 G:4; L2_41 eff B:2 G:2; L2_44 G:5 R:1 (G:0); etc.). Opponent score:0 (W:4 B:1 Bl:2 Go:1 total8/10, bonuses W:2 B:2), likely buys reserved L1_8 (eff BLUE:2 pay B:1 Go:1, gain 1pt BLACK bonus to score:1 W:2 B:2 Bl:1, left W:4 Bl:2 total6/10), still lags heavily (no nobles, low points). Board: W:0 B:3 G:4 R:3 Bl:2 Go:4. Optimal: TAKE 3 diff BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (all avail >=1) → tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 (4/10). Sets up 2-turn plan to L2_41 (BLACK 1pt bonus eff B:2 G:2 W:0): next turn TAKE BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (board post-this: B:2 G:3 Bl:1 still allows) → B:2 G:2 R:1 Bl:2 (6/10), then PURCHASE L2_41 pay B:2 G:2 exact, gain 1pt + BLACK bonus (score:7, bonuses W:3 R:2 Bl:3), left R:1 Bl:2 (3/10), reveals new L2. Now W:3 R:2 Bl:3, only need 1 RED bonus card for N10 (3pt to score:10). Opponent cannot easily buy L2_41 (eff post-their-buy: W:1 G:2, have W:4 but G:0). Superior to: TAKE 2 GREEN (less versatile); reserve L2_41 (delays 1 turn, unnecessary as safe); blind reserve (risky draw); target L1_16 (1pt BLUE bonus undesired vs BLACK+1pt); L1_3 (0pt BLACK but BLUE:2 pay less efficient). Efficient noble ramp (Bl3 now, R3 next), points (7+3N10=10 soon), reveal, low tokens safe. Maintains massive lead (7-1), races to 15.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens and cannot take tokens without returning some. Let me analyze my options:

**Purchasing options:**
- L1_16 (BLUE, 1 pt, cost RED:4): Need 4 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE, 0 pt, cost BLACK:3): Need 3 BLACK, have 2 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_3 (BLACK, 0 pt, cost WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): Need WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1, have 0,1,0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24 (WHITE, 1 pt, cost GREEN:4): Need 4 GREEN, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- All Level 2+ cards are too expensive

**My reserved cards are also unaffordable:**
- L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1), L1_7 (GREEN:3)

**Strategic analysis:**
- I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 6 - I MUST score points soon
- L1_16 on the board gives 1 prestige point and a BLUE bonus for only 4 RED
- With my BLUE:2 bonus, this card costs 4 RED total (no reduction)
- My current tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS to build toward L1_16**
- Take 2 RED tokens (since 2 are available on board)
- After taking: 12 tokens, so I must return 2 tokens
- I'll return 2 WHITE tokens (I have 4, which is excessive)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. **L1_16 target**: I need 4 RED for L1_16, so taking 2 RED gets me halfway there
2. **Token efficiency**: Returning WHITE tokens is strategic since I already have 2 WHITE bonuses
3. **Noble progress**: BLACK:2 and potential future RED tokens work toward N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)
4. **Opponent scoring**: With opponent at 6 points, I need to accelerate my scoring
5. **Board availability**: RED:2 available, WHITE:0 available (so I return WHITE not because of availability but because I have excess)

After this turn, I'll have 2 RED tokens and be much closer to purchasing L1_16 for 1 prestige point.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=1}, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.
Reasoning: **Analyzing my situation:**
- Current tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (10 tokens)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0, Opponent: 6
- I cannot afford any visible cards with my current tokens

**Evaluating purchases:**
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt, costs RED:4): Need 4 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): Need 1 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3): Need 3 BLACK, have 2 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt, costs GREEN:4): Need 4 GREEN, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- My reserved cards: L1_8 (BLUE:4), L1_28 (BLUE:3), L1_7 (GREEN:3) → all CANNOT AFFORD

**Strategic considerations:**
- My reserved L1_7 costs GREEN:3 - I need 3 more GREEN tokens to purchase it
- Taking 2 GREEN tokens moves me toward this goal
- GREEN tokens also help me work toward L1_24 (1 prestige point, 4 GREEN)
- My reserved L1_28 also needs 1 GREEN token

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS**
- Take 2 GREEN tokens
- After taking: GREEN:2, total tokens = 12
- Return 1 RED token to stay at 10 tokens (I have 0 RED anyway)
- Final: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. Progresses toward my reserved L1_7 (GREEN:3 requirement)
2. Also helps toward L1_24 (GREEN:4) which gives 1 prestige point
3. Preserves my BLACK:2 for potential L1_15 purchase (needs 3 BLACK)
4. Board has 3 GREEN available - safe to take 2
5. Better than reserving (no cards I need to block) or purchasing unaffordable cards
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2, RED=2}, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens and need to take tokens to work toward purchasing cards. My bonuses are WHITE:2, BLUE:2 and I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 6.

**Available tokens to take:** WHITE:0 (none available), BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

**My goals:**
- L1_8 (reserved): costs BLUE:4, gives 1 prestige + BLUE bonus → I have 1 BLUE, need 3 more
- L1_16: costs RED:4, gives 1 prestige + BLUE bonus → I have 0 RED, need 4
- L1_24: costs GREEN:4, gives 1 prestige + WHITE bonus → I have 0 GREEN, need 4
- N10 noble: requires WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3 for 3 points

**Strategic decision:**
Taking 2 RED tokens is the most efficient path toward getting my first prestige point:
1. L1_16 gives 1 prestige point + BLUE bonus
2. With my BLUE:2 bonus, I need 4 RED total for L1_16
3. Taking 2 RED now gets me halfway there
4. RED tokens also work toward N10 noble (needs RED:3)

**Token calculation:**
- Current: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens
- Take 2 RED → WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 12 tokens
- Return 2 tokens (WHITE:1, BLACK:1) → WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

This gives me RED:2 toward L1_16. After 2 more turns of taking RED tokens, I'll have RED:4 and can purchase L1_16 for my first prestige point.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=2}, tokensToReturn={RED=1, BLACK=1}]

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1). My bonuses are WHITE:2, BLUE:2 and I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 6.

**Analyzing affordable purchases:**
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 pts): costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 → with bonuses, need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 RED. I have RED:1 → CAN AFFORD!
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt): costs RED:4 → with BLUE:2 bonus, need 4 RED. I have RED:1 → cannot afford
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt): costs GREEN:4 → with WHITE:2 bonus, need 4 GREEN. I have GREEN:0 → cannot afford
- All my reserved cards are still unaffordable

**Strategic opportunity:**
- L1_3 is affordable with my current bonuses!
- I have RED:1, which covers the remaining cost after my bonuses
- This gives me a BLACK bonus, helping toward nobles N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4) and N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)
- Purchasing this card will reduce my token count from 10 to 7, freeing up space for future moves

**Best action: PURCHASE L1_3**
- Cost after bonuses: 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 RED (covered by my existing RED:1)
- After purchase: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 7 tokens
- My bonuses become: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:1
- This is more efficient than taking tokens (I'm already at 10) or reserving

I need to prioritize point-scoring, but L1_3 is the only card I can afford right now. Once I reduce my token count, I'll be in better position to accumulate RED and GREEN for L1_16 (1 pt, RED:4) and L1_24 (1 pt, GREEN:4).
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card null not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens and need to acquire resources efficiently. Looking at the board:
- Available tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:0, GOLD:4
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- My score: 0, Opponent score: 6

**Strategic Analysis:**
- L1_24 costs GREEN:4 (with WHITE:2 bonus, I need 2 more GREEN)
- L1_16 costs RED:4 (I need 4 RED tokens)
- L1_7 (my reservation) costs GREEN:3, which would give me a BLACK bonus toward nobles N5 and N10

**Token availability constraints:**
- WHITE:0 and BLACK:0 are completely unavailable
- I can only take GREEN and RED tokens (plus 1 BLUE)

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (2 GREEN, 1 RED)**
- Taking 2 GREEN: gets me closer to L1_24 (needs 4 GREEN total)
- Taking 1 RED: starts building toward L1_16 (needs 4 RED) or N10 noble
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 11 tokens
- Wait, I need to return tokens to stay under 10
- Actually, I have 10 tokens now, so taking 3 would give me 13 - I need to return 3
- Better: take 2 GREEN and 1 RED = +3 tokens, return nothing = 13 tokens, need to return 3 tokens
- Correction: I should only take 1 token (2 GREEN + 1 RED = 3, which exceeds my capacity)

**Adjusted strategy: TAKE_TOKENS (2 GREEN, 1 RED) with 3 returns**
- Taking: 2 GREEN, 1 RED
- After taking: 13 tokens, need to return 3
- I'll return 3 WHITE tokens (currently 4, returning to 1)
- Final tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 8 tokens
- This gives me: 2 GREEN (toward L1_24), 1 RED (toward L1_16/N10), and frees up WHITE for flexibility

This move positions me to potentially purchase L1_24 if one more GREEN appears, or continue building toward L1_16 or my reserved L1_7 (GREEN:3).
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1). I need to analyze my options carefully.

**Purchasing options I can afford:**
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 pts, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): With WHITE:2 and BLUE:2 bonuses, I need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 RED - I have RED:0, so CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, 0 pts, costs BLACK:3): With BLUE:2 bonus, I need 3 BLACK - I have BLACK:2, CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt, costs RED:4): With BLUE:2 bonus, I need 4 RED - I have RED:0, CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt, costs GREEN:4): With WHITE:2 bonus, I need 4 GREEN - I have GREEN:0, CANNOT AFFORD
- All Level 2+ cards are too expensive

**My reserved cards:**
- L1_8 (BLUE:4) - cannot afford
- L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) - cannot afford
- L1_7 (GREEN:3) - cannot afford

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I'm at 0 prestige points vs opponent's 6 - I need to score points
- L1_16 requires 4 RED for 1 prestige point - this is my top target
- L1_7 requires 3 GREEN - this helps toward nobles
- L1_24 requires 4 GREEN for 1 prestige point - also attractive
- Board has BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:3 available - WHITE and BLACK are depleted

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (GREEN, RED, BLUE)**
- Taking 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLUE gives me tokens toward L1_16 and L1_7
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 13 tokens
- I need to return 3 tokens: I'll return 2 WHITE, 1 GOLD (least useful for current goals)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 = 10 tokens
- This progresses toward L1_16 (need 3 more RED) and L1_7 (need 2 more GREEN)

Taking tokens is my only viable option since I cannot afford any visible or reserved cards. This sets me up for future turns where I can continue building toward point-scoring cards.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={RED=1}]

Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current tokens: BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 (7/10), bonuses W:3 R:2 Bl:2, score:6, no reserved. N10 progress: W3/3 R2/3 Bl2/3 (need 1R + 1Bl bonus for 3pt). Board: W0 B0 G1 R3 Bl0 Go4 (cannot take tokens: only G/R avail, G1<4/2same invalid, cannot 3 diff). Executing plan: PURCHASE L2_41 (eff W3 B2 G2 → pay B2 G2 exact with tokens B2 G2, gain 1pt + BLACK bonus → score:7 bonuses W3 R2 Bl3, left RED:1 BLACK:2 (3/10)). Reveals new L2. Now N10 needs only 1 RED bonus card (to score:10 total). Superior alternatives: L1_3 (eff B2 pay B2, 0pt Bl bonus, score6 Bl3 but no points); L1_15 (eff Bl1 pay Bl1, 0pt Blue undesired); others unaffordable/short. No reserve needed (buyable now, safe on board). Opponent (score0 W2 B2, tokens10/10 W4 B2 G1 R0 Bl2 Go1, reserved L1_8 etc.) likely buys L1_8 (eff B2 pay B2, +1pt Bl to score1 W2 B2 Bl1), but lags far (1 vs our7, no noble progress). Post-buy low tokens3/10 safe for next take/reveal toward RED bonus/N10. Efficient: points ramp (7+3N10=10 soon), noble near-complete (Bl3), races to15, crushes opponent.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) and cannot afford any visible or reserved card. Let me analyze my purchasing potential:

**What I need for key cards (with bonuses):**
- L1_16 (1 pt, RED:4): Need 4 RED with BLUE:2 bonus
- L1_24 (1 pt, GREEN:4): Need 4 GREEN with WHITE:2 bonus
- L1_7 (0 pt, GREEN:3): Need 3 GREEN for BLACK bonus
- L1_28 (0 pt): Need 1 GREEN with WHITE:2, BLUE:2 bonuses

**Token availability:**
- Available: BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, GOLD:4 (WHITE:0, BLACK:0 depleted)

**Strategic choice:**
I need to prioritize GREEN and RED tokens as they're the bottleneck for my point-scoring goals. I'll take 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLUE (which helps toward L1_8's BLUE:4 requirement).

**Token calculation:**
- Current: 10 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens (GREEN, RED, BLUE) = 13 tokens
- Need to return: 3 tokens
- I'll return 3 WHITE tokens (least useful for current goals)
- Final: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 9 tokens

**Progress toward goals:**
- L1_16: 1/4 RED (need 3 more)
- L1_24/L1_7: 1/3-4 GREEN (need 2-3 more)
- L1_8: 3/4 BLUE (need 1 more)

This keeps me on track for scoring my first prestige point.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens and just made an illegal move trying to take 3 tokens. Let me reassess.

**Current situation:**
- My tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (10 tokens)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0, Opponent: 7
- Board tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:0, GOLD:4

**Purchasing options I can afford:**
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 prestige point, costs RED:4)
  - With BLUE:2 bonus, I need 4 RED total
  - Board shows RED:3 available - I can afford this!
  - This gives me a BLUE bonus and 1 prestige point - exactly what I need
  
**Strategic Analysis:**
- I'm at 0 points vs opponent's 7 - I MUST score points now
- L1_16 gives me 1 prestige point and another BLUE bonus
- The BLUE bonus helps toward noble N4 (GREEN:4, BLUE:4)
- After purchase: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 = 10 tokens
- This uses all my RED and GOLD tokens productively
- Taking tokens at 10 tokens would waste my turn and return tokens

**Best action: PURCHASE L1_16**
- This is the only affordable point-scoring card on the board
- My bonuses make this affordable
- This propels me from 0 to 1 prestige point
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_16]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_16
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) and need to determine my legal action.

**Purchasing Analysis:**
- L1_3: costs RED:1 with bonuses, have RED:0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15: costs BLACK:3 with bonuses, have BLACK:2 → CANNOT AFFORD  
- L1_16: costs RED:4 with bonuses, have RED:0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24: costs GREEN:4 with bonuses, have GREEN:1 → CANNOT AFFORD
- My reserved cards (L1_8, L1_28, L1_7) are all unaffordable

**Token Taking Analysis:**
Board availability: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:0, GOLD:4
- I cannot take WHITE (0 available) or BLACK (0 available)
- Available options: GREEN, BLUE, RED, GOLD

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (GREEN, RED, BLUE)**
- Take 1 GREEN (progress toward L1_7 needing 3 GREEN)
- Take 1 RED (progress toward L1_16 needing 4 RED)
- Take 1 BLUE (for future purchases and nobles)
- After taking: 13 tokens, need to return 3 tokens
- Return 2 WHITE tokens (least useful for current goals, plenty remaining)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

This sets me up for future turns where I can continue building toward point-scoring cards.

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) and cannot purchase any visible or reserved cards. Let me analyze:

**Purchasing options I cannot afford:**
- L1_16 (1 pt, needs RED:4): I have 0 RED
- L1_24 (1 pt, needs GREEN:4): I have 0 GREEN
- L1_7 (reserved, needs GREEN:3): I have 0 GREEN
- L1_8 (reserved, needs BLUE:4): I have 1 BLUE
- L1_28 (reserved, needs BLUE:3, GREEN:1): I have 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN

**Available nobles:**
- N10 requires WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3 - I have WHITE:4, RED:0, BLACK:2
- N5 requires BLACK:4, RED:4 - I have BLACK:2, RED:0
- N4 requires GREEN:4, BLUE:4 - I have GREEN:0, BLUE:2

**Board tokens available:** WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

Since WHITE has 0 tokens, I cannot take WHITE. My best option is to take RED (1), GREEN (1), and BLUE (1) - three different colors.

**Taking 3 tokens:**
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 13 tokens
- Need to return 3 tokens to stay at 10
- Return strategy: 2 WHITE (least useful - I have plenty), 1 BLACK (preserving RED for L1_16 target)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1

This progresses toward L1_16 (need 3 more RED), L1_7 (need 2 more GREEN), and L1_24 (need 3 more GREEN). RED tokens are critical as they have limited availability (3 on board).
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=2, RED=2}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot return 2 RED tokens: player only has 1 available (including taken).
Reasoning: **Error Recovery Analysis:**
My previous action attempted to take tokens and return 3, but failed because I only had 1 RED to return. The current state shows I have 11 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:0), exceeding the 10-token limit.

**Immediate Priority:**
I MUST return 1 token to get back to 10 tokens before I can take any new actions. Taking tokens without addressing the overflow is illegal.

**Strategic Decision - RETURN 2 WHITE tokens:**
- WHITE:4 → WHITE:2 (returning 2)
- This reduces total tokens to 9, giving me flexibility for the next turn
- WHITE is my most abundant token, and with WHITE:2 bonus, I have enough for most purchases
- BLACK:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1 are all valuable for my goals

**Why NOT purchase L1_3 now:**
- With my BLACK bonus, L1_3 costs only 1 RED
- I have RED:0, so I can't afford it yet
- I need to first take RED tokens before purchasing

**Next turn planning:**
After this return action, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2 = 9 tokens
- Then I can take 1 RED token (and maybe another color) on my next turn
- This progresses toward L1_3 (needs 1 more RED) and nobles N4/N10

**Alternative considered:** Returning other tokens would hurt my strategic position more than returning WHITE.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn={WHITE=2}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: **Current situation analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (10 total)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0, Opponent score: 9 (I'm losing badly!)
- L1_15 is available: costs BLACK:3, gives BLUE bonus

**Purchasing analysis:**
- L1_15 costs 3 BLACK, I have 2 BLACK → need 1 more BLACK
- I have 1 GOLD which can substitute for BLACK, making L1_15 affordable NOW!
- Cost calculation: 3 BLACK total - 2 BLACK in hand - 0 BLUE bonus for BLACK = 1 net BLACK needed
- But I have 1 GOLD which substitutes for any color
- So I can purchase L1_15 right now using: 2 BLACK + 1 GOLD

**Why PURCHASE L1_15 now:**
- This gives me a BLUE bonus (now 3 BLUE total), progressing toward N4 noble (needs GREEN:4, BLUE:4)
- No waste of tokens
- I score points next turn by purchasing this card
- Taking tokens would be inefficient when I can buy now

**Token calculation:**
- Current: 10 tokens
- Spend 2 BLACK + 1 GOLD = 3 tokens spent
- Final: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:0 = 7 tokens
- Perfect, under 10 tokens, no returns needed

**Strategic urgency:**
- Opponent has 9 points, I have 0 - I must score points NOW
- L1_15 is a stepping stone toward higher-value cards and nobles
- This purchase uses my existing resources efficiently
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=null]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Card null not found on board or in reserved hand.. Skipping turn.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current tokens: RED:1 BLACK:1 (3/10, post-L2_50 buy), bonuses W:3 B:1 R:2 Bl:3, score:9. N10 progress: W3/3 R2/3 Bl3/3 (need 1 RED bonus for 3pt noble to 12). Perfect RED bonus visible: L2_68 (2pt RED bonus, eff W:3-3=0 Bl:5-3=2, pay Bl:2). Have Bl:1, short 1 Bl (board Bl:1 avail). Optimal: TAKE 3 diff BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (board B:2 G:3 Bl:1 all >=1) → tokens B:1 G:1 R:2 Bl:2 (6/10). Next turn: PURCHASE L2_68 pay Bl:2 exact → +2pt RED bonus (R:3) → claim N10 +3pt (total +5pt to score:14), left B:1 G:1 R:2 (4/10), reveals new L2. Races to 15 (one more pt card/noble). Opponent (10/10 W4 B2 G1 R0 Bl2 Go1 score:0 W2 B2) likely buys reserved L1_8 (eff B:4-2=2 pay B:2 exact → +1pt Bl bonus to score:1 W2 B2 Bl1, left 8/10), cannot buy L2_68 (eff W1 Bl5, Bl2<5). Post-our-take board Bl:0, they cannot take Bl. No threats. Superior to: buy L1_15 free (0pt BLUE minor, wastes turn/reveal low L1); take 2 GOLD (versatile but delays specific Bl); reserve L2_68 (risks opponent, unnecessary); other takes (e.g., B1 R1 Bl1 less versatile). Efficient points/noble ramp (14 soon), reveal, crushes opponent (14-1), prevents catch-up.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Analyzing my situation:**
- My tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (9 tokens total)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0, Opponent score: 9
- I need to score points urgently

**Purchasing options I can afford:**
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, 0 pts, costs BLACK:3): With BLUE:2 bonus, I need 3 BLACK - I have BLACK:2, CANNOT afford
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 pts, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): With WHITE:2 and BLUE:2 bonuses, I need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 RED - I have RED:0, CANNOT afford
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt, costs RED:4): Need 4 RED - I have 0, CANNOT afford
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt, costs GREEN:4): Need 4 GREEN - I have 0, CANNOT afford
- All Level 2+ cards are too expensive

**My reserved cards:**
- L1_8 (BLUE:4) - need 4 BLUE, have 2, CANNOT afford
- L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1) - need 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN, CANNOT afford
- L1_7 (GREEN:3) - need 3 GREEN, have 0, CANNOT afford

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I'm at 0 prestige points vs opponent's 9 - I need to score points
- L1_16 is the best scoring option: 1 prestige point, BLUE bonus, costs RED:4
- L1_24 is also attractive: 1 prestige point, WHITE bonus, costs GREEN:4
- Board has GREEN:2, RED:3, BLUE:1 available - WHITE and BLACK are depleted
- With 9 tokens, I can take up to 1 more token without returning

**Taking tokens efficiently:**
- Take 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLUE
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 12 tokens
- Need to return 2 tokens: I'll return 2 WHITE (least useful for current goals)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. **GREEN for L1_7 and nobles**: 1 GREEN moves me toward L1_7 (needs 3 more) and N4 (needs GREEN:4)
2. **RED for L1_16**: 1 RED moves me toward L1_16 (needs 3 more) - my top scoring priority
3. **BLUE for flexibility**: 1 BLUE helps toward L1_8 reservation (needs 2 more) and N4 noble (needs BLUE:4)
4. **Noble progression**: With WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, I'm building toward N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3)

Taking tokens is my only viable option since I cannot afford any visible or reserved cards. This sets me up for future turns to continue building toward point-scoring cards.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: I'm at 8 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1), so I can take up to 2 more tokens without returning. 

**Purchasing options:**
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 pts): costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 → with bonuses need 1 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, 0 pts): costs BLACK:3 → with BLUE:2 bonus need 3 BLACK, have 2 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt): costs RED:4 → with BLUE:2 bonus need 4 RED, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt): costs GREEN:4 → with WHITE:2 bonus need 4 GREEN, have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- All Level 2+ cards are too expensive

**My reserved cards:**
- L1_8 (BLUE:4, 1 pt): cannot afford
- L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1): cannot afford  
- L1_7 (GREEN:3): cannot afford

**Strategic analysis:**
- I'm at 0 prestige points vs opponent's 9 - I need to score points urgently
- L1_16 is my top target: 1 prestige point + BLUE bonus, costs 4 RED
- Board availability: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:0
- I cannot take WHITE or BLACK (both 0), so I must take the 3 colors that ARE available
- Taking RED, GREEN, and BLUE gives me tokens for L1_16 (RED), L1_7 (GREEN), and L1_28 (BLUE)

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (GREEN, RED, BLUE)**
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 11 tokens
- This progresses toward L1_16 (need 3 more RED), L1_7 (need 2 more GREEN), and L1_28 (need 2 more BLUE)
- I'll need to return 1 token next turn since 11 > 10
- This is my only viable option since I cannot afford any visible or reserved cards
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens and need to acquire resources strategically. My previous attempt failed because I tried to take 3 tokens while already at 10 without proper returns.

**Current Status:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0 vs Opponent's 9 (I'm behind!)

**Card Analysis:**
- L1_24: costs GREEN:4, gives WHITE bonus + 1 prestige point
- L1_7: costs GREEN:3, gives BLACK bonus
- L1_16: costs RED:4, gives BLUE bonus + 1 prestige point

**Strategy:**
1. I need GREEN tokens for L1_24 (1 prestige) and L1_7
2. Board has GREEN:2 available - I'll take 2 GREEN
3. I need RED tokens for L1_16 - I'll take 1 RED
4. This gives me: GREEN:3 (1+2), RED:1 (0+1) - perfect for L1_7!
5. After taking: 13 tokens total → Return 1 RED to stay at 10

**After Action:** GREEN:3, RED:1, which positions me to afford L1_7 (GREEN:3) on my next turn for a BLACK bonus.

This is more efficient than returning tokens just to take different colors. I maximize my GREEN accumulation for point-scoring cards.

======================================================================================

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=1, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1) and need to take tokens to work toward affordable cards.

**Purchasing options I can afford:**
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): With WHITE:2, BLUE:2 bonuses, I need 1 RED - I have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3): With BLUE:2 bonus, I need 3 BLACK - I have 2 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt, costs RED:4): With BLUE:2 bonus, I need 4 RED - I have 0 → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt, costs GREEN:4): With WHITE:2 bonus, I need 4 GREEN - I have 1 → CANNOT AFFORD
- All reserved cards are too expensive

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I have 0 prestige points vs opponent's 14 - I need to score points quickly
- L1_16 (1 prestige point, needs RED:4) and L1_24 (1 prestige point, needs GREEN:4) are my best targets
- L1_7 (reserved, needs GREEN:3) would help with nobles N4 (GREEN:4, BLUE:4) and N5 (BLACK:4, RED:4)

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (RED, GREEN, BLUE)**
- Taking 1 RED, 1 GREEN, 1 BLUE progresses toward L1_16 (needs 4 RED) and L1_24 (needs 4 GREEN)
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 13 tokens
- I must return 3 tokens: I'll return 2 WHITE, leaving me with WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens
- This keeps me at 10 tokens while making strategic progress toward point-scoring cards

Board availability: GREEN:2, RED:3, BLUE:1 are all available. WHITE is depleted so returning WHITE tokens is optimal.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=2}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 2
Reasoning: **Critical situation analysis:**
- I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1)
- My bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2
- Score: 0, Opponent score: 14 (one point away from winning!)
- I need to make moves that maximize my prestige point potential

**Purchasing options I cannot afford:**
- L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 pt, costs RED:4): With BLUE:2 bonus, need 4 RED - I have 0 RED → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 pt, costs GREEN:4): With WHITE:2 bonus, need 4 GREEN - I have 1 GREEN → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, 0 pts, costs BLACK:3): With BLUE:2 bonus, need 3 BLACK - I have 2 BLACK → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 pts, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1): With WHITE:2, BLUE:2 bonuses, need 1 RED - I have 0 RED → CANNOT AFFORD

**My reserved cards:**
- L1_8 (BLUE:4, 1 pt): need 4 BLUE - I have 2 BLUE → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_28 (WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1): With WHITE:2 bonus, need 0 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN - I have 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN → CANNOT AFFORD
- L1_7 (GREEN:3): need 3 GREEN - I have 1 GREEN → CANNOT AFFORD

**Board availability:** GREEN:2, RED:3, BLUE:1 available

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (GREEN, RED, BLUE)**
- Take 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLUE
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 13 tokens
- Need to return 3 tokens: I'll return 2 WHITE, 1 BLACK (least useful for current goals)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. **GREEN tokens**: Getting closer to L1_24 (1 pt) and L1_7 (3 GREEN)
2. **RED tokens**: Progressing toward L1_16 (4 RED for 1 pt)
3. **BLUE tokens**: Working toward L1_8 reservation (4 BLUE for 1 pt) and L1_28 (3 BLUE)
4. **Strategic efficiency**: These tokens directly support my point-scoring goals

After this turn, I'll have tokens positioned to purchase L1_3 once I get 1 more RED, and continue building toward prestige-scoring cards.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={BLACK=1}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 1
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:1). My strategy is to take 3 tokens while returning 3 to stay at 10 tokens.

**Strategic Analysis:**
- My priority is accumulating GREEN tokens for high-value point cards like L2_64 (3 pts, costs GREEN:6) and L2_59 (1 pt, costs GREEN:2, RED:3, WHITE:3)
- Currently I have 1 GREEN, need 5 more for L2_64
- L2_41 costs WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2 - with bonuses I need WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:2
- Board has GREEN:2, RED:3, BLUE:1 available - perfect for taking 3 different colors

**Best action: TAKE_TOKENS (GREEN, RED, BLUE)**
- Take 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLUE
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 13 tokens
- Return 2 WHITE and 1 GOLD (least useful for my GREEN-focused strategy)
- Final: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 = 10 tokens

**Why this is optimal:**
1. GREEN tokens directly toward L2_64 (3 prestige points) and L2_59 (1 prestige point)
2. RED tokens work toward L2_59 and L1_16 (1 pt, costs RED:4)
3. BLUE tokens give me flexibility for future purchases
4. Returning WHITE and GOLD preserves color tokens I can use more strategically

This sets me up with 2 GREEN tokens and positions me to continue building toward prestige-scoring cards.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=2}]

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current tokens: BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:0 (3/10? wait 4 total), bonuses W:3 B:1 R:3 Bl:3, score:14. N10 already claimed (visited). Goal: reach 15 prestige immediately. Perfect 1pt card available: L1_16 (1pt BLUE bonus, cost RED:4 → eff R:4-3=1, pay R:1 exact with tokens R:1) → gain +1pt (score:15), BLUE bonus (B:2 minor), left B:1 G:1 (2/10), reveals new L1. Wins game instantly. Superior to: free L1_15 (0pt BLUE, no points/win); L1_3 (pay B:1 for 0pt BLACK minor); takes/reserves (delays win, unnecessary with opponent at 0pts, 10tokens likely buys reserved L1_8 for +1pt to score1, but irrelevant post-our15). No other 1+pt affordable (L1_24 G4>1; L2s short G/etc.; L3s too expensive). Efficient: immediate victory (15pts), reveal bonus, crushes opponent (15-1), prevents any comeback as game ends on 15.
