Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: I will start by collecting RED, WHITE, and BLACK tokens. These colors are versatile for the visible Level 1 cards, specifically targeting L1_36 (RED/BLACK/WHITE) or building towards L1_16, which provides an early prestige point for 4 RED tokens. There are at least 4 of each color available on the board, so this action is valid and keeps my options open for a strong engine start.

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Turn 1. I have 0 tokens. Player 0 took WHITE, RED, BLACK. I'll take 3 different colored tokens: BLUE, GREEN, RED. This positions me well for Noble N9 (requires 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses), which Player 0 isn't targeting efficiently. These colors are also versatile for purchasing various Level 1 and 2 cards. Board has sufficient tokens: BLUE=4, GREEN=4, RED=3. Taking 1 of each equals 3 tokens total (under the 10 limit). No returns needed.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am targeting card L1_34 which provides a RED bonus. It costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK. Currently, I have 1 WHITE, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN token this turn, I will have exactly the resources required (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK) to purchase L1_34 on my next turn, considering my current total of 6 tokens is well within the limit of 10.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: Turn 2. Continuing my Noble N9 strategy (3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). Currently have BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1 (3 tokens). I'm targeting L1_18 (WHITE bonus, costs 1B 2G 1R 1K) as my first card because it's affordable next turn and its WHITE bonus reduces costs of RED-bonus cards L1_34 and L1_36, which I need for N9. By taking GREEN=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1 this turn, I'll have BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1 (6 tokens) - exactly what's needed to purchase L1_18 next turn. Board has sufficient tokens: GREEN=2, BLACK=3, WHITE=2 available. Taking 3 different colors is valid. Total tokens after taking: 3+3=6 (under 10 limit, no returns needed). This path is faster than reserving L1_16, and opponent is unlikely to block L1_18 before I can buy it.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have collected the necessary tokens to purchase card L1_34, which costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK. Since I currently possess 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK tokens, I can afford this purchase exactly. Acquiring L1_34 provides a RED bonus, which will build my engine and make it easier to acquire other cards, specifically the prestige-point card L1_16 that requires 4 RED. Starting the engine early is more efficient than hoarding tokens for higher-tier cards at this stage.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 3. Perfect timing - I can now purchase L1_18, which was my target from Turn 2. I have exactly the required tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 matching L1_18's cost of 1B+2G+1R+1K. This purchase is critical for my Noble N9 strategy (needs 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). The WHITE bonus from L1_18 will reduce future costs - specifically, it makes L1_36 (RED bonus, costs 1W+1R+3K) cheaper by eliminating the WHITE cost. After this purchase, I'll retain my 1 WHITE token and gain my first bonus, while the opponent only has 1 RED bonus. I'm on track for an efficient Noble N9 path. Board shows L1_18 is available. This is far better than taking more tokens when I can make strategic progress now.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {RED=2}
Reasoning: My current goal is to build upon my RED engine and secure prestige points. I have one RED bonus. I am targeting card L1_16, which costs 4 RED and provides 1 prestige point. With my bonus, I only need 3 RED tokens; since I already have 1 RED token, I need 2 more. Additionally, I am eyeing L1_36, which provides another RED bonus for 1 WHITE, 1 RED, and 3 BLACK. By taking RED, BLACK, and WHITE tokens this turn, I move closer to both objectives. This maintains flexibility and keeps my token count well below the limit of 10.

======================================================================================

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2}
Reasoning: I'm building toward Noble N9 (3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). My WHITE bonus from L1_18 reduces costs. L1_39 (RED bonus) costs 3W normally, but only 2W with my bonus. I currently have 1W and need 1 more. By taking WHITE+BLUE+GREEN this turn, I'll have 2W+1B+1G (4 tokens total). Next turn I can purchase L1_39 for 2W, gaining my first RED bonus toward N9 while retaining 1B+1G for future flexibility. I chose BLUE and GREEN as the other colors because they're essential for N9 requirements and will help with future BLUE/GREEN bonus card purchases. The opponent has 1W and can't take 2 WHITE next turn (only 2 available on board, need 4+ for same-color double take), so L1_39 is unlikely to be blocked. Board has sufficient tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=4, GREEN=4. This is more flexible than reserving L1_39.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am currently one RED token away from purchasing card L1_16, which provides 1 prestige point. Additionally, I am looking to expand my engine with either card L1_36 (RED bonus) or L1_39 (RED bonus). By taking WHITE, RED, and BLACK tokens, I will have the 3 RED tokens required (plus my 1 RED bonus) to buy L1_16 next turn. This combination also puts me one BLACK token away from L1_36 and one WHITE token away from L1_39, providing excellent flexible paths for engine development while securing immediate points.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: Turn 5: Following my Noble N9 strategy (requires 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses for 3 prestige points). Last turn I took WHITE+BLUE+GREEN tokens to reach 2W+1B+1G (4 tokens total). Now I can purchase L1_39, which I've been targeting. L1_39 costs 3W normally, but with my WHITE bonus (from L1_18) the effective cost is 3W-1W=2W. I have exactly WHITE=2 tokens needed. Verified: L1_39 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. After purchase: I'll have WHITE=1 bonus + RED=1 bonus (first RED for N9), retaining BLUE=1 + GREEN=1 tokens. Token count after: 2 total (well under 10 limit). The opponent has 0 WHITE tokens and cannot block this. Though L1_39 gives 0 points, it's essential for my N9 path which grants 3 points when complete. This is turn 5 (early game) so building toward a Noble is efficient. The opponent only has 1 RED bonus and isn't targeting N9 effectively. Next focus: acquire BLUE and GREEN bonuses.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 3 RED tokens and 1 RED bonus, which is enough to purchase card L1_16. This card provides my first prestige point and a BLUE bonus. Completing this purchase is efficient as it uses the tokens I specifically gathered for this purpose and begins my score progression while freeing up space in my token inventory (reducing from 7 tokens to 4).

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: Turn 6: Pursuing Noble N9 (3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). I have WHITE=1, RED=1 bonuses. L1_33 (RED bonus) is most accessible - costs 1B+1G+1K with my WHITE bonus. I have B=1, G=1, just need BLACK=1. Taking RED, BLACK, WHITE gives me W=1, B=1, G=1, R=1, K=1 (5 tokens). Next turn I buy L1_33 with B+G+K, gaining my second RED bonus. Key insight: With RED=2 bonuses, L1_10 (BLUE bonus) becomes cheaper. L1_10 base cost 1W+1G+2R+1K becomes just 1G+1K with WHITE=1, RED=2 bonuses - saving 1 RED token vs buying it with only RED=1 bonus. Board has RED=4, BLACK=2, WHITE=2 available. Token count: 2+3=5 (under 10, no returns). This efficiently sets up both my second RED bonus and future BLUE bonus acquisition for N9.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am targeting cards L1_36 and L1_33, both of which provide a RED bonus to further build my engine. Currently, I have 2 WHITE and 2 BLACK tokens. To purchase L1_36, I require 1 RED and 1 additional BLACK token. To purchase L1_33, I need 1 GREEN token (since my BLUE bonus covers the BLUE cost). By taking 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK token from the board, I will be in a position to purchase either of these cards on my next turn, and my total token count will only be 7, well within the limit of 10. Taking the last available BLACK token also limits the options for my opponent.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 7: Executing my Turn 6 plan perfectly. I have exactly the tokens needed to purchase L1_33. Base cost 1W+1B+1G+1K becomes 0W+1B+1G+1K with my WHITE=1 bonus, and I pay with BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 tokens. This gives me RED=2 bonus (second RED toward Noble N9 which needs 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED). After purchase I'll have WHITE=1, RED=1 tokens remaining and WHITE=1, RED=2 bonuses. Key strategic advantage: With RED=2 bonuses, L1_10 (BLUE bonus, needed for N9) becomes extremely cheap - its base cost 1W+1G+2R+1K reduces to just 1G+1K with my WHITE=1, RED=2 bonuses. I can purchase L1_10 next turn after taking just GREEN+BLACK tokens. L1_33 verified on board. This efficiently builds my N9 engine.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have the necessary tokens and bonuses to purchase card L1_36, which provides a second RED bonus. The cost is 1 WHITE, 1 RED, and 3 BLACK. With my current RED bonus, the token cost is reduced to 1 WHITE and 3 BLACK. I currently possess 2 WHITE and 3 BLACK tokens, so I can afford this purchase while keeping one WHITE token for future flexibility. Building a second RED bonus is strategic because it continues my engine development, utilizes the large amount of BLACK tokens I acquired, and denies my opponent (who already has two RED bonuses) a cheap RED-producing card.

Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=3}
Reasoning: Turn 8: Critical opportunity to advance Noble N9 strategy (requires 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). Currently have WHITE=1, RED=2 bonuses; still need 3 GREEN, 3 BLUE, 1 more RED. L1_31 (GREEN bonus, 0 points) has base cost 3R, but with my RED=2 bonuses effective cost is only 1R (3R-2R=1R). I have RED=1 token, so I can purchase immediately. VERIFIED: L1_31 exists in board's LEVEL_1 face-up cards. This is superior to taking tokens because: (1) I secure my first GREEN bonus toward N9 (1/3 GREEN requirement complete), (2) Opponent has RED=2 bonuses and RED=1 token - could also afford L1_31 next turn, so I must buy it first, (3) GREEN bonus will help reduce future card costs. After purchase: tokens WHITE=1, RED=0 (total 1 token, down from current 2), bonuses WHITE=1, RED=2, GREEN=1. Next I'll collect GREEN+BLACK tokens to purchase L1_10 (BLUE bonus, effective cost 1G+1K with my bonuses). This is concrete progress toward N9 vs speculative token collection.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3}
Reasoning: I am targeting card L1_27, which provides a GREEN bonus. The cost of this card is 1 BLUE, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK. Given my current bonuses (1 BLUE and 2 RED), the effective cost is reduced to just 2 BLACK tokens. There are currently 4 BLACK tokens available on the board, so I can take 2 to prepare for this purchase. This is a highly efficient way to expand my engine, and it keeps my total token count at 5, well below the limit of 10.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 9: Pursuing Noble N9 (3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). Currently have WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2 bonuses; need 3 BLUE, 2 more GREEN, 1 more RED. L1_10 (BLUE bonus, 0 points) is critical - its base cost 1W+1G+2R+1K reduces to just 1K with my bonuses. VERIFIED: L1_10 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. I have W=1 token; need just 1 BLACK to purchase L1_10 next turn. Taking BLUE+GREEN+BLACK gives me K=1 (for L1_10), plus B=1 and G=1 useful for future GREEN bonus cards (L1_30 needs 2B effective, L1_27 needs 1B+2K effective). Opponent likely buys L1_27 this turn (costs 2K effective for them, they have K=2), so L1_10 should remain available. Board has B=4, G=3, K=2 available. Token count: current 1 + taking 3 = 4 total (well under 10, no returns needed). This is faster than reserving L1_10 and enables immediate purchase next turn.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have the necessary tokens and bonuses to purchase card L1_27, which provides a GREEN bonus. The cost of this card is 1 BLUE, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK. Given my current bonuses of 1 BLUE and 2 RED, the effective cost is reduced to just 2 BLACK tokens. I currently possess exactly 2 BLACK tokens, making this an efficient purchase that expands my engine without depleting my other token reserves (WHITE, GREEN, and RED). Expanding into GREEN bonuses is a strategic move to work towards the requirements of Nobles N7 and N9.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 10: Executing my planned purchase of L1_10 (BLUE bonus). As stated in Turn 9, I collected BLUE+GREEN+BLACK tokens specifically to buy L1_10 this turn. VERIFIED: L1_10 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. Base cost 1W+1G+2R+1K reduces to just 1K with my bonuses (WHITE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2). I have exactly BLACK=1 token needed. This is critical because: (1) I secure my first BLUE bonus toward Noble N9 (1/3 BLUE requirement complete), (2) Opponent now has BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2 bonuses - they're also pursuing N9 and could target remaining BLUE bonus cards, (3) No other easily accessible BLUE bonus cards visible (L2_52 costs 6B - not feasible). After purchase: tokens W=1, B=1, G=1, K=0 (3 total, well under 10), bonuses W=1, G=1, R=2, BLUE=1. Progress toward N9: BLUE 1/3, GREEN 1/3, RED 2/3. Alternative L1_38 (completing RED 3/3) less urgent - can acquire later with 1W token. L1_6 (BLACK bonus) would divert from N9 strategy. This maintains momentum toward N9's 3-point reward while establishing crucial BLUE foundation.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=3}
Reasoning: I am focusing on building my engine and progressing toward Nobles N7 and N9, which require GREEN, RED, BLUE, and BLACK bonuses. Currently, I have 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 2 RED bonuses. My goal is to acquire card L1_6 (BLACK bonus) and L1_30 (GREEN bonus). L1_6 costs 2 WHITE and 2 GREEN tokens; L1_30 costs 2 BLUE and 2 RED tokens. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED token, I will have a total of 2 WHITE, 2 GREEN, and 2 RED tokens. This allows me to purchase L1_6 on my next turn (using the 2 WHITE and 2 GREEN) and leaves me with 2 RED tokens, putting me just one BLUE token away from buying L1_30. This is an efficient move that keeps my token count at 6, well below the 10-token limit.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2}
Reasoning: Critical decision between L1_38 (RED bonus) and L1_30 (GREEN bonus), both affordable with my current resources. I have W=1, B=1, G=1 tokens and W=1, B=1, G=1, R=2 bonuses. Pursuing Noble N9 (requires 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED bonuses). Current progress: BLUE 1/3, GREEN 1/3, RED 2/3. L1_38 costs 2W+2R base, but with my bonuses reduces to just 1W (2-1=1 WHITE, 2-2=0 RED). I have W=1, so I can buy it. L1_30 costs 2B+2R base, reduces to 1B with my bonuses. I have B=1, so I can also buy it. CRITICAL INSIGHT: Opponent (W=2, G=2, R=2 tokens with B=1, G=1, R=2 bonuses) can ALSO afford L1_38 this turn! For them, L1_38 costs 2W after their bonuses, and they have W=2. If I don't buy L1_38 now, opponent buys it Turn 12, completing THEIR RED requirement (RED 3/3) and permanently denying me this card. No other accessible RED bonus cards exist on board. However, opponent CANNOT buy L1_30 right now because they have B=0. They'd need to collect BLUE tokens first (Turn 12), then buy L1_30 (Turn 13 earliest). This gives me time to secure L1_30 later. VERIFIED: L1_38 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. Buying L1_38 now: (1) Completes my RED=3/3 requirement for N9, (2) Denies opponent their easiest path to RED=3, (3) Forces them to find alternative RED cards or shift strategy, (4) L1_30 remains available for me to purchase after collecting BLUE token. After purchase: tokens W=0, B=1, G=1 (3 total), bonuses W=1, B=1, G=1, R=3. Turn 12 I'll collect BLUE token, Turn 13 buy L1_30 for GREEN=2/3.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=4}
Reasoning: I can currently afford card L1_6, which provides a BLACK bonus. This is a strategic move to build toward Noble N7 (requiring 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, 3 RED) and Noble N3 (requiring 4 BLACK, 4 WHITE). The card costs 2 WHITE and 2 GREEN tokens, both of which I have exactly. Purchasing this card now efficiently uses my current token stock (reducing my count from 6 to 2, giving me plenty of space for future turns) and develops my engine without needing to take additional tokens first.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3}
Reasoning: Noble N9 pursuit hitting roadblock - after L1_38 completing RED=3/3, no affordable BLUE or GREEN bonus cards remain for N9 completion. L2_52 needs 5B tokens, L2_64 needs 5G tokens. Shifting to concrete point accumulation strategy. L1_30 (GREEN bonus, 0 points) costs 2B+2R base, reduces to 1B effective with my bonuses (B=1 covers 1B, R=3 covers 2R fully). VERIFIED: L1_30 exists on board under LEVEL_1 cards. I have B=1 token available for immediate purchase. Critical reasons: (1) Opponent (B=0, G=1, R=2 tokens with B=1, G=1, R=2, K=1 bonuses) CANNOT buy L1_30 this turn - needs 2B effective cost but has 0 BLUE tokens, would need to collect BLUE tokens Turn 12 then buy Turn 13, (2) GREEN=2 total bonuses unlocks L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 point) - reduces its 4G base cost to 2G effective (4-2=2), enabling purchase in 2 turns after collecting 1 more GREEN token, (3) Prevents opponent from catching up to my GREEN bonus count, (4) GREEN=2 reduces future L2_64 cost from 5G to 4G if needed later. After purchase: tokens B=0, G=1 (1 total, well under 10), bonuses W=1, B=1, G=2, R=3. Turn 13 plan: Take GREEN+RED+BLACK tokens. Turn 14: Buy L1_24 for 2G, scoring first point and gaining WHITE=2 bonus. Concrete path to points vs blocked Noble routes.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can currently purchase card L1_21 for free because its cost (2 RED and 1 BLACK) is entirely covered by my current bonuses (2 RED and 1 BLACK). This is an extremely efficient move that expands my engine by adding a WHITE bonus without depleting my token reserves. This move strengthens my position for future purchases and contributes toward the requirements for Noble N3 (4 WHITE, 4 BLACK).

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=3}
Reasoning: CRITICAL INSIGHT: L1_5 is completely FREE to purchase! Base cost 2G+1R reduces to 0G+0R with my GREEN=2 and RED=3 bonuses. VERIFIED: L1_5 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. This is an extraordinary opportunity that I must seize immediately for several reasons: (1) FREE BLACK bonus without spending any tokens - pure value, (2) Opponent can afford L1_5 for only 1G (with their G=1 bonus, effective cost 1G from base 2G+1R) - if I don't take it now, they might buy it Turn 14, permanently denying me this free opportunity, (3) BLACK=1 bonus opens paths to N7 (currently G 2/3, K 0/3, R 3/3 - after purchase I'd be K 1/3) and N3 nobles, (4) Maintains my G=1 token for future use since cost is zero. Yes, this delays my L1_24 purchase (1 point) by one turn compared to my Turn 12 plan of taking tokens now. BUT passing on a FREE card to rush for 1 turn is terrible value. After purchase: tokens unchanged (G=1), bonuses W=1,B=1,G=2,R=3,K=1. Turn 14 plan: Take GREEN+RED+BLACK tokens (board shows all available). Turn 15: Buy L1_24 for 2G effective cost, scoring first point and gaining WHITE=2 bonus. The free bonus now compounds into future efficiency - this is mathematically optimal.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am focusing on building my engine towards the Noble requirements, specifically N7 (3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, 3 RED) and N3 (4 BLACK, 4 WHITE). Currently, I have 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED, and 1 BLACK bonus. Looking at the face-up cards, L1_2 (BLACK bonus) is very accessible; its cost is 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED. With my current bonuses, I only need 1 BLUE token to purchase it. Additionally, L1_35 (RED bonus) costs 2 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 2 BLACK, which effectively costs me 1 WHITE and 1 BLACK token after my bonuses. By taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token, I will have the necessary tokens to purchase L1_2 next turn and will be set up to pursue L1_35 or other engine-building cards immediately after. This action brings my total token count to 6, well within the limit.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Following my Turn 13 plan to accumulate tokens for L1_24 purchase. Taking GREEN+RED+BLACK gives me G=2 (needed for L1_24's 2G effective cost) plus R=1 and K=1 for future flexibility. VERIFIED: Board has G=2, R=2, K=3 available, so all three colors can be taken. Current 1 token + taking 3 = 4 total, well under the 10-token limit (no returns needed). This sets up Turn 15 purchase of L1_24 (WHITE bonus, 1 point) to tie game 1-1 and establish WHITE=2 bonus, which reduces L2_54 to just 2B effective cost for subsequent point accumulation. Alternative L1_7 (BLACK bonus, costs 1G effective, only card I can buy NOW) would delay point scoring by one turn - buying it leaves me at 0 tokens, forcing Turn 15 token collection, then Turn 16 L1_24 purchase. That's strictly worse than collecting tokens now and buying L1_24 next turn. Opponent (1 point lead, W=1,B=1,G=1,R=2,K=1 tokens with W=1,B=1,G=1,R=2,K=1 bonuses) can afford L1_35 (1W+1K effective) or L1_2 (1B effective) for bonuses but cannot buy L1_24 (3G effective vs their 1G token). L1_7 remains safe (opponent needs 2G effective vs 1G token). Prioritizing point scoring over bonus building to stay competitive in race to 15 prestige points.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_2 to increase my BLACK bonus. This move is highly efficient as the card's cost (1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED) is nearly covered by my current bonuses (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED), requiring me to spend only a single BLUE token. Strengthening my BLACK bonus is a critical strategic step toward qualifying for Noble N7 (3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, 3 RED) and Noble N3 (4 BLACK, 4 WHITE). By buying this now, I expand my engine while maintaining a healthy stock of tokens (WHITE, GREEN, RED, BLACK) to pursue L1_35 or other beneficial cards on subsequent turns.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Executing my Turn 14 plan to purchase L1_24 for my first point. VERIFIED: L1_24 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. Base cost 4G reduces to 2G effective with my GREEN=2 bonus. I have exactly G=2 tokens needed. This is the correct move because: (1) Scores my first point, tying game 1-1 with opponent, (2) Establishes WHITE=2 bonus, which reduces L2_54's cost from 2W+3B+3R base to just 2B effective (WHITE=2 covers 2W, RED=3 covers 3R fully), making L2_54 immediately accessible after collecting 2 BLUE tokens next turn, (3) Alternative L1_7 (BLACK bonus, 1G effective) delays point scoring and pursues difficult N7 path requiring expensive L2_46 (4K effective for BLACK=3), (4) Delaying by taking tokens first provides no advantage - no better cards become affordable. After purchase: tokens G=0,R=1,K=1 (2 total, well under 10), bonuses W=2,B=1,G=2,R=3,K=1, score 1. Turn 16 plan: Take 2 BLUE tokens (board has B=4, eligible for 2-of-same). Turn 17: Purchase L2_54 for 2B, scoring second point and gaining WHITE=3 bonus.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_25 because it is free given my current bonuses. Its cost is 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK, and my current bonuses are 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK. This move is highly efficient as it expands my engine by adding a GREEN bonus without spending any tokens. This brings me significantly closer to qualifying for Noble N7 (3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, 3 RED) and Noble N9 (3 GREEN, 3 BLUE, 3 RED), as I will now have 2 GREEN bonuses and already possess 2 BLACK and 2 RED bonuses.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL INSIGHT: L1_29 is completely FREE to purchase! Base cost 2W+1B reduces to 0W+0B with my WHITE=2 and BLUE=1 bonuses. VERIFIED: L1_29 exists on board under LEVEL_1 face-up cards. This triggers an extraordinary THREE-CARD CASCADE: (1) L1_29 FREE now gives GREEN=3, (2) GREEN=3 makes L1_12 (base 1B+3G+1R) completely FREE next turn - all costs covered by bonuses B=1,G=3,R=3, (3) GREEN=3 makes L1_7 (base 3G) completely FREE (3-3=0). After this cascade (Turns 16-18), I'll have bonuses W=2,B=2,G=3,R=3,K=2 - an incredibly strong engine. CRITICAL DENYING MOVE: If opponent buys L1_29 this turn, THEY unlock this cascade instead. Opponent's bonuses (W=1,B=1,G=2,R=2,K=2) mean L1_29 costs them only 1W, and would give THEM G=3, making L1_12 and L1_7 FREE for them. No other Level 1 card unlocks this cascade - buying L1_35, L1_7, or L1_12 first doesn't make subsequent cards FREE for opponent. By taking L1_29 now, I secure the cascade for myself AND permanently deny opponent this efficiency advantage. STRATEGIC TRADE-OFF: This delays L2_54 purchase from Turn 17 (original plan) to Turn 20 (3 turns later), BUT provides three FREE bonuses and positions me one BLACK away from N7 noble (G=3✓,K=2→3,R=3✓ after L1_7) worth 3 points. The superior bonuses make all future cards 2-3 tokens cheaper, saving those 3 turns back on subsequent purchases. Passing on THREE free cards to rush 3 turns is terrible value - same logic as Turn 13 L1_5. After purchase: tokens R=1,K=1 (unchanged), bonuses W=2,B=1,G=3,R=3,K=1. Turn 17: Buy L1_12 (FREE). Turn 18: Buy L1_7 (FREE). Turn 19+: Pursue either L2_54 for points or L2_46 + N7 for noble.

Its cost is 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED, while my current bonuses are 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK.

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Executing Turn 17 plan from my Turn 16 cascade strategy. L1_12 is completely FREE to purchase: base cost B=1,G=3,R=1 reduces to 0 effective cost with my bonuses (B=1 covers 1B, G=3 covers 3G, R=3 covers 1R fully). VERIFIED: L1_12 exists on board under LEVEL_1 cards. This is step 2 of my 3-card cascade after L1_29. Purchasing L1_12 gives me BLUE=2 bonus without spending any tokens, advancing toward the strong W=2,B=2,G=3,R=3,K=2 engine I planned. After purchase: tokens R=1,K=1 (unchanged), bonuses W=2,B=2,G=3,R=3,K=1. Turn 18 plan: Purchase L1_7 for FREE (cost 3G, fully covered by G=3 bonus) to complete cascade with BLACK=2 bonus. This positions me for N7 noble pursuit (G=3✓,K=2,R=3✓ - need 1 more BLACK bonus for K=3 requirement). Opponent cannot interfere since I'm buying L1_12 now. Free bonuses compound efficiency for future expensive cards like L2_46 or L2_54.

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL PIVOT from cascade strategy: L1_7's BLACK bonus doesn't compound as planned. Analysis: (1) N9 noble (G=3✓,B=3,R=3✓) achievable via L2_52 WITHOUT L1_7 - after L2_52 I'll have W=2,B=3,G=3,R=3,K=1 meeting ALL N9 requirements, (2) N7 path BLOCKED - needs K=3 total via L2_46 (4K effective) but board has only 2 BLACK tokens, (3) L1_7 doesn't reduce L2_52 cost (4B regardless), L2_64 (3G regardless), or L3_89 (1B+3G regardless). Timeline comparison: Take 2 BLUE now→2 BLUE Turn 20→L2_52 Turn 22 (3pts)+N9 (3pts)=7 points Turn 22. Buy L1_7 first→same path but Turn 24 (2 turns slower). In race to 15 (tied 1-1), 2 turns critical. Risk: 35% opponent takes BLUE Turn 19 blocking path, but reserving L2_52 costs same 2-turn delay. Expected value favors immediate tokens with pivot options (L2_64 3pts or L3_89 4pts) if blocked. VERIFIED: Board BLUE=4 (eligible for 2-of-same), current tokens R=1,K=1 plus take_BLUE=2 equals 4 total (under 10 limit). Free cards only valuable if advancing scoring paths - L1_7 advances N7 (blocked) not N9 (fastest). Rushing points by 2 turns outweighs free bonus.

Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_37 because it is completely free given my current bonuses. Its cost is 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN, while my current bonuses are 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, and 3 BLACK. This move is highly efficient as it expands my engine by adding a third RED bonus without spending any tokens, bringing me to within one GREEN bonus of qualifying for Noble N7 (3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, 3 RED) and one BLUE bonus of Noble N9 (3 GREEN, 3 BLUE, 3 RED). Furthermore, increasing my RED bonus to 3 makes future point-scoring cards like L2_54 more affordable.

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Buying L2_54 to score second point and establish position for Turn 23 victory push. VERIFIED: L2_54 exists on Level 2 board. Base cost 2W+3B+3R reduces to 1B effective with my bonuses (W=2 covers 2W fully, B=2 reduces 3B to 1B, R=3 covers 3R fully). I have B=2 tokens, can purchase immediately. This move is optimal because: (1) Scores point now (2-1 lead over opponent) creating pressure, (2) WHITE=3 bonus maximizes future efficiency, (3) Sets up Turn 23 L3_89 purchase (1B+3G effective) for 6 total points via token collection path: Turn 20 take W+G+K (7 tokens), Turn 21 take W+G+K (10 tokens max), Turn 22 carefully swap tokens to reach G=3 while staying at 10-token limit, Turn 23 buy L3_89 with B=1+G=3 for 4pts. Alternative of buying FREE L1_7 first delays same path to Turn 24 (1 turn slower). Alternative of taking tokens first reaches same Turn 23 timeline but delays point scoring advantage (psychological pressure on opponent). Alternative L3_84 or L2_52 paths require 5B or 7B tokens respectively (board only shows B=2), making them 2+ turns slower than L3_89's 3G token requirement (board has G=3 available). Opponent likely responds with L1_7 purchase (1G effective, BLACK=4 bonus) staying at 1pt, positioning for L2_46 (2K effective for 3pts). My Turn 23 target of 6pts vs opponent's ~4pts maintains winning trajectory to 15 prestige points.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_26 because it is completely free given my current bonuses (1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 3 RED, and 3 BLACK) and its cost (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, and 2 BLACK). This move is a strategic priority because adding this card provides my third GREEN bonus, which immediately qualifies me for Noble N7 (3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, 3 RED). This single move increases my prestige points by 3 from the noble visit, bringing my total score to 4 while preserving all my current tokens for future high-value purchases.

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL DISCOVERY: L2_59 is completely FREE to purchase! Base cost 3W+2G+3R reduces to 0 effective cost with my bonuses (W=3 covers 3W fully, G=3 covers 2G fully, R=3 covers 3R fully). VERIFIED: L2_59 exists on Level 2 board. This is a game-changing find because: (1) Scores 1 point immediately for FREE, bringing me to 3 points vs opponent's 4 points (closing gap), (2) Gives GREEN=4 bonus which improves key card costs: L3_71 reduces to 1B+1G effective (from 1B+2G), L3_89 reduces to 1B+2G effective (from 1B+3G), L2_64 reduces to 2G effective (from 3G), (3) Any delay is wasteful - free cards that score points must be taken immediately, (4) Alternative L1_7 (also FREE) gives BLACK=2 but scores 0 points and doesn't help my high-value scoring paths. Mathematical proof of superiority: L2_59 now + tokens Turn 22 + L3_71 Turn 23 = 6 points Turn 23. L1_7 first + L2_59 Turn 22 + tokens Turn 23 + L3_71 Turn 24 = 6 points Turn 24 (1 turn slower). In race to 15 where opponent has 4 points, every turn matters. After purchase: tokens unchanged B=1,R=1,K=1, bonuses W=3,B=2,G=4,R=3,K=1, score 3. Turn 22 plan: Take 2 GREEN tokens (board has G=3, eligible for 2-of-same) to enable L3_71 purchase. Turn 23: Purchase L3_71 for 1B+1G (3pts) reaching 6 total points.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_7 because it is completely free given my current bonuses (1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED, and 3 BLACK). Its cost is 3 GREEN bonuses, which I already possess. This move is highly efficient as it adds a fourth BLACK bonus to my engine without spending any tokens. Increasing my BLACK bonuses to 4 brings me closer to qualifying for Noble N3 (4 WHITE, 4 BLACK) and significantly reduces the future cost of point-scoring cards like L2_46 (3 points, 6 BLACK cost), which will then only require 2 BLACK tokens. Building this engine while preserving my current token stack is a strategic priority.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current state: 3 points, opponent 4 points. My bonuses W=3,B=2,G=4,R=3,K=1 make L3_89 (4pts) affordable at 1B+2G effective cost. I have B=1 token (perfect!) but G=0, need 2 GREEN to purchase. CRITICAL TOKEN RULE CHECK: Board has W=3,B=3,G=3,R=1,K=2 - NONE have 4+ tokens, so 2-of-same rule is BLOCKED. Must take 3 different colors. Current tokens: W=0,B=1,G=0,R=1,K=1 (3 total). Taking W+B+G gives W=1,B=2,G=1,R=1,K=1 (6 total, under 10 limit). OPTIMAL PATH: Turn 22 take W+B+G (this turn) → Turn 23 take tokens including G again (e.g., W+G+K) to reach G=2 total → Turn 24 purchase L3_89 for 1B+2G earning 4pts for 7 total points. RACING OPPONENT: Opponent at 4pts can reach 7pts Turn 23 via L2_46 (effective 2K cost, opponent has K=1+taking 1 BLACK Turn 22). By Turn 24 I'll be tied at 7pts vs opponent's 7pts. ALTERNATIVE REJECTED: Taking W+B+G then buying L3_71 Turn 23 (3pts for 6 total) leaves me behind at 6pts vs opponent's 7pts. Waiting 1 extra turn to score 4pts (L3_89) instead of 3pts (L3_71) catches me up to tied position. L3_89 also gives RED=4 bonus improving future efficiency. Taking W+B+G enables both options: L3_71 if I need emergency points Turn 23, or L3_89 if I can afford 1 more turn collecting.

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_13 because it is completely free given my current bonuses. Its cost is 1 WHITE and 2 BLACK, while my current bonuses are 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 RED, and 4 BLACK. This move is strategically optimal because adding this card provides my third BLUE bonus, which immediately qualifies me for Noble N9 (3 GREEN, 3 BLUE, 3 RED). This single move increases my prestige points by 3 from the noble visit, bringing my total score to 7 while preserving all my current tokens for subsequent high-prestige purchases.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL SCORE UPDATE: Opponent is at 7 points (not 4 - they have 2 nobles N7+N9 for 6 pts!), I'm at 3 pts. Behind 7-3, must accelerate. VERIFIED my Turn 21 token collection worked, current tokens: W=1,B=2,G=1,R=1,K=1 (6 total). KEY DECISION: (A) Buy L3_71 now for 1B+1G (cost 3W+3B+5G+3R with bonuses W=3,B=2,G=4,R=3 = 0W+1B+1G+0R, I have B=2✓,G=1✓), scores 3pts for 6 total but slow path, OR (B) Take tokens enabling L3_89 next turn. MATH: L3_89 costs 3B+6G+3R minus bonuses = 1B+2G effective. If I take W+B+G now: tokens become W=2,B=3,G=2,R=1,K=1 (9 total, under 10✓). Turn 23: Purchase L3_89 spending 1B+2G (have B=3✓,G=2✓) for 4pts → 7 total, TYING opponent 7-7. Path B reaches 7pts Turn 23 vs Path A reaches 6pts Turn 22 then needs +2 turns for next big card. In race where opponent likely buys L2_46 Turn 22/23 for 10pts, catching to 7pts quickly critical. CHOOSING W+B+G over W+G+K because W+B+G leaves B=3→buy L3_89→B=2 remaining, vs W+G+K leaves B=2→buy L3_89→B=1, better positioned for future L3_84/L3_85 (need 5B/4B effective). BOARD VERIFICATION: W=2,B=2,G=2,R=1,K=2 - NONE have 4+, must take 3 different colors. Taking W=1,B=1,G=1 legal.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I will take 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token. This strategy is primarily aimed at securing the necessary resources for high-prestige cards before the board's very limited token supply is exhausted by my opponent. Specifically, adding a second BLACK token to my 4 BLACK bonuses will allow me to purchase L2_46 (3 points) on my next turn. Furthermore, taking the single available BLUE token serves a dual purpose: it allows me to purchase L1_8 (1 point) while simultaneously blocking my opponent from potentially purchasing L3_85 (4 points), which they could nearly afford. Finally, the WHITE token advances my capacity to purchase L2_68 or move toward Noble N3 (4 WHITE, 4 BLACK).

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=5, GRN=6, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: EXECUTING TURN 23 PLAN: Purchasing L3_89 to tie opponent 7-7. VERIFIED card exists on Level 3 board. Cost calculation: Base 3B+6G+3R minus my bonuses (W=3,B=2,G=4,R=3,K=1) equals 1B+2G effective cost. Current tokens W=2,B=3,G=2,R=1,K=1 (9 total) - I have B=3✓ and G=2✓ meeting exact requirements. After purchase: tokens become W=2,B=2,G=0,R=1,K=1 (6 total), bonuses become W=3,B=2,G=4,R=4,K=1, score jumps from 3 to 7 points. This move executes my Turn 22 strategy perfectly: collected W+B+G Turn 22 specifically to enable this L3_89 purchase Turn 23. RACING ANALYSIS: Opponent at 7pts (Player 0 has nobles N7+N9 plus 1pt from cards). Board shows W=0,B=0 making opponent's likely L2_52 path (needs 4B) BLOCKED for multiple turns. Meanwhile my RED=4 bonus post-purchase positions me for future high-value cards. Alternative L3_71 (3pts for 6 total) leaves me behind at 6-7, while L2_64 also only 3pts. Scoring 4pts NOW via L3_89 ties race at 7-7, then whoever reaches 10-11pts first likely wins. Board only has G=1,R=1,K=1 available post-purchase, but my next turn can reserve+gold or pivot to Noble N3 path (needs W=4,K=4 total). L3_89's 4pts critical versus slower 3pt alternatives in close endgame.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=6}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L2_46 because it provides 3 prestige points, bringing my total score to 10. The cost of L2_46 is 6 BLACK tokens, which I can satisfy using my 4 BLACK bonuses and 2 BLACK tokens. This move is the most efficient path forward as it leverages my established engine and moves me significantly closer to the 15-point victory condition. Following this purchase, my engine (now with 5 BLACK bonuses) combined with my remaining tokens (2 WHITE, 1 BLACK, etc.) will allow me to immediately target other prestige cards like L2_68 (2 points) or L1_8 (1 point) in subsequent turns without needing to take more tokens.

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: CRITICAL SITUATION: Opponent at 10 points, I'm at 7 - close endgame race! Opponent can purchase L2_68 next turn (costs 3W+5K minus bonuses W=1,K=5 = 2W effective, opponent has W=2) reaching 12pts Turn 25. My fastest scoring path: Take B+G+K tokens Turn 24 to enable L3_71 purchase Turn 25. VERIFIED Board tokens: W=0,B=1,G=3,R=1,K=3 - no color has 4+, must take 3 different colors. L3_71 costs 3W+3B+5G+3R minus my bonuses (W=3,B=2,G=4,R=4) equals 1B+1G effective. Current tokens: W=2,B=2,G=0,R=1,K=1 (6 total). Taking B=1,G=1,K=1 gives W=2,B=3,G=1,R=1,K=2 (9 total, under 10 limit). Turn 25 plan: Purchase L3_71 spending 1B+1G for 3pts reaching 10pts total. Alternative buying L1_11 (FREE) first delays 4pt L3_85 to Turn 26 vs 3pt L3_71 Turn 25 - being at 10pts Turn 25 better than 7pts Turn 25 in tight race. Alternative buying L1_8 (1pt) only reaches 8pts Turn 24, delays L3_71 to Turn 26. In race where opponent reaches 12pts Turn 25, maximizing my Turn 25 score (10pts via L3_71) keeps me closest. After L3_71: bonuses W=3,B=2,G=4,R=4,K=2 position for L2_70 (2R,3pts) or L2_64 (2G,3pts) Turn 27 for 13pts.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L2_68 because it provides 2 prestige points, increasing my total score to 12 and bringing me significantly closer to the 15-point victory threshold. The cost for L2_68 is 3 WHITE and 5 BLACK. I can fulfill this cost using my 1 WHITE bonus and 2 WHITE tokens, along with my 5 BLACK bonuses. This move is the most efficient use of my current resources as it translates my accumulated tokens directly into points while maintaining my engine. On my next turn, I can purchase L1_8 for 1 point using my 3 BLUE bonuses and 1 BLUE token, or L1_23 for free, both of which keep the momentum toward winning.

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=5, GRN=5, RED=5, BLK=3}
Reasoning: ENDGAME CRISIS: Opponent at 12 points can purchase L2_70 (costs 6R minus 4R bonus = 2R effective, opponent has R=2 tokens) THIS TURN for 3pts reaching 15 points and WINNING. I cannot prevent this - board only has R=1 available and opponent already has R=2 tokens needed. My only strategy: MAXIMIZE MY SCORE for best final standing. Currently 7pts vs opponent's imminent 15pts. VERIFIED L3_71 exists on Level 3 board. Cost 3W+3B+5G+3R minus my bonuses (W=3,B=2,G=4,R=4) = 0W+1B+1G+0R effective. Current tokens W=2,B=3,G=1,R=1,K=2 (9 total) - have B=3 and G=1 meeting exact 1B+1G requirement. After purchase: tokens W=2,B=2,G=0,R=1,K=2 (8 total under limit), bonuses W=3,B=2,G=4,R=4,K=2, score 7+3=10pts. ALTERNATIVES INFERIOR: L1_11 (0pts) leaves me 7pts final = 15-7 deficit, L1_8 (1pt) reaches 8pts = 15-8 deficit, L2_65 (1pt) reaches 8pts. L3_71's 3pts achieves 15-10 final = smallest possible deficit. Noble N3 (needs W=4,K=4 bonuses, I have W=3,K=1→K=2 after L3_71) unattainable. No path to 15pts exists this turn. Executing Turn 25 plan: purchase L3_71 spending 1B+1G for maximum 3pt gain.

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 12, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=6, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L2_70 because it provides 3 prestige points, which immediately increases my total score from 12 to 15, reaching the victory condition. The card costs 6 RED. I currently have 4 RED bonuses and 2 RED tokens, which perfectly covers the cost. This move is the most efficient and final step to winning the game.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_70]

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: GAME OVER - Opponent won with 15 points. This is my final turn to maximize score. Currently 10pts vs opponent's 15pts. VERIFIED L2_43 available on Level 2 board. Cost B=1,G=4,R=2 minus my bonuses B=2,G=4,R=4 equals 0 effective cost (FREE). Gives 2 prestige points. Alternatives: L1_35 (FREE, 0pts), L1_11 (FREE, 0pts), L2_65 (1K token, 1pt), L1_8 (2B tokens, 1pt). L2_43 optimal: FREE purchase earning 2pts brings me to 12pts final score. After purchase: bonuses become W=3,B=2,G=4,R=4,K=3. Cannot reach N3 noble (requires W=4,K=4) this turn. No Level 3 cards affordable. Final score: 12pts vs opponent's 15pts.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_43]
