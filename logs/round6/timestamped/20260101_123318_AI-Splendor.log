2026-01-01 12:34:20.236 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 1 strategy: I need to reach 15 prestige points. Analysis shows that Level 3 cards (4-5 prestige each) are the most efficient path to victory. Key bottleneck analysis: (1) BLUE is heavily needed for high-value Level 3 cards like L3_86 (requires 7 BLUE for 5 prestige) and L3_85, making it critical to start accumulating early; (2) L1_31 (RED:3 cost) is the cheapest Level 1 path to a GREEN bonus, which improves cost efficiency for Level 3 GREEN-bonus cards; (3) Taking 3 different colors is superior to taking 2 of one color on turn 1 because it preserves maximum strategic flexibility. On turn 1, with no tokens and no cards, the best play is to build a diverse token foundation. Taking BLUE, GREEN, RED (1 each) gives me: immediate progress toward L1_31 (RED:1 of 3 needed), accumulation of scarce BLUE for late-game Level 3 cards, and GREEN flexibility. This doesn't over-commit me to a single path and keeps my options open for either the RED/GREEN or BLUE-focused strategies depending on what opponent does next.

2026-01-01 12:34:27.827 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Opening turn analysis: I'm Player 1 with no tokens or bonuses. Looking at available cards, L1_40 offers excellent value - it's a LEVEL_1 card with RED bonus AND 1 prestige point for just 4 WHITE cost. This is much more efficient than typical LEVEL_1 cards (usually 0 prestige, 1 bonus). With no tokens, I can't afford to purchase any visible card directly. My best move is to reserve L1_40 to: 1) secure this high-value card before opponent can take it, 2) get 1 gold token to help pay for it next turn, 3) start building my engine. The 4 WHITE cost will be easy to gather, and the guaranteed prestige point accelerates me toward the 15-point goal. Taking tokens now would be less efficient since I'd still need multiple turns to afford any card, while reserving this gives me both a target and a gold bonus.

2026-01-01 12:35:15.571 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 2 Analysis: I ended Turn 1 with BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (3 tokens total, well under the 10-token limit). My strategic plan is: (1) accumulate RED tokens to purchase L1_31 (RED:3 cost) and gain GREEN bonus, and (2) accumulate BLUE tokens aggressively since BLUE is the scarce bottleneck for high-prestige Level 3 cards like L3_86 (costs BLUE:7 for 5 prestige).

Board Token Availability Check: WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:4 (all colors available).

Opponent's Move: They've reserved L1_40 (RED bonus card) and hold 1 GOLD token, suggesting they're pursuing a RED/WHITE strategy. This actually supports my alternative GREEN bonus strategy—minimal direct competition.

Token Strategy: I cannot take RED:2 (board only has 3 RED available, and the rule requires 4+ on board to take 2 of same color). So I must take 3 different colors. Best combination: BLUE, RED, BLACK.
- BLUE:2 (scarce resource accumulation—critical for Level 3 win condition)
- RED:2 (one step away from L1_31 purchase; need only 1 more RED)
- BLACK:1 (flexibility for Level 2 card synergies)
- New total: 6 tokens (safe, under limit of 10)

This maintains my dual-track accumulation: RED progress toward GREEN bonus, and BLUE progress toward end-game Level 3 cards. Taking BLACK instead of WHITE or GREEN balances my portfolio—I already have GREEN, and WHITE is less critical for my identified path.

No cards are affordable yet with my current tokens, so token accumulation is the optimal action.

I currently have 1 gold token from reserving L1_40. Looking at available tokens on the board, WHITE has 4 available, GREEN has 3, and BLUE has only 2. My strategy is to take WHITE, GREEN, and BLUE tokens now. This gives me 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLUE for a total of 3 tokens. Combined with my existing gold, I'll have 4 tokens total. Next turn I can take 3 more WHITE tokens (there are 4 available), which will give me 4 WHITE total. Then I can purchase L1_40 using my 4 WHITE + 1 gold substitute = 5 cost. This is the most efficient path to securing the 1 prestige point from L1_40. Taking these 3 different colors also keeps my token options open for future noble visits or other purchases.

2026-01-01 12:36:41.237 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **TURN 3 ANALYSIS:**

Current state: I hold BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 (6 tokens total). My strategic goal is to purchase L1_31 (costs RED:3, grants GREEN bonus) as the foundation for accessing high-value Level 3 prestige cards.

**CRITICAL RULE CLARIFICATION:**
Token-taking rules permit:
- EXACTLY 3 tokens of 3 DIFFERENT colors (set each to 1), OR
- Exactly 2 tokens of SAME color (only if 4+ available on board)

Board availability: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:3

**STRATEGIC TARGET: RED:3 FOR L1_31 PURCHASE**
L1_31 is the bottleneck card—it costs only RED:3 and grants a GREEN bonus card, which reduces future costs significantly. Currently I have RED:2; I need RED:1 more to unlock this card next turn.

**OPTIMAL PLAY: TAKE BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1**

Reasoning:
- BLUE:1 → After: BLUE:3 (critical scarcity accumulation). BLUE is the bottleneck for highest-value Level 3 cards. L3_86 (5 prestige for BLUE:7, GREEN:3) is my primary end-game target.
- RED:1 → After: RED:3 (reaches threshold for L1_31 purchase on Turn 4)
- BLACK:1 → After: BLACK:2 (adds flexibility for Level 2 synergies)

**TOKEN COUNT VERIFICATION:**
Current: 6 tokens
Taking: 3 tokens (1 each of BLUE, RED, BLACK)
Total after: 9 tokens ✓ (under 10-token limit, no return needed)

**BOARD AVAILABILITY CHECK:**
BLUE:1 on board ≥ 1 needed ✓
RED:2 on board ≥ 1 needed ✓
BLACK:3 on board ≥ 1 needed ✓

**CANNOT CURRENTLY PURCHASE ANY CARDS:**
Verified all face-up cards—none are affordable with BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1.

**POST-TURN 3 STATE:**
Tokens: BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:2
→ Turn 4: Purchase L1_31, gaining GREEN bonus card
→ Unlocks efficient pathways to L3_85 and L3_86 for prestige accumulation
→ Aligns with long-term strategy of building to 15 prestige via Level 3 high-value cards

2026-01-01 12:36:52.525 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I need to analyze my current situation. I have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:1 (4 total tokens). My goal is to purchase L1_40 which costs 4 WHITE. Currently I only have 1 WHITE, so I need 3 more.

Available tokens: WHITE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, BLUE:0

My options:
1. Take 3 WHITE - only possible if 4+ available, but only 3 available
2. Take WHITE, GREEN, RED (3 different colors) - this gives me WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, GOLD:1 = 6 tokens total
3. Reserve a card to get a gold token and secure a good card

Option 2 would leave me at 6 tokens (need to return 1 next turn), and I'd still only have 2 WHITE - not enough for L1_40.

Instead, I'll reserve L2_48 (LEVEL_2 card with BLUE bonus and 1 prestige point for 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK). This is an excellent card that: 
1) Secures a valuable BLUE bonus that will help pay for future high-level cards
2) Gets me 1 gold token to add to my collection
3) Keeps my options open for collecting WHITE tokens next turn

The BLUE bonus on L2_48 is particularly valuable since BLUE is 0 on the board, making it scarce. By reserving now, I ensure I'll have access to this bonus. I can continue collecting WHITE tokens next turn without pressure, and I'll have 5 tokens after this action (4 existing + 1 gold), which is manageable since I'll need to return tokens anyway when I exceed 10.

After reserving, I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:2 = 5 tokens. Next turn I can take WHITE, GREEN, RED to continue building toward L1_40 while keeping my total at 6 (returning 1).

2026-01-01 12:37:22.814 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 4: Execute foundational strategy by purchasing L1_31 (GREEN bonus card). Current token state: BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:2 (9 total). L1_31 costs exactly RED:3 and is immediately affordable. This purchase is CRITICAL for my strategic plan: the GREEN:1 bonus reduces future costs for high-prestige Level 3 cards. Specifically: (1) L3_86 (5 prestige) normally costs BLUE:7+GREEN:3 → becomes BLUE:7+GREEN:2 with my bonus = massive efficiency gain; (2) L3_85 (4 prestige) normally costs BLUE:6+GREEN:3 → becomes BLUE:6+GREEN:2 with bonus. The GREEN bonus card acts as a force multiplier for my endgame strategy of reaching 15 prestige via Level 3 high-value cards. Board constraint note: BLUE is now depleted at 0 on board, making token accumulation limited, but this is manageable since I'm transitioning from Phase 1 (accumulation) to Phase 2 (purchasing with bonuses). Verdict: Execute the purchase immediately to lock in the efficiency gain. Post-purchase state: tokens BLUE:3, GREEN:1, BLACK:2 (6 total); bonus GREEN:1; purchased L1_31; score 0.

2026-01-01 12:37:34.772 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:2 (5 tokens total). My two reserved cards are L1_40 (costs 4 WHITE, gives 1 prestige) and L2_48 (costs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK, gives 1 prestige). I need to focus on completing L1_40 first since it's much more achievable.

To purchase L1_40, I need 4 WHITE tokens. I currently have 1 WHITE, so I need 3 more. The board shows WHITE:3 available, which means I can take exactly 3 WHITE tokens in one action (requires 4+ available, and 3≥4? Wait, no - taking 3 requires 4+ available, and the board shows 3 available).

Actually, I can only take 3 of the same color if 4+ are available. Since WHITE has exactly 3 available, I cannot take 3 WHITE.

My options:
1. Take WHITE, GREEN, RED (3 different colors) - gives me WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, GOLD:2 = 6 tokens
2. Reserve a card for gold

With 3 WHITE available, I can take all of them (3 tokens) since 3≥3 is valid. This leaves WHITE:0 on the board. After this action, I'll have WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:2 = 6 tokens total, which is still well under 10.

Then next turn I can purchase L1_40 (cost: 4 WHITE, I have 4, so exactly affordable!) and gain 1 prestige point plus a RED bonus. This is the most efficient path to scoring my first points.

Taking 3 WHITE tokens is legal (requires 4+ available, and 3 are available), so this action is valid.

Final token count: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:2 = 6 tokens total.

Wait, I miscalculated - taking 3 tokens requires 4+ available, but only 3 are available, so I CANNOT take 3 WHITE. I need to take 3 different colors instead.

Let me take WHITE, GREEN, and RED (3 different colors). Available: WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:4. All have enough tokens.

This gives me WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, GOLD:2 = 6 tokens total. Then next turn I can take more WHITE tokens to complete L1_40.

Actually wait, I can take all 3 WHITE tokens since 3>=3 (the requirement is 4+ to take 3, so 3 is NOT enough). I cannot take 3 WHITE.

So my options are:
- Take WHITE, GREEN, RED (3 different) - valid
- Take 3 WHITE - INVALID (only 3 available, need 4+)

I'll take WHITE, GREEN, and RED tokens to continue building toward L1_40 while staying under 10 tokens.

After this: WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, GOLD:2 = 6 tokens. Next turn I can take more WHITE tokens.

Available tokens: WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:2, BLUE:0

Looking at my options:
1. Take 3 WHITE - only possible if 4+ available, but only 3 available
2. Take WHITE, GREEN, RED (3 different colors) - gives me WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, GOLD:2 = 7 tokens (would need to return 2)
3. Take GREEN, RED, and another color

Since I can only take 3 tokens per turn and need 3 more WHITE, I'll take 3 different colors that don't include WHITE to avoid exceeding 10 tokens later. I'll take GREEN, RED, and BLACK tokens.

After taking: GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:2 = 8 tokens total

This gives me tokens for future purchases while I strategically position to gather WHITE tokens next turn when they replenish. The BLACK tokens will help with L2_48 (needs 3 BLACK), and RED tokens help with L1_18 (needs 1 RED). I'm keeping my options open for multiple purchase paths while building toward L1_40.

2026-01-01 12:39:29.927 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **TURN 5 STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**

Current game state: I hold BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:2 (6 tokens, 9 under limit). Bonuses: GREEN:1. Score: 0.

**CRITICAL BOTTLENECK DISCOVERED:**
The board now shows BLUE:0 (depleted). This is a game-state change that invalidates my original strategy of purchasing L3_86 (which requires BLUE:7). My previous reasoning assumed BLUE would continue to accumulate on board through player turns, but that has not occurred. I must pivot.

**REVISED PATH ANALYSIS:**

Feasible Level 3 targets given current board:
1. **L3_76 (WHITE-only, 4 prestige)**: Costs WHITE:7 only. No bonuses apply (WHITE-only card). Straightforward accumulation path, though resource-intensive.
2. **L3_73 (4 prestige)**: Costs GREEN:3, RED:6, BLACK:3. This is the closest alternative path and plays to tokens I'm already accumulating.
3. **L3_85 (4 prestige)**: Costs BLUE:6+GREEN:3 (→ BLUE:6+GREEN:2 with my bonus). Still blocked by BLUE shortage.

** Optimal prestige target:** Combination of L3_76 + L3_73 + Level 2 prestige cards (L2_56: 2 prestige, L2_57: 2 prestige) + Noble (N5 or others: 3 prestige) = 4+4+2+2+3 = 15 prestige.

**TOKEN STRATEGY FOR TURN 5:**

Board availability: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:1

I cannot take 2 of the same color for most options (need 4+ on board; BLACK only has 1). RED has 4, so RED:2 is technically available, but diversifying is more valuable.

Optimal take: **RED:1, WHITE:1, BLACK:1** (3 different colors)
- RED:1 → After: RED:1 (start RED accumulation for L3_73, L2_57, L2_56, and noble N5)
- WHITE:1 → After: WHITE:1 (start WHITE accumulation for L3_76)
- BLACK:1 → After: BLACK:3 (substantial BLACK position for L3_73 and nobles)

**Token verification:**
- Current: 6 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens (1 RED + 1 WHITE + 1 BLACK)
- After: 9 tokens (under 10-token limit, no returns needed) ✓

**Board check:**
- RED:4 ≥ 1 ✓
- WHITE:3 ≥ 1 ✓
- BLACK:1 ≥ 1 ✓

**Post-Turn 5 state:**
- Tokens: BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3, WHITE:1 (9 total)
- This diversified position allows me to pivot based on future board state and opponent moves while progressing toward both multi-path Level 3 targets and nobles.

**Why not RED:2?**
Faster RED accumulation but ignores WHITE, leaving me bottlenecked on L3_76. Diversification provides optionality.

**Why not reserve a card (for GOLD)?**
Token accumulation now is more valuable than locking in flexibility later. Once I can afford tech/prestige cards, reserve slots will open naturally.

This gives me: 1) 1 gold token (going to 10 tokens total, perfectly legal), 2) secures the card which has RED bonus + 1 prestige point, 3) continues my engine building. I now have 3 copies of L1_40 reserved, and once I get more WHITE tokens, I'll be able to purchase multiple copies for massive efficiency. My opponent just purchased L1_31 (GREEN bonus), so I need to keep developing my own engine. With 10 tokens after this action, I'm perfectly positioned to start purchasing once I gather more WHITE tokens next turn.

I have 1 WHITE, need 3 more. Since only 2 WHITE are available, I cannot take 3 WHITE. I'll take WHITE, GREEN, and RED (3 different colors). This gives me:
- WHITE: 2 total (closer to the 4 needed for L1_40)
- GREEN: 3 total (helps with future purchases like L1_28)
- RED: 1 total (helps with L1_18 which needs 1 RED)

After this action: 8 tokens total, staying under the 10-token limit. Next turn I should have more WHITE tokens available to continue building toward L1_40.

2026-01-01 12:42:04.422 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 6 CRITICAL STATE ANALYSIS:

current position: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 (9 tokens), GREEN:1 bonus, 0 prestige.

BOARD DEPLETION SEVERE: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:3. Only 2 colors available on board prevents valid TAKE_TOKENS action (requires EXACTLY 3 different colors OR 2 of same color with 4+ on board—neither possible).

OPPONENT THREAT: Opponent (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2) can purchase L2_42 next turn (1 prestige) using GOLD:2 substitution (pays WHITE:2+GOLD:1 for WHITE:3, GREEN:3✓, BLACK:1+GOLD:1 for BLACK:2). This puts opponent at +1 prestige while I remain at 0—critical scoring deficit.

PRESTIGE PATH ANALYSIS:
- Level 3 cards BLOCKED: L3_86/L3_85 require BLUE:6-7 (depleted), L3_76 requires WHITE:7 (only 1 available, impossible accumulation), L3_73 requires RED:6 (only 2 available, need 4 more).
- Level 2 achievable paths: L2_60 (costs WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2—achievable: take WHITE:1 next turn, then buy turn 8). L2_57 (costs RED:5 only—harder but higher prestige: 2 points).

ACTION OPTIONS:
1. BUY L1_28 (frees tokens, adds GREEN:2 bonus): Doesn't advance prestige, wastes turn.
2. BUY L1_18 (frees tokens, adds WHITE:1 bonus): Doesn't advance prestige, wastes turn.
3. RESERVE L2_57 (get GOLD:1, draw new Level 2 card): Gains GOLD token for future GOLD-substitution flexibility, refreshes board state with new card, secures path to 2-prestige card, puts me at token capacity (10) while converting resource scarcity into stored value.

OPTIMAL PLAY: Reserve L2_57. RATIONALE: (1) GOLD:1 provides color-substitution flexibility for future purchases—opponent will have 0 GOLD after Turn 7 L2_42 purchase, giving me next-turn GOLD advantage. (2) Reserving visible card triggers replacement draw—new Level 2 card created, improving board state. (3) Locks in L2_57 (2 prestige) as secured target: if opponent reaches 3 prestige, I can still acquire 2 prestige from L2_57 + catch up with other cards. (4) Cannot TAKE_TOKENS (board constraint), so freeing token slots via purchase is less valuable than securing GOLD + triggering board refresh.

POST-TURN 6 STATE: BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3, WHITE:1, GOLD:1 (10 tokens, at capacity). Next turn: take WHITE:1 (if available), accumulate resources for L2_57 or L2_60 purchases turns 8-10.

I need to purchase L1_40 (needs 4 WHITE) but only have 2 WHITE and only 1 WHITE is available on the board. I cannot take tokens without returning some first. The most strategic move is to reserve L2_56 to get a gold token. L2_56 costs 5 RED and 3 BLACK with 0 WHITE cost - perfect since I have no WHITE requirement for this card. It also provides 2 prestige points and a WHITE bonus which is excellent. By reserving, I'll get to 11 tokens, return 1 token to stay at 10, and position myself to gather the RED and BLACK tokens needed for L2_56 over future turns. This keeps my engine building on track while efficiently managing my token count.

Since I'm at the 10-token limit, I cannot reserve (would gain a gold token and exceed 10). Taking 3 WHITE is impossible (only 1 available). The only legal move is to take 3 different colors: WHITE, GREEN, and RED. After taking: WHITE:3, GREEN:4, RED:2. This gets me closer to the 4 WHITE needed for L1_40 while staying at exactly 10 tokens. Next turn, I should have more WHITE tokens available to complete L1_40.

My reserved L1_40 card costs 4 WHITE tokens. I have 2 WHITE tokens + 2 GOLD tokens, where each GOLD can substitute for 1 WHITE token. This means I have exactly enough to purchase L1_40 (2 WHITE + 2 GOLD = 4 WHITE equivalent). Purchasing this card gives me 1 prestige point and a RED bonus, moving me toward the 15-point goal. This also frees up space in my reserved cards for future strategic reservations. The RED bonus will help with higher-level cards like L1_18 which costs 1 RED. This is the optimal move as I'm using my tokens efficiently and scoring a point while maintaining token balance at 8 tokens after purchase (BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0).

2026-01-01 12:44:08.445 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 7 CRITICAL STATE ANALYSIS:

Current position: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 (9 tokens), GREEN:1 bonus, 0 prestige, L2_57 reserved (2 prestige potential).

OPPONENT STATUS: Opponent at +1 prestige (1 point) with L2_48 reserved (1 more prestige if purchased). They're ahead and advancing.

BOARD SCARCITY CRISIS: Only WHITE:3, RED:2 available (others depleted). This creates IMPOSSIBLE TAKE_TOKENS situation:
- Cannot take 3 different colors (only 2 colors with stock: WHITE, RED)
- Cannot take 2 same color (neither has 4+ required)
- Therefore, TAKE_TOKENS is INVALID this turn

PURCHASE ANALYSIS:
Verified all affordable cards with current tokens (W:1, B:3, G:1, R:1, K:3, bonus G:1):
- L1_28: Affordable (effectively WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:0 with bonus), but gives 0 prestige—wasting turn
- L1_18, L1_10: Affordable, but again 0 prestige
- L2_60, L2_42, L2_50: All require resources I lack (short on WHITE or BLUE)
- L2_57 (my reserved card): Requires RED:5, I have RED:1—not affordable
- L3_85, L3_86, L3_76, L3_73: All unaffordable (need accumulated resources)

STRATEGIC DECISION: RESERVE L3_86 (highest-prestige card, 5 POINTS)

Rationale:
1. **Prestige race**: Opponent at +1 point. I'm at 0. Securing 5 prestige points in hand (L3_86) + 2 in reserve (L2_57) = 7 total prestige potential is critical to catch up and reverse scoring deficit.
2. **Card denial**: Prevents opponent from reserving L3_86 themselves. This card is the highest-ROI prestige card on board.
3. **GOLD token conversion**: Gain GOLD:1 (if available—board shows GOLD:4). GOLD provides color-substitution flexibility, mitigating board token scarcity. With GOLD, future purchases can bridge color gaps.
4. **Board refresh cycle**: Reserving Level 3 card triggers new Level 3 card draw, refreshing face-up options. Current Level 3 set (L3_85, L3_76, L3_86, L3_73) may be less favorable than replacement.
5. **Token capacity aligned with board state**: Reaching 10-token maximum (9 + 1 GOLD) is acceptable because board scarcity prevents effective accumulation anyway. This trade (hitting capacity for prestige insurance) is justified given circumstances.

POST-TURN 7 STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (10 total, at capacity)
- Reserved: L2_57 (2 prestige), L3_86 (5 prestige) = 7 prestige secured
- Bonuses: GREEN:1
- Score: 0 (but positioned to unlock prestige if resources allow)

NEXT TURN STRATEGY: If board refreshes with RED tokens, accumulate for L2_57 purchase (RED:5, 2 prestige). If BLUE floods board, work toward L3_86 (BLUE:7, GREEN:3-1=2 effective, 5 prestige). GOLD token enables color substitution to accelerate purchases.

2026-01-01 12:45:12.316 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: CRITICAL TURN: I'm at 10 tokens (at capacity) with a severely depleted board (only WHITE:3, RED:2 available—no BLUE, GREEN, or BLACK). I CANNOT take tokens (require EXACTLY 3 different colors OR 2 of same with 4+ on board; neither is possible). I must break the token stalemate by purchasing a card.

**GOLD TOKEN SUBSTITUTION BREAKTHROUGH:**
I can afford L2_60 using GOLD:1 as a wildcard!
- L2_60 costs: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2
- I have: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1
- Payment: WHITE:1 gem + GOLD:1 token (= WHITE:2 paid), BLUE:3 gems, BLACK:2 gems
- **VALID!**

**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**
1. PRESTIGE GAIN: +1 prestige point (currently 0 → 1, matches opponent at 1-1, breaks prestige deficit)
2. BONUS: GREEN:1 bonus (cumulative GREEN:2 with L1_31)
3. TOKEN LIBERATION: Frees 7 token slots (10 total → 3 total after purchase), enabling future accumulation and reserve moves
4. ENDGAME ADVANTAGE: With GREEN:2 bonus, future GREEN-heavy cards become dramatically cheaper
   - L3_86 (5 prestige): BLUE:7, GREEN:3 → becomes BLUE:7, GREEN:1 with GREEN:2 bonus
   - L3_73 (4 prestige): GREEN:3, RED:6, BLACK:3 → becomes RED:6, BLACK:3 with GREEN:2 bonus

**WHY NOT L1_28?**
Alternative gives GREEN:2 bonus without GOLD cost, but ZERO prestige. Mid-game prestige is critical to avoid falling into unrecoverable deficit. Opponent is at 1 prestige; I must maintain parity.

**POST-PURCHASE STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (3 total)
- Score: 1 prestige (1-1 vs opponent)
- Bonuses: GREEN:2 (L1_31 + L2_60)
- Purchased: L1_31, L2_60
- Next turn: Can reserve cards (GOLD available on board), accumulate tokens if board refreshes colors, or position for L2_56, L2_57, or nobles

**CONCLUSION:** Purchase L2_60 to escape token stalemate, achieve prestige parity, multiply future GREEN-discount purchasing power, and regain strategic flexibility.

This gives me enough for L1_10 (1 WHITE + 2 RED + 1 BLACK + 3 GREEN = all covered) and positions me for L2_48 with more BLUE tokens. I stay under 10 tokens, and the RED tokens also help with other cards like L2_70 (6 RED cost, 3 prestige). If I took WHITE, BLUE, BLACK instead, I'd still need 1 more RED for L1_10. Taking different colors keeps my options open.

2026-01-01 12:47:09.977 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 8 OPTIMAL PLAY - PRESTIGE ACCUMULATION PHASE:

CURRENT POSITION:
- Tokens: GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (3 total, well under 10-token limit)
- Score: 1 prestige (TIED with opponent at 1-1)
- Bonuses: GREEN:2 (from L1_31 + L2_60) - multiplicative advantage factor
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5 cost, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus)
- Strategic advantage: GREEN:2 bonus dramatically reduces future prestige card costs

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
- Opponent: 1 prestige, 9 tokens, RED:1 bonus from L1_40
- Board severely depleted: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:5
- Only 5 colors available (GREEN completely gone from board)
- Opponent positioned to make moves; I must maintain prestige parity through tokens

CRITICAL BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION:
**RED TOKEN SCARCITY:** Board shows only RED:1 remaining - this is the game's most constrained resource. RED is needed for:
- L2_57 (RED:5 cost, 2 prestige, currently reserved)
- L3_73 (RED:6 base, reduced to RED:6-BLACK:3 with GREEN:2 bonus, 4 prestige)
- L2_70 (RED:6 cost, 3 prestige)
- N5 noble (RED:4, BLACK:4 for 3 prestige)

Taking RED:1 NOW prevents opponent from accumulating RED while ensuring I don't get stranded on RED:0.

VALID TOKEN COMBINATIONS ANALYSIS:
Board state (WHITE:3, BLUE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2) permits:
1. WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 ← OPTIMAL
2. WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLUE:1
3. WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + BLACK:1
4. RED:1 + BLUE:1 + BLACK:1
(Cannot use same-color rule: no color has 4+ tokens)

OPTIMAL SELECTION: WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1

STRATEGIC RATIONALE:

1. **CAPTURE CRITICAL RED (1 token remaining):** 
   - RED is irreplaceable without board refresh
   - Essential for L2_57 (next prestige card I can afford, 2 prestige)
   - Essential for L3_73 path (my target Level 3 card, 4 prestige)
   - Taking RED:1 moves me to RED:2 total, 3 more needed for L2_57, 4 more for L3_73

2. **ADVANCE BLACK ACCUMULATION (supports prestige convergence):**
   - Current: BLACK:1 → After: BLACK:2
   - L3_73 needs BLACK:3 (need 1 more after this turn)
   - L2_56 needs BLACK:3 (need 1 more after this turn)
   - N5 noble needs BLACK:4 (need 2 more after this turn)
   - BLACK is my second-scarcest bottleneck (2 on board)
   - BLACK + RED + GREEN:2 bonus = L3_73 purchase in 2-3 turns

3. **PRESERVE WHITE ABUNDANCE & FLEXIBILITY:**
   - WHITE:3 available; taking only WHITE:1 leaves WHITE:2 for future flexibility
   - Supports nobles N8 & N6 (each need WHITE:3)
   - Helps L3_76 pivot if needed (WHITE:7)
   - WHITE:1 is lower-priority than RED:1 or BLACK:1

WHY NOT BLUE:1 INSTEAD OF WHITE:1?
- L3_86 (BLUE:7, GREEN:3 → reduced to BLUE:7, GREEN:1 with bonus) requires massive BLUE accumulation
- Only BLUE:2 on board; unrealistic to accumulate 7 BLUE given opponent competition
- L3_73 (RED:6, BLACK:3 with bonus) is achievable with current board dynamics
- RED scarcity makes RED prioritization win over BLUE optionality

TOKEN CAPACITY CHECK:
- Current: 3 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens (1 WHITE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK)
- Total after: 6 tokens ✓ (under 10-token limit, no returns needed)

BOARD VERIFICATION:
- WHITE:3 ≥ 1 ✓
- RED:1 ≥ 1 ✓
- BLACK:2 ≥ 1 ✓

RULE COMPLIANCE:
- Exactly 3 tokens ✓
- Exactly 3 different colors ✓
- Valid Splendor move ✓

POST-ACTION STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2 (6 total)
- Board after: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:5
- Score: 1 prestige (parity maintained)

NEXT TURNS ROADMAP:
- Turns 9-10: Take GOLD or other tokens to accumulate RED:5 total
- Turn 11-12: Purchase L2_57 (RED:5 cost) → Move to 3 prestige, gain WHITE:1 bonus
- Turns 12-14: Accumulate RED:6, BLACK:3 toward L3_73
- Turn 15+: Chase nobles (N5, N8, N6) + prestige cards to 15

WHY NOT RESERVE L3_86 OR L3_73?
- Reserving gets GOLD:1 + board refresh, but delays prestige generation
- I'm TIED 1-1 with opponent: prestige points now > optionality later
- Taking tokens allows me to purchase L2_57 (2 prestige) and move to 3 prestige within 2-3 turns
- If opponent purchases a prestige card while I'm gaining none, I fall behind (1 vs 2)
- Reserve strategy is better when I have a prestige lead to consolidate with GOLD flexibility

CONCLUSION: In a tied prestige race with severe board depletion, token accumulation prioritizing RED (scarcest resource) and BLACK (prestige-critical) is superior to locking in future cards. This accelerates my path to L2_57 (2 prestige) within 2 turns, maintaining competitive parity while building toward L3_73 (4 prestige) endgame sequences.

2026-01-01 12:47:23.634 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:1). My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK = 8 total cost. I have BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1 - still need 2 more BLACK.

Available tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1

Options analysis:
- Take tokens: Only 1 BLACK available, GREEN/RED are 0, so I can only take WHITE+BLUE+BLACK. But I'd still need 1 more BLACK for L2_48.
- Purchase L1_10: Costs 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED, 1 BLACK. I have exactly what I need! This gives me a BLUE bonus.
- Purchase L1_18: Costs 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK. Also exact match, gives WHITE bonus.
- Purchase L1_28: Costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. I have BLUE:2, short by 1 BLUE.

L1_10 is optimal because:
1) Uses ALL my tokens (no waste, no returns needed)
2) Gives me a BLUE bonus (same as L2_48's bonus - helpful for future)
3) Reduces my token count from 9 to 5, keeping me well under the 10 limit
4) Leaves me with BLUE:3 bonus, which directly contributes to L2_48's 2 BLUE requirement

After purchase: BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:0, WHITE:0, BLACK:0 = 5 tokens total, with BLUE bonus for future purchases.

2026-01-01 12:49:15.677 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 9 STRATEGIC ANALYSIS: SECURE SCARCEST RESOURCE & ACCELERATE L2_57 COMPLETION

CURRENT STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2 (6 total, 4 capacity remaining)
- Score: 1 prestige (TIED 1-1 with opponent)
- Bonuses: GREEN:2 (from L1_31 + L2_60)
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5 cost, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus) ← PRIMARY TARGET
- Board: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:5

CRITICAL RESOURCE BOTTLENECK IDENTIFIED:
**RED TOKEN SCARCITY - Only 1 RED remaining on board.** This is the most constrained resource in the game:
- Red is essential for L2_57 (RED:5 required, I have RED:2, need 3 more)
- RED is essential for L3_73 endgame (RED:6 base cost, 4 prestige)
- If I don't take RED:1 NOW, board will have RED:0 after my move, making RED unavailable until a card purchase/reserve triggers deck refresh
- Opponent has RED:1 token; if they acquire RED bonus cards later, they'll compete for scarce RED pool

PRESTIGE CONVERGENCE PATHWAY:
1. **L2_57 (2 prestige)**: After taking RED:1 → RED:3 total. Need RED:2 more = 1-2 turns of accumulation if board refreshes occur
2. **L3_73 (4 prestige)**: Costs RED:6+BLACK:3 (with GREEN:2 bonus reducing from GREEN:3+RED:6+BLACK:3). After this turn, I'll have BLACK:3✓, RED:3 (need 3 more) = achievable after L2_57
3. **Combined path: L2_57 (2) + L3_73 (4) + other prestige = 6+ prestige from these two cards alone**

OPTIMAL TOKEN COMBINATION: WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1

Rationale:
- **RED:1**: MUST TAKE - last RED on board, irreplaceable without refresh
- **BLACK:1**: After taking, BLACK:3 total = satisfies BLACK requirement for L3_73 endpoint immediately
- **WHITE:1**: Ancillary but prudent; maintains optionality for nobles (N8, N6 both require WHITE:3+) and future WHITE-based cards

WHY NOT PURCHASE L1_21 (RED:2+BLACK:1 → WHITE:1 bonus)?:
- Costs RED:2+BLACK:1 resources I need for prestige path
- Frees tokens (9→6) but doesn't advance prestige (0 points)
- In a tied prestige race (1-1), generating prestige now > accumulating token space for future
- L2_57 purchase within 1-2 turns is higher EV than gambling on WHITE:1 bonus utility

VERIFICATION:
- Current tokens: 6
- Taking: 3 tokens (exactly 3 different colors) ✓
- New total: 9 ≤ 10 ✓
- Board availability: WHITE:3≥1 ✓, RED:1≥1 ✓, BLACK:2≥1 ✓
- No returns needed ✓

POST-ACTION STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3 (9 total)
- L2_57 progress: RED:3 of 5 required (need RED:2 more)
- L3_73 progress: RED:3 of 6 required, BLACK:3 of 3✓ (need RED:3 more after L2_57)
- Score: 1 prestige (parity maintained)

NEXT TURN ROADMAP:
- Turns 10-11: Accumulate RED:2 more (via board refresh or token takes if available)
- Turn 12: Purchase L2_57 → +2 prestige (1 → 3 total), gain WHITE:1 bonus, establish prestige lead
- Turns 13-15: Accumulate toward L3_73 (4 prestige) to reach 7 prestige + nobles/other prestige cards for final push to 15

CONCLUSION: Capturing RED:1 (last unit on board) is mandatory to prevent board depletion from blocking the highest-EV prestige path. This move simultaneously satisfies BLACK:3 requirement for L3_73, bringing multiple prestige targets into achievable range within 3-4 turns.

Available tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

I have 5 tokens total, can take up to 5 more. I should take GREEN + 2 other colors. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK is optimal because:
- 1 GREEN gets me closer to the 3 GREEN needed
- 1 BLACK starts my collection toward the 3 BLACK needed
- The WHITE gives me flexibility for future purchases like L1_28 (needs 1 WHITE) or L2_42 (needs 3 WHITE)

After this action: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1 (8 tokens total)

Next turn, I'll focus on taking BLACK tokens to complete my L2_48 requirements. If BLACK runs out, I'll take BLUE or other colors needed for higher prestige cards like L2_70 (needs 6 RED).

2026-01-01 12:51:16.293 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 10 CRITICAL DECISION: ESCAPE TOKEN STARVATION VIA STRATEGIC CARD PURCHASE

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3 (9 total, 1 capacity remaining)
- Score: 1 prestige (tied with opponent 1-1)
- Board: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GOLD:5 available; RED:0, GREEN:0, BLACK:0 (SEVERELY DEPLETED)
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus)
- Bonuses: GREEN:2

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
I CANNOT TAKE TOKENS this turn:
- Rule requires EXACTLY 3 different colors OR EXACTLY 2 of same color with 4+ on board
- Only WHITE:1 and BLUE:2 available (2 colors, insufficient)
- BLUE only has 2 (below 4+ threshold for same-color rule)
- Invalid move, am locked at capacity

**AVAILABLE ACTIONS:**
1. Purchase L1_21 (RED:2, BLACK:1 → WHITE bonus, 0 prestige) ✓ AFFORDABLE
2. Reserve a card (get GOLD:1, lock in prestige card)
3. No other cards affordable

**BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS:**
My prestige targets all require RED accumulation:
- L2_57 (reserved): RED:5, need RED:2 more
- L2_70: RED:6, need RED:3 more
- L3_73: RED:6 (with GREEN:2 bonus), need RED:3 more
- N5 noble: RED:4, BLACK:4 (I have BLACK:3, RED:3—need RED:1 + BLACK:1 to trigger!)

With RED:0 on board, I cannot accumulate RED without:
1. Freeing token slots to take future tokens (if board refreshes with RED)
2. Purchasing a RED-bonus card (none affordable)
3. Converting cards via purchase

**OPPONENT THREAT:**
Opponent (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0) holds L2_48 (BLUE:2✓, GREEN:3✓, BLACK:3, need BLACK:2 more). Opponent is one prestige purchase away from 2-1 prestige lead. I must regain initiative.

**PURCHASING L1_21 LOGIC:**
Pay: RED:2, BLACK:1
Gain: WHITE:1 bonus, board refresh (new Level 1 card drawn)
After: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2 (6 tokens, 4 capacity remaining)

Why this is optimal:
1. **IMMEDIATE TOKEN LIBERATION**: Frees 3 slots (9 → 6 tokens), removing hard capacity barrier
2. **ENABLES FUTURE ACCUMULATION**: With 6 tokens, can take tokens next turn (3 different colors from refreshed board likely available)
3. **BOARD REFRESH TRIGGER**: Replacement Level 1 card drawn, increasing deck diversity on board
4. **PRESTIGE PATH UNBLOCKS**: Extra token capacity allows rapid RED + BLACK accumulation for N5 noble (RED:4, BLACK:4 = 3 prestige instant trigger) or L2_57 (RED:5) completion
5. **WHITE BONUS BONUS**: WHITE:1 bonus supports future nobles (N8, N6 both need WHITE:3) and L3_76 optionality

Why NOT reserve:
- Remain at 10 tokens (still capped, can't take tokens)
- GOLD:1 insufficient to unblock prestige progression (would need to purchase low-prestige card like L1_18 just to free tokens)
- Two-move sequence (reserve → purchase) slower than one move freeing tokens
- Opponent can act twice before board materially improves

Post-action state:
- TOKENS: 6 available capacity
- SCORE: 1 prestige (parity maintained)
- BONUSES: WHITE:1 (new) + GREEN:2 (cumulative)
- Next turn: Take tokens (likely RED:1 + BLACK:1 + WHITE:1 or BLUE:1) to progress toward N5 noble (3 prestige) + L2_57 (2 prestige) = path to 6+ prestige within 3 turns

My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. With my tokens and bonuses (BLUE:1, RED:1), I have BLUE:3, GREEN:3, BLACK:1 - so I just need 2 more BLACK tokens.

Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1

GREEN is 0 on the board, so I can't take it even if needed. I should take WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK:
- BLACK: 1 gets me closer to the 2 needed
- WHITE: 1 gives flexibility for future purchases like L1_28 (needs 1 WHITE) or L2_42 (needs 3 WHITE)
- BLUE: 2 gives flexibility - I can use these for L1_28 (needs 3 BLUE) or save for higher prestige cards

After this action: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2 (9 tokens total, under 10 limit)

Next turn, I'll take another BLACK if available to complete L2_48. If not, I'll continue building resources for other prestige cards like L2_70 (needs 6 RED for 3 prestige) or L1_28 (needs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN for 0 prestige but GREEN bonus).

2026-01-01 12:51:46.829 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with 8 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1). My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. I have BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1 - still need 2 more BLACK.

Board tokens available: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1

I'm at 8 tokens, so taking 3 tokens brings me to 11, meaning I MUST return 1 token. Since GREEN is 0 on the board and I already have enough GREEN (3), I should not take GREEN.

Taking 2 BLACK and 1 RED is optimal because:
- 2 BLACK gets me to BLACK:3, exactly what L2_48 needs
- BLACK is the scarcest resource (only 1 available), so I should grab both
- 1 RED provides flexibility for future purchases like L2_70 (6 RED cost, 3 prestige) or L1_18 (1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK)
- My BLACK bonus from L2_48 will help with higher-level BLACK cards like L2_42

After this action: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:3 = 11 tokens, then return 1 GREEN to get back to 10 tokens. This positions me perfectly to purchase L2_48 next turn if BLACK is still available.

Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

I have 8 tokens, so I can take 2 more without exceeding the 10-token limit. I should take WHITE and BLACK to:
1) Get closer to the 3 BLACK needed for L2_48
2) Keep WHITE available for cards like L1_28 (needs 1 WHITE) or L2_42 (needs 3 WHITE)

With WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens (at max, but that's fine)

Next turn, if BLACK is still available, I'll take more BLACK to complete L2_48. If not, I'll reserve a card strategically.

2026-01-01 12:53:53.256 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 11 CRITICAL RESOURCE ACCUMULATION - SECURE SCARCEST TOKENS & ADVANCE PRESTIGE PATHS

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2 (6 total, 4 capacity remaining)
- Score: 1 prestige (tied 1-1 with opponent)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2 (from L1_31 + L2_60 + L1_21)
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus) - PRIMARY TARGET
- Board: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

**AFFORDABILITY CHECK:**
No cards currently affordable without additional resource accumulation. All Level 1 cards require BLUE (I have BLUE:0). All Level 2+ cards require resource combinations I don't have enough of yet.

**VALID TOKEN MOVE ANALYSIS:**
Board state permits multiple valid 3-token combinations:
1. WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLUE:1 ✓
2. WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 ✓
3. WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + BLACK:1 ✓
4. RED:1 + BLUE:1 + BLACK:1 ✓
(Cannot use same-color rule: only GOLD:5+ qualifies for 2-token same-color move)

**CRITICAL BOTTLENECK - RED SCARCITY:**
Board has only RED:2 remaining, the most constrained resource:
- L2_57 (reserved target): RED:5 cost, need RED:4 more
- L2_56: RED:5 + BLACK:3 cost
- L3_73: RED:6 base cost
- L2_70: RED:6 cost
- N5 noble path: RED:4 + BLACK:4

After this turn and next, board RED will likely be exhausted (2 RED available, can take 1 per turn for 2 turns max). MUST CAPTURE RED NOW.

**PRESTIGE PATH OPTIMIZATION:**
Two viable paths to prestige parity → lead:
1. **L2_57 via GOLD substitution (2 prestige path):**
   - RED:5 cost → Pay with RED:3 tokens + GOLD:2 tokens (gold substitutes as wildcards)
   - Takes 2-3 turns to accumulate RED:3 + GOLD:2
   - Achievable within 3 turns: RED already at 1, accumulate RED:2 + GOLD:2
   - Moves score from 1 → 3 prestige (3-1 lead)

2. **N5 noble path (3 prestige direct trigger):**
   - Requires RED:4 + BLACK:4
   - After taking RED:1 + BLACK:1 this turn → BLACK:3 (satisfied!), RED:2 (need 2 more)
   - Need to accumulate RED:2 more + confirm GOLD availability for wildcards
   - Feasible but requires 1-2 more turns of RED accumulation

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: RED:1 + BLACK:1 + BLUE:1**

Rationale:
1. **RED:1 MANDATORY**: Last RED on board this turn (RED:2 total, RED:1 remains). RED is irreplaceable without deck refresh. Essential for both L2_57 and L3_73 endgame paths.

2. **BLACK:1 CRITICAL**: After taking BLACK:1 → BLACK:3 total = SATISFIES entire BLACK requirement for N5 noble! Now only need RED:2 more to trigger 3 prestige instantly. Or supports L2_56 (RED:5, BLACK:3) if RED accumulation succeeds.

3. **BLUE:1 FLEXIBILITY**: Board has BLUE:2. Taking BLUE:1 maintains color diversity for future valid token moves. Useful for nobles (N8, N6 both need BLUE:3) and supports L2_50 (BLUE bonus reduction) intermediate purchasing.

**CAPACITY CHECK:**
- Current: 6 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens (1 RED, 1 BLACK, 1 BLUE - exactly 3 different colors) ✓
- Board verification: RED:2≥1 ✓, BLACK:1≥1 ✓, BLUE:2≥1 ✓
- Total after: 9 tokens ≤ 10 capacity ✓
- No returns required ✓

**WHY NOT TAKE GOLD TOKENS ON THIS TURN?**
Alternative (RED:1 + BLACK:1 + GOLD:1):
- Would accumulate GOLD:1 toward L2_57 gold-substitution path
- But leaves only BLUE remaining on board, limiting future flexibility
- Taking BLUE now enables backup token moves if board refreshes favorably
- GOLD abundant (5 available); can accumulate GOLD on Turn 13 via same-color rule (GOLD:2 if board still has GOLD:4+)

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3, GOLD:0 (9 total)
- Board after my move: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:5
- Score: 1 prestige (parity maintained)
- Path to L2_57: Turn 12-13 window to accumulate RED:3 + GOLD:2 via token takes / board refreshes
- N5 noble path: RED:2/4 (50% progress), BLACK:3/4 (75% progress), 1-2 turns to completion if RED accumulates

**TURN 11-13 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 12 (opponent): Opponent's action, board potentially refreshes with new card
- Turn 13 (my turn): Assess board; likely accumulate more RED or GOLD tokens; or purchase prestige card if board provides it
- Turn 14+: Pursue L2_57 purchase (2 prestige) or N5 noble (3 prestige) depending on resource availability

**CONCLUSION:**
Capturing RED:1 (critical scarcity bottleneck) + BLACK:1 (completes N5 BLACK requirement) simultaneously while maintaining future token combo flexibility via BLUE. This move positions both L2_57 (2 prestige via GOLD wildcards) and N5 noble (3 prestige instant trigger if RED:2 accumulates) as imminent prestige sources within 2-3 turns, breaking the 1-1 tie and establishing lead.

2026-01-01 12:54:18.331 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with 8 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1). My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLACK tokens (3 needed - 1 current = 2 more needed after bonuses). Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:0. GREEN and BLACK are both 0 on the board, so I can only take WHITE, BLUE, and/or RED. Taking 3 different colors isn't possible. Option 1: take 2 WHITE (only 1 available on board - wait, WHITE shows 1, so I can only take 1 WHITE). Actually, looking more carefully, WHITE shows count of 1, so I can only take 1 WHITE token. Option 2: take 2 BLUE (BLUE shows 1 available, so I can only take 1 BLUE). Wait, I need to check the exact counts again. If WHITE:1 and BLUE:1 are available, I can take at most 1 of each. But that would be taking only 2 tokens total. Let me reconsider. I could also take 2 RED (RED shows 1 available). But actually, looking at the pattern, the available counts suggest there are enough to take 2. Let me take WHITE, BLUE, and RED - but that's 3 tokens total which is more than the available colors would suggest is possible (only 3 different colors available). Actually, I see the issue: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1 = 3 tokens available, so I can take exactly 1 of each. But this only gives me 3 tokens total. A better approach is to take 2 tokens of one color, but BLUE shows 1 available, WHITE shows 1, RED shows 1. None have 2+ available. So I can only take 1 token of each of the 3 available colors, for a total of 3 tokens. This gives me: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1 (11 tokens) - wait, that's 11 which is over 10. I need to be careful. Actually, I have 8 tokens now, taking 3 more would give me 11, which exceeds 10. So I need to either: (1) Return 1 token, or (2) Take fewer tokens. Given my goal of accumulating tokens for L2_48 (needs BLACK) and L2_42 (needs WHITE), and the fact that BLACK is 0 on board, I should prioritize WHITE for L2_42. Since only 1 WHITE is available, I'll take that 1 WHITE token. But wait, taking just 1 token is not a valid action according to the rules. The rules say I must take EXACTLY 3 tokens of 3 different colors OR EXACTLY 2 tokens of the same color. With only 3 colors available at 1 each (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1), I can't take 3 different colors (only 3 available). I can't take 2 of the same color (none have 2+). This is a tricky situation. My options are: (1) Take 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED = 3 tokens, then return 1 (gives me 10 total, wastes a turn), or (2) Reserve a card instead to get a gold token and skip this token mess. Actually, looking at my previous reasoning history, I've been focused on L2_48 which needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. With bonuses, I need 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 2 BLACK. I have 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 BLACK. I need 1 more BLUE and 1 more BLACK. But BLACK is 0 on board. So I can't directly get what I need. Option 1: Reserve a card from deck LEVEL_2 to get a gold token and skip this awkward token situation. This keeps me at 8 tokens and gives me flexibility. Option 2: Take tokens and waste some. Given the awkward situation on the board (not enough of any color to take 2, not enough different colors to take 3), reserving is the cleaner play. I'll reserve from LEVEL_2 deck, hoping to get another card I can use, and get a gold token which gives me flexibility for future purchases. After reserving, I'll have 8 tokens + 1 gold = 9 tokens total, which is a good position to be in for next turn when token supplies may have changed.

2026-01-01 12:54:26.770 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I need 2 more BLACK tokens for L2_48, but BLACK shows 0 on the board. I have tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1.

Looking at visible cards I can afford:
- L1_18: Costs 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK - I have exactly these! Gives WHITE bonus.
- L1_33: Costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK - I have exactly these! Gives RED bonus.

L1_18 is optimal because:
1) I already have a RED bonus from L1_40, so RED bonus from L1_33 would be redundant
2) WHITE bonus helps with future purchases like L2_42 (needs 3 WHITE) and L3_76 (needs 7 WHITE)
3) Uses all my tokens efficiently (no waste)
4) Reduces token count from 8 to 4, keeping me under 10 limit

After purchase: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0 (4 tokens) with bonuses BLUE:1, RED:1, WHITE:1.

2026-01-01 12:56:10.451 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 12 CRITICAL JUNCTURE: BREAK TOKEN FREEZE & SECURE PRESTIGE LEAD

**CURRENT BOTTLENECK:**
- Tokens: 9 out of 10 capacity (at hard ceiling)
- Score: 1 prestige (TIED 1-1 with opponent)
- Movement blocked: Cannot take 3 different colors (only WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 available—need 3+ distinct colors). Same-color rule (GOLD:2) insufficient to escape freeze (10-token state persists).
- Token pressure: I cannot accumulate resources to afford expensive prestige cards (L2_57, L2_56, L3_73) while frozen at capacity.

**UNIQUE AFFORDABILITY WINDOW: L2_42**

L2_42 card requirements:
- Base cost: WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLACK:2 → 1 prestige, BLACK bonus
- My active bonuses: WHITE:1 (from L1_21), GREEN:2 (from L1_31 + L2_60)
- Cost reduction: WHITE:3 - 1 = WHITE:2, GREEN:3 - 2 = GREEN:1, BLACK:2 - 0 = BLACK:2
- **Effective cost: WHITE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:2**
- My available tokens: WHITE:2✓, GREEN:1✓, BLACK:3✓
- **STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE THIS TURN**

**WHY PURCHASE L2_42 NOW:**

1. **IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE GAIN (Score breakout):**
   - Current: 1 prestige
   - After purchase: 1 + 1 = 2 prestige
   - Opponent: 1 prestige
   - **RESULT: I take the lead (2-1) for the first time in game**
   - Prestige parity was the critical stalemate; now I have momentum.

2. **TOKEN LIBERATION (Unlock accumulation):**
   - Current tokens: 9 total (9/10 capacity)
   - Spending: 5 tokens (WHITE:2 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:2)
   - After purchase: 4 tokens (4/10 capacity)
   - **Freed slots: 6 available for next turn's accumulation**
   - From frozen → liberated; can take tokens freely next turn

3. **CUMULATIVE BONUS ACCELERATION:**
   - Gain: BLACK:1 bonus (from L2_42)
   - New bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
   - Future impact: Enables cheaper BLACK-heavy cards
     - L2_50 (BLACK:4 → BLACK:3 with BLACK:1 bonus) becomes 1 token closer
     - L3_73 (BLACK:3 → BLACK:2 with BLACK:1 bonus, RED:6 discounted further by future bonuses) becomes more achievable
     - N5 noble (BLACK:4 → BLACK:3 with BLACK:1 bonus) requirements ease

4. **BOARD REFRESH TRIGGER:**
   - Purchasing L2_42 replaces it with new Level 2 card from deck
   - Increases card diversity and strategic optionality
   - May expose better prestige targets for future purchasing

**ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS (why NOT these moves?):**

- **TAKE_TOKENS (3 colors):** Current 9 + taking 3 = 12 → must return 2 = 10 total (STILL FROZEN). Wasted turn.
- **TAKE_TOKENS (GOLD:2):** Current 9 + taking 2 = 11 → must return 1 = 10 total (STILL FROZEN, no prestige, wasted turn).
- **RESERVE_CARD:** Gain GOLD:1 token, but stay at 10 tokens + board space (frozen). GOLD:1 insufficient for L2_57 (need GOLD:3 to supplement RED:2 for RED:5 cost). Prestige delayed 2+ turns.
- **PURCHASE L1_33 (0 prestige):** Frees tokens but zero prestige gain (can't afford this now and wastes opportunity). L2_42 is prestige-generating (same token cost, more strategic value).

**POST-PURCHASE STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (4/10 capacity)
- Score: 2 prestige (lead over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1 (cumulative)
- Purchased cards: 4 total (L1_31, L2_60, L1_21, L2_42)
- Prestige path unlocked: Next turn can take RED:1 + BLACK:1 + remaining colors → progress toward N5 noble (RED:4, BLACK:4 → 3 prestige instant trigger) or L2_57 (RED:5 → 2 prestige via GOLD substitution)

**TURN 13+ ROADMAP:**
- Turn 13 (opponent acts): They likely take tokens toward L2_48 or other goals.
- Turn 14 (my turn): With 6 freed slots, take multiple tokens (e.g., RED:1 + BLACK:1 + GREEN:1) → Position toward N5 noble completion within 2 turns.
- Turn 15+: Trigger N5 noble (3 prestige) + purchase additional prestige cards (L2_57 via GOLD accumulation) → Expand lead to 5-8+ prestige, dominate final prestige race.

**CONCLUSION:** L2_42 is the PIVOT POINT—the ONLY prestige-generating card currently affordable that simultaneously breaks the token freeze and takes the prestige lead. This is the critical decision that transitions me from starvation to acceleration. Purchase immediately.

2026-01-01 12:56:33.118 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0 (5 total). My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. After bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1), I still need: 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. I have 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 BLACK. I need 2 more BLACK and 2 more GREEN.

Available tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:3

With 5 tokens, I can take up to 5 tokens. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK is optimal because:
- 1 GREEN gets me closer to the 3 GREEN needed
- 1 BLACK starts my collection toward the 3 BLACK needed
- The WHITE gives me flexibility for future purchases

After this action: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 (8 tokens)

Next turn, I'll take GREEN and BLACK tokens to complete L2_48 requirements. L2_48's BLUE bonus will help with future Level 2 purchases like L2_50 (2 prestige, BLUE bonus). I'm staying under 10 tokens and making efficient progress toward my reserved card.

2026-01-01 12:58:23.108 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 13 CRITICAL DECISION - PROGRESS TOWARD NOBLE TRIGGER & SECURE SCARCE RESOURCES

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (4 total, 6 capacity remaining)
- Score: 2 prestige (LEADING 2-1, first time with advantage)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:5

**OPPONENT STATUS:**
- Score: 1 prestige
- Tokens: 8/10 capacity (2 slots only)
- Reserved: L2_48 (BLUE:2✓, GREEN:3✓, BLACK:3 - needs BLACK:2 more, currently has BLACK:1)
- Opponent CANNOT purchase L2_48 this turn (frozen at capacity, needs multiple token takes to accumulate BLACK:2 + maintain other resources)

**PRESTIGE PATH ANALYSIS:**

Two viable high-value prestige targets:

1. **L2_57 PATH (2 prestige):**
   - Cost: RED:5 (my RED:2 + GOLD:3 substitution)
   - Timeline: 2-3 turns (need to accumulate GOLD:3)
   - Process: Requires RED accumulation + GOLD token takes OR reserve sequence

2. **N5 NOBLE PATH (3 prestige instant trigger) - OPTIMAL:**
   - Requirement: RED:4, BLACK:4
   - Current progress: RED:2, BLACK:1 (BOTH at ~50%)
   - After taking RED:1 + BLACK:1: RED:3, BLACK:2 (need RED:1, BLACK:2 more = ONLY 3 tokens away!)
   - Timeline: 2 turns to completion
   - Value: 3 prestige (vs. L2_57's 2 prestige) + moves me to 5 prestige total

**CRITICAL BOTTLENECK: RED:1 LAST ON BOARD**
Board has RED:1 remaining. This is the game's most constrained resource:
- Essential for L2_57 (RED:5 cost)
- Essential for N5 noble (RED:4 requirement)
- Essential for L3_73 endgame (RED:6 cost)
- If I don't capture it now, opponent could take it, or it's wasted

MUSTake RED:1 this turn to maintain prestige path optionality.

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: RED:1 + BLUE:1 + BLACK:1**

**Rationale:**

1. **CAPTURE CRITICAL RED (1 token remaining):**
   - Only RED:1 available on entire board after this turn
   - Irreplaceable without card-purchase deck refresh
   - After taking: RED:3 total (need RED:1 more for N5 noble)

2. **ADVANCE BLACK ACCUMULATION TOWARD N5 NOBLE (FASTEST PATH TO 3 PRESTIGE):**
   - After taking: BLACK:2 total
   - N5 noble requires RED:4 + BLACK:4
   - Only need RED:1 + BLACK:2 more = achievable within 2 turns
   - This triggers 3 prestige instantly (5 prestige total)
   - Faster than L2_57 route (2 prestige in 3 turns)

3. **MAINTAIN TOKEN FLEXIBILITY:**
   - Current: 4 tokens
   - After: 7 tokens (3 capacity remaining)
   - Can still take 3-token moves on future turns
   - No forced returns or constraints

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- RED:1 on board ≥ 1 ✓
- BLUE:1 on board ≥ 1 ✓
- BLACK:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
- Exactly 3 different colors ✓
- Total after: 7 ≤ 10 capacity ✓
- No returns required ✓

**OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:**
Opponent frozen at 8 tokens with only 2 capacity slots. To purchase L2_48, opponent needs:
- BLUE:2 (has) ✓
- GREEN:3 (has only 2, needs 1 more)
- BLACK:3 (has only 1, needs 2 more)

Even if opponent takes optimal GREEN:1 + BLACK:1 combo, they'd still need BLACK:1 more and lack capacity for full resupply. NO IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE THREAT THIS TURN.

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (7 total)
- Score: 2 prestige (lead increased via parity maintenance)
- N5 Noble Progress: RED:3/4 (75%), BLACK:2/4 (50%)
- Prestige timeline: N5 achievable within 2 turns → 5 prestige (2-turn lead over opponent)

**TURN 14-15 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 14 (opponent acts): Likely pursue token accumulation or purchase low-value card to free capacity
- Turn 15 (my turn): Take RED:1 (if board has it after refresh) + BLACK:1 + other color → RED:4, BLACK:3 (1 BLACK short)
- Turn 16: Accumulate BLACK:1 more → Trigger N5 noble (3 prestige) → Move to 5 prestige, establish 4-point lead
- Turn 17+: Pursue L2_57 (2 more prestige) or other prestige cards to reach 15-point victory

**WHY NOT L2_57 DIRECT PATH?**
- Requires RED:2 + GOLD:3 substitution = 3-turn accumulation (reserve + GOLD:2 take)
- Only yields 2 prestige
- N5 noble yields 3 prestige in 2 turns (faster, better value)
- Both paths converge at ~5-6 prestige within 3 turns; N5 first gives momentum advantage

**CONCLUSION:** Capturing RED:1 (critical scarcity) + BLACK:1 (N5 requirement) positions me for 3 prestige via noble trigger within 2 turns, expanding my lead from 2-1 to 5-1 while locking in prestige momentum before opponent can reestablish competitiveness.

2026-01-01 12:58:37.839 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1. My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK = 8 total cost. After bonuses, I need: 0 more BLUE (I have 2, bonus covers 1), 1 more GREEN (have 2), 2 more BLACK (have 1). But BLACK and GREEN are 0 on the board, so I can't take tokens. Instead, I'll reserve L2_70 (6 RED cost, 3 prestige, RED bonus). This gives me a gold token which helps with future purchases. With my current token count of 8, taking this action keeps me at 8 tokens. After this, I'll focus on taking GREEN and BLACK tokens as they become available on the board. L2_70 is valuable at 3 prestige points and the RED bonus helps with other RED-heavy cards like L2_56 (5 RED, 3 BLACK).

2026-01-01 13:00:22.232 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 14 PRESTIGE CONSOLIDATION & STRATEGIC WILDCARD ACCUMULATION

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (7/10 capacity, 3 slots free)
- Score: 2 prestige (LEADING 2-1 over opponent)
- Board: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:4 (RED CRITICALLY DEPLETED)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5 cost, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus) — IMMEDIATELY PURCHASABLE WITH GOLD WILDCARDS

**CRITICAL BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS:**
RED tokens on board have reached 0. This creates a **strategic fork**:
- **N5 Noble Path (BLOCKED)**: Requires RED:4 + BLACK:4 total. I have RED:3 + BLACK:2. Cannot accumulate RED:1 more without board refresh (triggered by card purchase). Path is stalled for 2+ turns.
- **L2_57 Direct Path (VIABLE)**: Reserved card costs RED:5. I have RED:3 tokens. GOLD tokens are wildcards in Splendor—gold can substitute for any gem color. With GOLD:2, I can pay: RED:3 (gems) + GOLD:2 (wildcards) = covers RED:5 cost. **L2_57 is purchasable NEXT TURN.**

**PRESTIGE OUTCOME COMPARISON:**
1. **L2_57 Route (Optimal):**
   - Turn 14 (now): Take GOLD:2 → Tokens become WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (9/10)
   - Turn 15 (next): Purchase L2_57 → Spend RED:3 + GOLD:2 → Gain 2 prestige + WHITE bonus
   - Score progression: 2 → 4 prestige (3-point lead, 4-1)
   - Velocity: 2 prestige gain in 2 turns

2. **N5 Noble Route (Blocked):**
   - Requires multiple board token takes since RED:0
   - Timeline: 2-3 turns minimum to accumulate RED:1 + BLACK:2 more
   - Even if triggered: 3 prestige, but slower arrival

**L2_57 is strictly faster and guaranteed.**

**AFFORDABILITY CHECK - NO OTHER PRESTIGE CARDS PURCHASABLE THIS TURN:**
Verified all face-up cards:
- L2_56 (2 prestige): Needs RED:5, BLACK:2 after bonuses. I have RED:3, BLACK:2. Short RED:2. ✗
- L2_50 (2 prestige): Needs WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 after bonuses. I have WHITE:0. ✗
- L2_45 (2 prestige): Needs WHITE:4 after bonuses. I have WHITE:0. ✗
- L2_65 (1 prestige): Needs WHITE:1, RED:2, BLACK:2 after bonuses. I have WHITE:0. ✗
- All Level 3 cards: Require 6-7+ gems each. Completely unaffordable. ✗
- Level 1 cards: Give 0 prestige (no strategic prestige gain). ✗

**THE MOVE: TAKE_TOKENS (GOLD:2)**

**Rationale:**

1. **Wildcard Accumulation (L2_57 Enabler):**
   - L2_57 is my reserved card, available to purchase without board exposure
   - Cost: RED:5 (single color requirement)
   - My tokens: RED:3
   - GOLD substitution: RED:3 + GOLD:2 = RED:5 equivalence ✓
   - Taking GOLD:2 now ensures L2_57 purchase viability next turn

2. **Prestige Breakout (2-1 → 4-1 Dominance):**
   - Current score: 2 prestige
   - Post-L2_57 (Turn 15): 4 prestige
   - Opponent score: 1 prestige
   - **Gap expansion: 3-point lead (insurmountable in midgame)**
   - Opponent's L2_70 (3 prestige, RED:6 cost) is permanently blocked by board RED:0 depletion

3. **Token Flexibility (Avoid Cap Trap):**
   - Current: 7 tokens (3 slots free)
   - Taking GOLD:2 (same-color rule): 7 + 2 = 9 tokens (1 slot remains free)
   - Alternative (e.g., WHITE:1 + BLACK:1 + GREEN:1 = 3 colors): 7 + 3 = 10 (CAPPED, frozen)
   - **Staying at 9 avoids token-cap trap** that plagued Turn 12; maintains future token-taking optionality

4. **Board Rule Compliance (Valid Same-Color Move):**
   - GOLD on board: 4 available
   - Taking GOLD:2: 4 ≥ 2 ✓ (same-color rule requires 4+ on board)
   - Current 7 + taking 2 = 9 total ≤ 10 capacity ✓
   - No return tokens needed ✓
   - This is the ONLY same-color option (BLUE:0, RED:0, other colors insufficient)

5. **Opponent Bottleneck (No Counter-Threat):**
   - Opponent at 9/10 tokens (essentially capped at capacity)
   - Opponent reserved L2_70 (RED:6 cost): Impossible without Red board availability
   - Opponent reserved L2_48 (BLUE:2✓, GREEN:3✓, BLACK:3): Missing BLACK:2 more, cannot accumulate while over-capacity
   - **Opponent cannot generate immediate prestige threat; this turn is a "free" prestige setup move**

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (9/10)
- Score: 2 prestige (prestige +1 delayed to Turn 15 via L2_57)
- Board: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (after this take)

**TURN 15 EXECUTION (FOLLOW-UP):**
- Action: Purchase L2_57
- Payment: RED:3 (tokens) + GOLD:2 (wildcards) = RED:5 cost satisfied
- Gain: 2 prestige points, WHITE bonus (1st card giving WHITE bonus; cumulative with L1_21)
- New state: 4 prestige total, opponent at 1 prestige (3-point lead secured)

**VICTORY TRAJECTORY:**
- Turn 15: 4-1 prestige (opponent cannot catch up; L2_70 blocked by RED:0)
- Turns 16-18: With freed token slots after L2_57 purchase, accumulate toward N8 noble (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3—now feasible with WHITE:2 cumulative bonus) or reserve L3_73 (4 prestige, RED heavy but post-accumulation viable)
- Target: 7-8 prestige by Turn 18, 15 prestige by Turn 22

**CONCLUSION:**
GOLD:2 take is the **linchpin resource consolidation move** enabling L2_57 purchase next turn. This converts a narrow 2-1 prestige lead into an irreversible 4-1 dynasty while preserving token flexibility and exploiting opponent's capacity bottleneck. With opponent unable to access L2_70's 3 prestige (RED board depleted), I establish insurmountable prestige momentum before final accumulation phase.

2026-01-01 13:01:49.098 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 14: SECURE PRESTIGE EDGE VIA L2_57 PURCHASE SETUP

CURRENT STATE:
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (7 total, 3 capacity)
- My score: 2 prestige (LEADING 2-1 for first time)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
- My reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus) - NEXT PRESTIGE TARGET
- Opponent: 1 prestige (frozen at 9 tokens, unable to make prestige progress)

CRITICAL BOTTLENECK SHIFT:
- Board RED DEPLETED (RED:0) - N5 noble path (RED:4, BLACK:4) is now BLOCKED
  - I have RED:3, BLACK:2; need RED:1 more but board has zero RED
  - Cannot progress this path until board refreshes via card purchase
- Board BLUE DEPLETED (BLUE:0)
- GOLD abundant (GOLD:4 available)

L2_57 RESERVED CARD PATH (OPTIMAL & ONLY VIABLE):
L2_57 cost: RED:5 → 2 prestige + WHITE:1 bonus
- My current resources: RED:3
- Deficit: RED:2 (can substitute with GOLD:2 tokens)
- Action sequence:
  1. THIS TURN (14): Take GOLD:2 from board
  2. NEXT TURN (15): Purchase L2_57 by paying RED:3 + GOLD:2
  3. Result: +2 prestige (2 → 4), new cumulative bonuses (WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:1)

WHY TAKE_TOKENS (GOLD:2) NOW:
1. **PREPARES PRESTIGE PURCHASE**: Accumulates exact resource needed for L2_57 purchase next turn
2. **SAFEGUARDS CAPACITY**: After taking GOLD:2, I'll have 9 tokens (1 capacity remaining)
   - Avoids capacity freeze (9 is playable, 10 creates hard freeze)
   - Next turn after purchase: 9 - 5 = 4 tokens (full recovery to low capacity state)
3. **ACCELERATES LEAD**: L2_57 purchase (2 prestige) moves score from 2 → 4
   - Opponent stuck at 1 prestige, unable to escape token deadlock
   - Creates 4-1 prestige lead, virtually insurmountable
4. **BOARD AVAILABILITY**: GOLD:4 on board ≥ 2 required ✓
   - Valid move under same-color rule (2 tokens when 4+ available) ✓

WHY NOT ALTERNATIVE MOVES:
- Alternative: Take WHITE:1 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:1
  - Advances BLACK: 2 → 3 (N5 needs 4, locked at 10 capacity)
  - NO prestige progress (wasted turn vs. GOLD setup)
  - Freezes capacity again, prevents future flexibility
  
- Cannot purchase anything NOW (no card affordable with current exact tokens)
- Cannot reserve (delays prestige by requiring additional turns)
- Cannot proceed with N5 noble (blocked by RED:0 board depletion)

VERIFICATION:
- Current tokens: 7
- Taking: GOLD:2 (same color, 4+ available on board) ✓
- Total after: 9 ≤ 10 capacity ✓
- No returns needed ✓

POST-ACTION STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (9 total)
- Score: 2 prestige (parity maintained)
- LOCKED & LOADED: L2_57 purchase guaranteed next turn

OPPONENT ANALYSIS:
- Opponent at 9/10 tokens (2 capacity only)
- Opponent reserved: L2_48 (can purchase IF they get BLACK:3 total - currently has BLACK:1)
- Opponent reserved: L2_70 (RED:6 cost - opponent has RED:1, blocked)
- Opponent cannot escape token deadlock in time to match my prestige acceleration

CONCLUSION: Taking GOLD:2 is the PIVOT that transforms a narrow 2-1 lead into a commanding 4-1 domination next turn. This move secures the prestige path when the opponent is frozen, ensuring victory trajectory.

2026-01-01 13:02:51.827 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 14 TOKEN ACCUMULATION - CRITICAL SETUP FOR L2_57 PURCHASE & RED REGENERATION

CURRENT STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (7 total, 3 capacity remaining)
- Score: 2 prestige (LEADING 2-1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:
N5 noble path blocked temporarily:
- N5 requirement: RED:4, BLACK:4
- Current progress: RED:3/4, BLACK:2/4
- Board RED:0 (completely depleted - unavailable for token take)
- Can only advance if board refreshes with new RED tokens

OPTION A - Take WHITE/GREEN/BLACK (NOT VIABLE):
- Take WHITE:1 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:1 → 10 tokens (FROZEN AT CAPACITY)
- BLACK:3/4 progress, but trapped, cannot take tokens next turn
- Forces reserve/purchase just to free slots (inefficient)

OPTION B - Take GOLD:2 (OPTIMAL - SAME-COLOR RULE):
- Board has GOLD:4 available ≥ 4 threshold for same-color rule ✓
- Take exactly 2 tokens of same color (GOLD:2) ✓
- Current: 7 tokens + taking 2 = 9 total ≤ 10 capacity ✓
- No returns needed ✓

WHY TAKE GOLD NOW:

1. **ENABLES L2_57 PURCHASE NEXT TURN:**
   - L2_57 cost: RED:5 (I have RED:3 available)
   - Substitution: GOLD tokens act as wildcards for any color
   - With GOLD:2 + RED:3 = RED:5 cost fully covered ✓
   - Next turn: PURCHASE L2_57 → +2 prestige (4 total)

2. **RED TOKEN REGENERATION MECHANISM:**
   - Purchasing L2_57 costs RED:5 (5 red tokens must be paid)
   - These RED:3 tokens I spend RETURN to board reserve after purchase
   - POST-PURCHASE BOARD STATE: RED:3-4 available again (depends on opponent spending)
   - Opens N5 noble path again for Turns 16-18

3. **TOKEN SLOT LIBERATION:**
   - After L2_57 purchase: RED:3 spent, GOLD:2 spent → freed 5 slots
   - Remaining tokens after purchase: BLUE:2, BLACK:2 (4 total)
   - New capacity: 6 slots available for Turn 16 accumulation phase

4. **PRESTIGE ACCELERATION:**
   - Turn 14: Take GOLD:2 (9 tokens, parity maintenance)
   - Turn 15: Purchase L2_57 (+2 prestige → 4 total, back to 4 tokens)
   - Turn 16: Accumulate RED:1 + BLACK:1 + GREEN:1 → Reset N5 requirements
   - Turn 17: Accumulate BLACK:1 + other color → Complete N5 noble (+3 prestige → 7 total)
   - Result: 5-point prestige lead over opponent by Turn 17

OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Opponent is frozen at 8/10 capacity with:
- Reserved: L2_48 (BLUE:2✓, GREEN:3✓ but needs BLACK:3, has BLACK:1)
- Reserved: L2_70 (RED:6, needs 3 turns to accumulate)
- Unlikely to purchase before Turn 16 (capacity-constrained)
- No immediate prestige threat (stuck at 1 prestige)

POST-ACTION STATE (End of Turn 14):
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (9 total)
- Board after: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 remaining
- Score: 2 prestige (maintained)
- Next move: Purchase L2_57 on Turn 15

CONCLUSION: GOLD:2 acquisition sets up a two-turn prestige sprint (Turn 15 L2_57 +2, Turn 17 N5 +3 = +5 prestige swing) while regenerating RED tokens via the purchase mechanic. This locks in a 5-point prestige lead by mid-game, making opponent's catch-up mathematically impossible.

Board shows BLUE:0, RED:0, so I can only take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (1 each, 3 different colors). This gets me to 10 tokens exactly, with 1 GREEN and 1 BLACK toward my L2_48 requirements. Next turn I'll use gold to buy L1_28 (1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN) which I'm now exactly set up for after taking these tokens.

Taking only 2 tokens doesn't meet the action requirements, so I should RESERVE a card instead.

L2_70 is a 3 prestige point card (RED bonus, 6 RED cost) that's visible on the board. By reserving it, I:
1) Get a gold token (helps with future purchases of expensive cards)
2) Prevent opponent from taking it
3) Work toward a high-value prestige card

After this action: 9 tokens total (8 + 1 gold). I'll focus on taking GREEN and BLACK tokens next to complete L2_48 requirements.

2026-01-01 13:03:43.906 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1). My reserved cards are L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK) and L2_70 (needs 6 RED, 3 prestige).

I analyzed all options:
- Taking tokens: I have 9 tokens, so I can take at most 1 token before hitting the 10-token limit. The available tokens are WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:1. I could take 1 WHITE, but that wouldn't significantly advance my goals.
- Purchasing visible cards: L1_33 costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK. With my bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1), I effectively need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK. I have all of these!
- L1_33 gives a RED bonus, which directly contributes to my L2_70 (needs 6 RED).

L1_33 is optimal because:
1) Uses exactly 1 GREEN and 1 BLACK token (which I have excess of)
2) Leaves me with 7 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0), well under the 10 limit
3) Gives me a RED bonus (my 2nd RED bonus), getting me closer to L2_70's 6 RED requirement
4) The other colors (WHITE, BLUE) are preserved for future flexibility

After purchase: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (7 tokens total) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:2.

2026-01-01 13:03:43.906 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
2026-01-01 13:06:10.609 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 15 CRITICAL ANALYSIS: SECURE PRESTIGE LEAD & COMPLETE L2_57 PURCHASE SEQUENCE

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (7 total, 3 capacity remaining)
- Score: 2 prestige (LEADING 2-1 vs opponent 1 prestige)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus) - PRIMARY TARGET
- Purchased cards: L1_31, L2_60, L1_21, L2_42 (4 cards)

**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**
Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:4
- **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: RED:0 on board** - This is a bottleneck that blocks traditional RED accumulation
- However, GOLD:4 is abundant (most plentiful resource on board)
- BLUE:0 eliminates noble triggers N6, N8 (both require BLUE:3)
- N5 (RED:4 + BLACK:4) is blocked because RED:0 prevents RED:4 accumulation

**PRESTIGE PATH BREAKTHROUGH:**
My reserved L2_57 costs RED:5 prestige. With 3 RED tokens, I need 2 more RED. But RED:0 on board makes direct token accumulation impossible.

**SOLUTION: GOLD WILDCARD SUBSTITUTION**
Splendor rules allow GOLD tokens to substitute as wildcards for any required token color.
- L2_57 cost: RED:5
- My payment capability: RED:3 (in hand) + GOLD:2 (if obtained) = RED:3 + RED:2 (via GOLD wildcards) = RED:5 ✓
- **This solves the RED bottleneck without relying on board RED availability**

**OPTIMAL MOVE: TAKE_TOKENS GOLD:2**
Board availability: GOLD:4 on board
Token rule: "Take EXACTLY 2 tokens of SAME color if 4+ available on board"
Validation:
- Board GOLD count: 4 ≥ 4 ✓
- Taking exactly 2 of same color ✓
- Current tokens: 7
- After take: 7 + 2 = 9 ≤ 10 capacity ✓
- No returns needed ✓

**POST-ACTION STATE (This Turn):**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (9 total)
- Score: 2 prestige (still leading)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1 (unchanged)
- Critical setup: Next turn, L2_57 becomes affordable via RED:3 + GOLD:2 payment

**TURN 16 PLANNED SEQUENCE:**
- Action: PURCHASE_CARD L2_57
- Payment: RED:3 + GOLD:2 (GOLD substitutes for RED:2 needed)
- Gain: 2 prestige (2 → 4 total)
- Gain: WHITE:1 bonus (WHITE:1 → WHITE:2 cumulative)
- New tokens after: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:0 (4 total, 6 slots freed)
- **Score becomes 4 prestige vs opponent 1 prestige = DOMINANT 4-point lead**

**LONG-TERM IMPACT:**
1. **Immediate prestige gain (2 → 4 total) defeats all prestige competition**: Opponent score stuck at 1 prestige for now. They cannot close 3-point gap in immediate turns.

2. **Enable subsequent noble triggers**: With WHITE:2 bonus, I'm now closer to:
   - N6 (BLACK:3 + WHITE:3 + BLUE:3) - need WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 more
   - N8 (WHITE:3 + BLUE:3 + GREEN:3) - need WHITE:1 + BLUE:3 more
   - If board refreshes with new BLUE and WHITE tokens after L2_57 purchase, I can accumulate toward N6 (3 prestige) within 2-3 turns
   - Path to 7 prestige (4 + 3 from N6) very achievable

3. **Board refresh trigger**: Purchasing L2_57 removes it from board and draws a new Level 2 card. This might introduce new token-generation opportunities or prestige cards.

**WHY THIS IS OPTIMAL (vs alternatives):**
- **TAKE gems (WHITE:1 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:1)**: Would hit 10 token capacity, lock myself into forced purchase next turn, no prestige gain this turn, delays L2_57
- **RESERVE_CARD**: Gets GOLD:1 (not enough for L2_57 which needs GOLD:2), delays prestige accumulation, wastes turn
- **PURCHASE L1_1 now**: Uses tokens inefficiently (small 0-prestige card), doesn't set up L2_57
- **TAKE_TOKENS GOLD:2**: Directly enables L2_57 next turn (2 prestige guaranted), maintains prestige lead, frees board space for future accumulation

**CONCLUSION:**
GOLD:2 acquisition is the linchpin move that transforms my lead from 2-1 to imminent 4-1 via L2_57 purchase next turn. This locks in prestige advantage and positions me to trigger high-value nobles (N6 = 3 prestige) within 2-3 additional turns, advancing toward 15-prestige victory condition.

2026-01-01 13:08:15.193 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 15 CRITICAL DECISION - CONTINUE N5 NOBLE PATH DESPITE RED SCARCITY

CURRENT STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2 (7 total, 3 capacity remaining)
- Score: 2 prestige (LEADING 2-1 vs. opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5 cost, 2 prestige) - NOT YET AFFORDABLE (need RED:2 more)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:4

CRITICAL BOTTLENECK SHIFT:
RED:0 on board indicates RED has been consumed (either by opponent or via earlier takes). This is a MAJOR development:
- My L2_57 path (RED:5 cost) now blocked without GOLD substitution
- Opponent's L2_70 (RED:6 cost, 3 prestige—a reserved threat!) also blocked
- Both players equally constrained by RED scarcity
- ADVANTAGE: Opponent cannot rapidly close prestige gap via L2_70 purchase

AFFORDABILITY ASSESSMENT:
With board tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, RED:0, BLACK:2), valid 3-color combos are LIMITED:
- WHITE:1 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:1 ✓ (ONLY valid 3-color option)
- Cannot use same-color rule (no color ≥ 4 available)
- Cannot take just BLUE or RED (unavailable)

OPTIMAL MOVE: WHITE:1 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:1

Rationale:
1. **REMAIN ON N5 NOBLE TRAJECTORY**:
   - Current: RED:3/4 (75%), BLACK:2/4 (50%)
   - After taking: RED:3/4 (75%), BLACK:3/4 (75%)
   - Only 2 tokens total away from triggering 3 prestige instantly
   - This is achievable within 2 turns if board refreshes with RED

2. **DEFEND PRESTIGE LEAD**:
   - Playing offense (taking tokens toward N5) is safer than defensive stalls
   - Opponent stuck on L2_70 (RED scarcity), so I have window to execute
   - If I idle without progressing, opponent may find alternative prestige path

3. **PREPARE TURN 16 PURCHASE PIVOT**:
   - After taking, I'll be at 10 tokens (exactly at capacity)
   - L1_1 is affordable (BLUE:1, RED:1 cost, effective) and available on board
   - Purchasing L1_1 triggers: FREE tokens (10→8), gain BLACK:1 bonus (BLACK:2 total), and critically BLACK:1 card prestige → BLACK:4 SATISFIED for N5
   - This liberates 2 token slots for Turn 17 accumulation

4. **TURN 17 ENDGAME SETUP**:
   - After Turn 16 purchase (L1_1): WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:4 (8 tokens, 2 slots free)
   - Turn 17: Board likely refreshed by opponent/purchases, RED may reappear
   - If RED:1+ available on Turn 17 board: Take RED:1 + other color + other color → RED:3 + (any) → TRIGGERS N5 NOBLE IMMEDIATELY (RED:3/4 still, but BLACK:4 ✓) 
   - Wait, N5 requires BOTH RED:4 AND BLACK:4 simultaneously. After Turn 16 I'd have BLACK:4 but RED:2. Still need RED:2 more.
   - Revised: N5 trigger comes Turn 18-19 after accumulating RED:4 via future takes

5. **BOARD VERIFICATION**:
   - WHITE:2 ≥ 1 ✓
   - GREEN:3 ≥ 1 ✓
   - BLACK:2 ≥ 1 ✓
   - Exactly 3 different colors ✓
   - Capacity: 7 current + 3 taking = 10 total ≤ 10 limit ✓
   - No token returns required ✓

POST-ACTION STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3 (10 total, at capacity)
- N5 Noble progress: RED:3/4, BLACK:3/4 (50% toward trigger: both need 1 more token each)
- Score: 2 prestige (parity maintained vs. opponent's 1)
- Turn 16 setup: Can purchase L1_1 to get BLACK:4 satisfied + free tokens

CONCLUSION: Secure BLACK progression and maintain capacity at threshold. This positions N5 noble (3 prestige) and subsequent prestige sources (L2_57 via GOLD accumulation pathway, or other cards) as imminent, expanding the lead from 2-1 to 5-1+ within 3-4 turns.

2026-01-01 13:08:27.705 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 7 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:1) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:2. My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. After bonuses, I need: 0 BLUE (have 2, bonus covers), 2 GREEN (have 1, need 2 more), 3 BLACK (have 0, need 3 more). Available tokens on board: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:4.

Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK (3 different colors) is optimal because:
- 1 GREEN gets me closer to the 2 GREEN I need for L2_48
- 1 BLACK starts my collection toward the 3 BLACK I need for L2_48
- 1 WHITE gives me flexibility for future purchases like L1_28 (needs 1 WHITE) or L2_45 (needs 5 WHITE)

After taking: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (10 tokens total). Since I'm at 10 tokens, I must return 1 WHITE to stay under the limit.

Final state: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (7 tokens). This positions me to take more BLACK and GREEN tokens next turn to complete L2_48.

2026-01-01 13:09:45.353 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 16 CRITICAL DECISION - BREAK CAPACITY FREEZE & EXTEND PRESTIGE LEAD

**CURRENT BOTTLENECK:**
- Tokens: 10/10 (FULL CAPACITY - frozen)
- Score: 2 prestige (leading 2-1 vs opponent 1)
- N5 Noble Path: RED:3/4, BLACK:3/4 (only 2 tokens away from 3-prestige trigger!)
- Board tokens available: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:4

**TOKEN TAKING ANALYSIS:**
At 10/10 capacity, I cannot escape via token taking:
- Option 1 (3 colors): WHITE:1 + GREEN:1 + GOLD:1 → Take 3, MUST return 3 = FROZEN
- Option 2 (GOLD:2 same-color): Take 2, MUST return 1 = FROZEN

All token moves result in capacity lock. PURCHASING IS MANDATORY.

**AFFORDABLE CARD EVALUATION:**

1. L1_7: Cost GREEN:3 - GREEN:2 bonus = GREEN:1 effective
   - Frees: 1 token | Prestige: 0 ✗ (low value)

2. L1_1: Cost BLUE:1 + GREEN:1 + WHITE:1 + RED:1 - (WHITE:1 + GREEN:2 bonuses) = BLUE:1 + RED:1 effective
   - Frees: 2 tokens | Prestige: 0 ✗ (low value)

3. **L2_65: Cost WHITE:2 + RED:2 + BLACK:3 - (WHITE:1 + BLACK:1 bonuses) = WHITE:1 + RED:2 + BLACK:2 effective**
   - Requirements met: WHITE:1✓, RED:2 (have 3)✓, BLACK:2 (have 3)✓
   - **STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓
   - Frees: 5 tokens (10→5) | Prestige: 1 | Bonus: RED:1

**L2_65 IS THE DOMINATING PLAY:**

**Mathematical verification:**
- My bonuses: WHITE:1 (L1_21), GREEN:2 (L1_31+L2_60), BLACK:1 (L2_42)
- L2_65 base cost: WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3
- Effective cost after bonuses: WHITE:2-1=1, RED:2-0=2, BLACK:3-1=2
- My tokens: WHITE:1✓, RED:3✓, BLACK:3✓
- Tokens after: WHITE:0, RED:1, BLACK:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1 (5 total, 5 freed)

**Strategic Impact:**

1. **CAPACITY LIBERATION (CRITICAL):**
   - Frees 5 token slots → Capacity now 5/10
   - Next turn: Can take tokens freely without constraints
   - Enables rapid accumulation of RED + BLACK toward N5 noble

2. **PRESTIGE EXPANSION:**
   - Current: 2 prestige
   - After L2_65: 3 prestige
   - Opponent: 1 prestige
   - **NEW POSITION: 3-1 PRESTIGE LEAD (2-point margin)**
   - Opponent locked at 1 (cannot afford L2_48 BLACK requirement, RED:0 blocks L2_70)
   - This 2-point lead is insurmountable given game momentum

3. **RED:1 BONUS SYNERGY:**
   - Gain RED:1 bonus from L2_65
   - Cumulative bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, RED:1
   - Enables cheaper RED acquisitions for future cards (L2_56: RED:5→RED:4 with RED:1 bonus+token reduction, L3_73: RED:6→RED:5)
   - Directly supports N5 noble path (RED requirement)

4. **BOARD REFRESH:**
   - Purchasing L2_65 draws replacement Level 2 card from deck
   - New card may expose additional prestige opportunities
   - Increases future optionality

5. **OPPONENT CONTAINMENT:**
   - Opponent stuck with 1 prestige, no immediate path to 2+
   - L2_48 (opponent reserved): BLUE:2✓, GREEN:3✓, BLACK:3✗ (opponent has BLACK:1, needs BLACK:2 more)
   - L2_70 (opponent reserved): RED:6 cost → Board RED:0 (cannot accumulate without my cooperation)
   - Opponent frozen at 1 prestige minimum 2+ more turns

**POST-PURCHASE STATE (End of Turn 16):**
- Tokens: BLUE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1 (5/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (commanding lead)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, RED:1
- N5 Noble Path remains viable: RED:1 token + future RED accumulation + potential board refresh with RED
- Turn 17 capability: Take 3-color token combo (e.g., GREEN:1 + BLUE:1 + remaining token) to rebuild toward N5 trigger or L2_57 completion

**ALTERNATIVE REJECTION:**
- L1_7 or L1_1: Minimal token liberation (1-2 slots), zero prestige gain, leaves me capacity-constrained
- Token taking loop: Maintains frozen state = wasted turn
- Reserve card: Remains at 10 tokens + no prestige = counterproductive

**CONCLUSION:**
L2_65 is the CRITICAL PIVOT—the ONLY move that simultaneously breaks capacity freeze (5 slots freed), generates prestige momentum (2→3 prestige, 2-point lead), and adds a bonus synergistic with N5 noble strategy. This purchase locks the game in my favor; opponent cannot close the prestige gap within the remaining window before I trigger N5 (3 prestige) or L2_57 (2 prestige) for 5-7 prestige total and victory.

My reserved L2_48 needs 1 more GREEN and 2 more BLACK (after bonuses, I already have enough BLUE). The available tokens are WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. I need to take 3 tokens since I have 7 and want to stay under 10. Taking 1 GREEN and 2 BLACK is optimal because: 1) It directly advances my L2_48 completion (I need exactly 1 GREEN and 2 more BLACK), 2) I avoid RED since I have excess, 3) GREEN and BLACK are available on the board. After this, I'll have 8 tokens total. Since I have a RED bonus and only need 1 more RED for L2_70 (6 RED requirement), I'm positioning to efficiently complete either card next turn.

I need to take tokens to progress toward L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK after bonuses). Available tokens: WHITE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:2, plus others.

Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK (3 different colors) is optimal because:
- 1 GREEN gets me closer to the 3 GREEN needed for L2_48
- 1 BLACK continues my collection toward the 3 BLACK needed
- 1 WHITE gives flexibility for future purchases

After this action: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (10 tokens). I'm at the 10-token limit but that's acceptable since I can't return tokens without dropping below my current holdings. Next turn I'll focus on completing L2_48 or purchasing affordable cards.

2026-01-01 13:10:21.719 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: ERROR CORRECTION: I had 9 tokens total and tried to take 3, which would exceed the 10-token limit. The correct action is to reserve L2_70 from my reserved cards (which I previously reserved).

Current tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (9 total)
I need to stay under 10 tokens, so taking 3 tokens would require returning 2, which is wasteful.

L2_70 costs 6 RED and gives 3 prestige + RED bonus. With my RED bonus of 2, I need 4 more RED. The RED bonus helps reach that goal.

By reserving this card again (from my reserved hand), I gain a gold token, keeping me at 9 tokens total. This preserves all my current tokens while working toward L2_70.

After this action: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (9 tokens). Next turn I can focus on purchasing L1_28 or take more RED tokens for L2_70.

2026-01-01 13:11:29.089 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 17 PRESTIGE CONSOLIDATION - MAINTAIN LEAD & PROGRESS TOWARD NOBLE TRIGGER

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (5 total, 5/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (COMMANDING 3-1 LEAD over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_57 (RED:5, 2 prestige, WHITE bonus)
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:4

**OPPONENT STATUS:**
- Tokens: 9/10 (frozen, only 1 capacity slot)
- Score: 1 prestige
- Cannot immediately purchase high-value prestige cards (blocked by resource constraints)
- L2_48 reserved: Requires BLACK:3, opponent has BLACK:1 (2 short)
- L2_70 reserved: Requires RED:6, board has RED:2 total (insufficient without accumulation)

**STRATEGIC CONTEXT:**
Despite holding commanding 3-1 prestige lead, long-term victory requires reaching 15 total prestige points (need ~12 more). Current token base (5/10) and available board resources enable strategic accumulation toward premium prestige sources.

**N5 NOBLE PATH ANALYSIS (OPTIMAL):**
N5 noble requires RED:4 + BLACK:4 → 3 prestige instant trigger
- Current progress: RED:1/4 (25%), BLACK:1/4 (25%)
- After taking RED:1 + BLACK:1: RED:2/4 (50%), BLACK:2/4 (50%)
- Achievable completion: 2-3 more turns of focused RED + BLACK accumulation
- Timeline to 6 prestige total: Turns 18-19 (2-3 turns away)
- Advantage: Yields 3 prestige in short timeframe, compounds lead to 6-1 vs. opponent's likely 1

**CRITICAL RESOURCE BOTTLENECK:**
RED:2 only remaining on board. This is irreplaceable until card deck refreshes via purchases.
- Essential for N5 noble path (RED:4 requirement)
- Essential for L2_57 alternative path (RED:5 cost)
- Essential for L3_73 endgame (RED:6 cost)
- If opponent captures RED on their turn, my prestige timelines collapse
- MUST capture RED:1 now to maintain prestige momentum

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: RED:1 + WHITE:1 + BLACK:1 (3 different colors)**

1. **RED:1 CRITICAL (RACE CONDITION):**
   - Only RED:2 available; opponent could contest next turn
   - Directly progresses N5 noble (RED:1→RED:2 progress)
   - Simultaneously advances L2_57 secondary path (RED:1→RED:2)
   - Irreplaceable without board deck refresh

2. **BLACK:1 DIRECT NOBLE PROGRESS:**
   - Advances N5 secondary requirement (BLACK:1→BLACK:2)
   - Now 50% toward both N5 conditions (symmetrical progress)
   - Predicts 3-prestige noble trigger within 2-3 turn window

3. **WHITE:1 STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY:**
   - Board has WHITE:2 (ample supply)
   - Supports future N8/N6 noble paths if board conditions change (both require WHITE:3)
   - Provides token diversity for next turn's optional 3-color combos
   - Minimal opportunity cost vs. taking only RED:1 + BLACK:1 (invalid 2-color move)

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- RED:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
- WHITE:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
- BLACK:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
- Exactly 3 different colors (valid form) ✓
- Capacity: 5 current + 3 taking = 8 total ≤ 10 limit ✓
- No token returns required ✓

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2 (8/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (lead maintained)
- N5 Noble Progress: RED:2/4 (50%), BLACK:2/4 (50%)
- Prestige trajectory: N5 noble trigger (3 prestige) → 6 prestige total within 2-3 turns
- Capacity utilization: 8/10 (2 slots preserved for flexibility on Turn 18)

**OPPONENT DEFENSE:**
Opponent frozen at 9/10 tokens with limited moves. Even if opponent purchases low-cost card (L1_3, L1_28) to free capacity, they remain at 1 prestige with no immediate path to high-value prestige sources. My 3-1 lead is insurmountable while opponent remains constrained.

**TURN 18-19 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 18 (opponent acts): Takes tokens or purchases utility card to free capacity (remains prestige-blocked)
- Turn 19 (my turn): Take RED:1 + BLACK:1 + remaining color → RED:3/4, BLACK:3/4 (90% toward completion)
- Turn 20 (my turn or earlier): Capture final RED:1 + BLACK:1 → Trigger N5 noble (3 prestige) → 6 prestige total (5-point lead, game commanding favor)

**CONCLUSION:**
Capturing RED:1 (critical scarcity contest) + BLACK:1 (direct noble progress) + WHITE:1 (flexibility maintenance) accelerates N5 noble trigger within 2-3 turns, expanding prestige lead from 3-1 to 6-1+. Opponent remains prestige-locked while I consolidate victory path.

2026-01-01 13:11:40.628 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1). My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK. After bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:2), I need: 0 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 BLACK. Available tokens on board: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1.

Taking WHITE, GREEN, and BLACK tokens is optimal because:
- 1 GREEN gets me to 3 GREEN total (just 1 short of the 3 needed for L2_48)
- 1 BLACK gets me to 2 BLACK total (just 1 short of the 3 needed for L2_48)
- 1 WHITE preserves flexibility for future purchases like L2_45 (needs 5 WHITE) or L3_76 (needs 7 WHITE)

With 9 tokens, taking 3 tokens puts me at 12, so I need to return 3 tokens. I'll return 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK, leaving me with WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 (8 tokens). This keeps me well under the 10-token limit while making progress toward L2_48's requirements (1 GREEN and 1 BLACK still needed after this turn).

2026-01-01 13:11:55.412 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and can only take 1 more token without exceeding the 10-token limit. This severely limits my options.

Analyzing my reserved cards:
- L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 3 BLACK needed)
- L2_70 needs 6 RED (after bonuses: 4 RED still needed)

I need to pivot toward L2_70 (3 prestige points) because L2_48 requires BLACK tokens which are scarce on the board (only 1 available).

Option 1: Reserve L2_70. This gives me a gold token and maintains my token count at 9. The gold token provides flexibility for future purchases.

Option 2: Take 1 GREEN token. This advances my L2_48 progress but leaves me at 10 tokens with no gold benefit.

Option 3: Purchase L1_7 (3 GREEN cost, BLACK bonus). With my GREEN bonus of 2, I'd effectively pay 1 GREEN token, reducing from 9 to 8 tokens.

Reserving L2_70 is optimal because:
1) I gain a gold token, which can be used for any future purchase
2) It focuses my strategy on the 3-point prestige card L2_70
3) After this, I can prioritize taking RED tokens (need 4 more after bonuses) to complete L2_70
4) The BLACK bonus from L2_70 will help with other BLACK-heavy cards like L2_50 (needs 4 BLACK)

I'll reserve L2_70 to get closer to my goal of 15 prestige points. L2_70 is visible on the board (Level 2 cards).
2026-01-01 13:11:55.412 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_70, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

2026-01-01 13:12:24.554 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and need to determine my best move. My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses need 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 3 BLACK). L2_70 needs 6 RED (after bonuses need 4 more RED).

**Token Analysis:** I have 8 tokens, so I can only take 2 more before hitting the 10 limit. Available tokens: WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, BLUE:0. I cannot take 3 different colors (only 4 available) and cannot take 2 of the same color (no color has 4+). Taking 2 tokens isn't optimal since I'd take 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN, but this doesn't significantly advance my goals.

**Purchase Analysis:** L1_28 costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 WHITE. With bonuses, I need 0 BLUE (have 2, bonus covers 1), 1 GREEN. I have the tokens but this doesn't help my reserved cards.

**Reserve Strategy:** L1_7 is available with a BLACK bonus. This gives me a gold token which is valuable for flexibility. My goal is to collect BLACK tokens for L2_48 completion. After reserving, I'll take 2 WHITE tokens next turn to work toward L2_45 (needs 5 WHITE, gives BLACK bonus).

L1_7 is confirmed on the board. This reserve gives me a gold token while keeping me at 8 tokens, positioning me for strategic future moves.

2026-01-01 13:12:24.554 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3}
2026-01-01 13:13:34.271 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 18 CRITICAL DECISION - SECURE RED SCARCITY & ADVANCE N5 NOBLE RELENTLESSLY

**CURRENT POSITION:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2 (8/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (COMMANDING 3-1 LEAD)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1
- N5 Noble requires: RED:4, BLACK:4
- Current progress: RED:2/4 (50%), BLACK:2/4 (50%)
- Board tokens available: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:3

**OPPONENT STATUS:**
- Tokens: 10/10 (FROZEN at capacity)
- Score: 1 prestige (insurmountable deficit)
- Opponent has reserved L2_70 (RED:6 cost, 3 prestige) but RED scarcity blocks it
- No prestige-generating cards are affordable to opponent (L2_48 blocked by BLACK requirement)

**CRITICAL BOTTLENECK RACE: RED:1 LAST ON BOARD**
RED:1 is THE limiting resource in the endgame:
- Only RED:1 remains available globally (opponent also constrained)
- If not captured this turn, opponent could seize it on their turn
- Or it remains uncaptured, limiting both players' prestige paths
- I MUST take RED:1 now to maintain prestige momentum

**OPTIMAL TOKEN SELECTION: WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 (3 different colors, return GREEN:1)**

**Rationale:**

1. **RED:1 CRITICAL RACE (MUST SECURE):**
   - Only RED:1 on entire board
   - Directly progresses N5 noble (RED:2→RED:3, 75% satisfied)
   - Would be catastrophic if opponent captures it
   - After taking: RED:3/4 (only 1 token away from requirement!)

2. **BLACK:1 DUAL-PATH VALUE:**
   - Advances N5 secondary requirement (BLACK:2→BLACK:3, 75% satisfied)
   - Both N5 conditions symmetric at 75% (RED:3/4, BLACK:3/4)
   - N5 noble trigger now achievable within 2 turns maximum
   - Yields 3 prestige instantly when triggered (6 prestige total, 5-point margin vs opponent)

3. **WHITE:1 MANDATORY THIRD COLOR:**
   - Board has WHITE:1 (ample supply)
   - Satisfies 3-different-color token-taking rule
   - Provides strategic flexibility for future 3-color combos
   - Low opportunity cost (not critical to N5 path)

4. **CAPACITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:**
   - Current: 8 tokens
   - After taking 3: 11 tokens → MUST return 1
   - Return GREEN:1 (expendable for N5 focus)
   - Final: 10/10 capacity, but N5 at 75%/%75 completion
   - Next turn: Purchase L1_3 (WHITE:1 + BLUE:2 effective cost) → Free 3 slots → Position for final N5 accumulation (GREEN:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 → Trigger N5 noble immediately)

5. **BOARD VERIFICATION:**
   - WHITE:1 on board ≥ 1 ✓
   - RED:1 on board ≥ 1 ✓
   - BLACK:1 on board ≥ 1 ✓
   - Exactly 3 different colors (valid form) ✓
   - Capacity: 8 current + 3 taking = 11 total → Return 1 = 10 final ≤ 10 limit ✓
   - Returning GREEN:1 (self-owned token) ✓

**POST-ACTION STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:3 (10/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (lead maintained during accumulation phase)
- N5 Noble Progress: RED:3/4 (75%), BLACK:3/4 (75%) - CRITICAL THRESHOLD ACHIEVED
- Prestige trajectory: 2-turn window to N5 trigger (TURN 19-20) → 6 prestige total (5-point lead, game locked/won)

**TURN 19-20 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 19 (opponent acts + my turn): Opponent frozen at capacity, cannot intercept prestige. I purchase L1_3 (frees 3 slots) → Tokens become 7/10
- Turn 20 (my next turn): Take GREEN:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 (if board has them via refresh) → Tokens become WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:4 (10/10) → **IMMEDIATE N5 NOBLE TRIGGER (3 prestige)** → Score 6 prestige (opponent still locked at 1)
- Subsequent turns: Purchase L2_57 via GOLD accumulation (RED:5→RED:4 with RED:1 bonus, GOLD:3 filling gap) → 8 prestige total
- Victory secured: 8-point prestige lead with opponent unable to catch up

**WHY NOT ALTERNATIVES?**
- TAKE_GOLD:2 (same-color): Frozen capacity persists, NO prestige or N5 progress (wasted turn)
- PURCHASE_CARD (L1_1/L1_3/L1_4): Frees capacity but delays RED capture, risking opponent seizing RED:1
- RESERVE_CARD: Gains GOLD:1 but does NOT capture critical RED, capacity still blocked (suboptimal)

**CONCLUSION:**
RED:1 is the final scarcity gating prestige in endgame. This move secures it while advancing N5 to 75%/%75 completion, locks victory within 2 turns, and prevents opponent from closing the gap from 3-1 to insurmountable 6-1 prestige lead.

2026-01-01 13:13:56.781 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with 10 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2) and bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:2. My reserved cards are L2_48 (needs 1 GREEN, 2 BLACK after bonuses), L2_70 (needs 3 more RED), and L1_7 (needs 3 GREEN). **Token Analysis:** I have 10 tokens, so I cannot take any tokens that would exceed the limit. Available tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:3. The only color with tokens available is GREEN (2 available). **Purchase Analysis:** I can purchase L1_7 (needs 3 GREEN, gives BLACK bonus) because I have 2 GREEN + 2 GOLD = 4 total, enough to cover the 3 GREEN cost. **Reserve Analysis:** I cannot reserve because I have 10 tokens and any reserve action wouldn't change my token count, leaving me stuck again next turn. **Decision:** Take 1 GREEN token to progress toward completing L1_7. With 10 tokens, I must return 1 token to stay under the limit. I should return 1 RED token (I only need 3 more RED for L2_70 anyway). After this: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (9 tokens). Next turn I'll purchase L1_7 with my 3 GREEN + 2 GOLD, getting a BLACK bonus to help with L2_48.

2026-01-01 13:14:14.778 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 10 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2) and need to make a valid move. Taking 3 different colors is impossible since only GREEN tokens (2) are available on the board. Taking 2 of the same color is valid since GREEN has 2 available.

Taking 2 GREEN tokens is optimal because:
1) It follows the rules (2 of same color, 2 available)
2) I can use these tokens to purchase L1_28 next turn (costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 WHITE - I have all these)
3) L1_28 gives a GREEN bonus, which helps with my reserved L2_48 that needs 3 GREEN tokens
4) After taking 2 GREEN, I'll have 8 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 2 GOLD - all under the 10-token limit

This sets me up to purchase L1_28 next turn and work toward completing my reserved L2_48 card.

2026-01-01 13:14:24.355 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 10 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2). I cannot take tokens because I'm at the limit. Let me analyze purchase options:

**L1_7 Analysis:** Costs 3 GREEN. With bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:2), I need 3 GREEN (no GREEN bonus). I have 2 GREEN + 2 GOLD. I'll use 2 GOLD as GREEN substitutes. After purchase: 3 GREEN + 2 GOLD → 3 spent, leaving 2 GOLD. Total: 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 0 GOLD (7 tokens).

Benefits: Gets BLACK bonus (helps L2_48), reduces tokens from 10 to 7, unlocks token-taking next turn.

**L1_28 Analysis:** Costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 WHITE. With bonuses, I need 0 BLUE, 1 GREEN. I have tokens but only get GREEN bonus - doesn't help reserved cards significantly.

**L1_3 Analysis:** Costs 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. With bonuses, I need 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 0 RED. Not optimal.

**L1_1 Analysis:** Costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. With bonuses, I need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED. Not optimal.

**L1_4 Analysis:** Costs 1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK. With bonuses, I need 1 GREEN, 2 RED, 1 BLACK. Not optimal.

**Conclusion:** L1_7 is optimal. It gives BLACK bonus (crucial for L2_48 which needs 3 BLACK), reduces tokens from 10 to 7, and positions me to take BLACK/GREEN tokens next turn when available. GOLD can substitute for GREEN in the purchase, so I use 2 GOLD tokens along with 2 GREEN tokens to cover the 3 GREEN cost.

After purchase: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (7 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. Next turn I'll take BLACK and GREEN tokens from the board (2 each) to work toward L2_48 completion.

**Note on previous error:** I attempted to take 2 GREEN tokens but only 2 were available on the board. The rule requires taking EXACTLY 2 tokens of the same color (needing 4 available) or EXACTLY 3 of different colors. I cannot take 2 tokens of different colors. Since I was at 10 tokens, I couldn't take 3 tokens of different colors (only 4 colors available anyway). I should have recognized this limitation earlier.

Action: PURCHASE_CARD L1_7

2026-01-01 13:16:24.295 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 19 CRITICAL DECISION - BREAK FROZEN CAPACITY & SET UP IMMEDIATE N5 TRIGGER

**CURRENT BOTTLENECK:**
- Tokens: 10/10 capacity (FULL)
- Score: 3 prestige (COMMANDING 3-1 LEAD)
- N5 Noble: RED:3/4 (75%), BLACK:3/4 (75%) - ONLY 2 TOKENS AWAY!
- Board tokens: GREEN:4 only (RED:0, BLACK:0, WHITE:0, BLUE:0)

**CAPACITY CRISIS:**
At 10/10, I cannot accumulate additional tokens without capacity liberation. Taking GREEN:2 (only valid move with 1 color available) while returning 2 tokens = zero net progress (wasted turn).

**AFFORDABLE PURCHASE ANALYSIS:**

L1_3: Cost WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1
- Effective cost: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:0
- Token payment required: WHITE:1 + BLUE:2 = 3 tokens
- My resources: WHITE:2 ✓≥1, BLUE:2 ✓≥2
- **STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓
- Result: Tokens 10 - 3 = **7/10 capacity (3 SLOTS FREED)**
- Bonus: BLACK:1 (future purchases slightly cheaper)
- Prestige: 0 (unchanged, focused on N5 setup)

**L1_3 IS THE DOMINATING PLAY:**

1. **BREAK FROZEN CAPACITY (CRITICAL):**
   - Frees exactly 3 token slots
   - After purchase: 7/10 capacity + 3 slots available
   - Enables next turn: Take 3 different colors (standard token combo)

2. **IMMEDIATE N5 NOBLE TRIGGER (TURN 20):**
   - Current position: RED:3/4, BLACK:3/4 (only need RED:1 + BLACK:1)
   - After L1_3 purchase: 7/10 capacity
   - Turn 20 capability: Take RED:1 + BLACK:1 + GREEN:1 (if board refreshed)
   - Result state: RED:4, BLACK:4 (exactly N5 trigger requirements!)
   - **AUTOMATIC N5 NOBLE ACTIVATION: +3 prestige**
   - Score: 3 → 6 prestige (opponent still frozen at 1)

3. **PRESTIGE MOMENTUM:**
   - Current lead: 3-1 = 2-point margin
   - After N5 trigger (1 turn away): 6-1 = 5-point margin
   - This margin becomes insurmountable (opponent has no prestige sources reachable within timeframe)

4. **ALTERNATIVE REJECTION (L2_50):**
   - L2_50 gives +2 prestige immediately (3→5)
   - But costs: WHITE:1, BLACK:3 (after WHITE:1, BLACK:1 bonuses)
   - **PROBLEM:** Would consume ALL BLACK:3 tokens!
   - Result: N5 path destroyed (RED:3/4, BLACK:0/4 - unrecoverable)
   - Leaves me at 5 prestige with no immediate prestige source
   - Alternative L2 cards now unaffordable (L2_56 needs RED:4, L2_61 needs WHITE:3)
   - **SUBOPTIMAL: Sacrifices guaranteed 6 prestige (via N5) for uncertain 5 prestige (via L2_50)**

5. **BOARD VERIFICATION:**
   - WHITE:2 ≥ 1 ✓
   - BLUE:2 ≥ 2 ✓
   - RED:1 available (bonus reduction, don't need to pay)
   - Payment only in WHITE + BLUE ✓
   - Capacity: 10 - 3 = 7/10 ≤ 10 ✓

**POST-PURCHASE STATE (End Turn 19):**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:3 (7/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (unchanged, momentum built)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, +BLACK:1 bonus purchased
- Capacity: 3/10 available for next turn
- N5 trigger achievable: GREEN:1 (board) + RED:1 (board) + BLACK:1 (already have): RED:4, BLACK:4 → **IMMEDIATE +3 PRESTIGE TRIGGER**

**TURN 20 TRAJECTORY:**
- Opponent acts: Likely frozen at capacity or takes low-value move
- My turn (20): Take 3 colors from refreshed board → Trigger N5 noble → Score 6 prestige
- Result: 6-1 prestige lead (5-point margin, game mathematically won)

**CONCLUSION:**
L1_3 is the OPTIMAL PIVOT—it breaks frozen capacity, preserves the imminent N5 trigger (only 1 turn away), and positions me for immediate prestige jump from 3 to 6 within the next turn sequence. This guarantees victory while L2_50 alternatives sacrifice prestige momentum by destroying the N5 path.

2026-01-01 13:16:34.093 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 7 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 3 BLACK). L2_70 needs 6 RED (after bonuses: 4 more RED).

**Token Analysis:** I need GREEN tokens for L2_48 but currently have 0. There are 4 GREEN available on the board, which means I can take 2 of the same color (rule: take EXACTLY 2 tokens of the SAME color when 4+ available). This gives me the 2 GREEN I need for L2_48.

BLACK and RED are 0 on the board, so I cannot take those needed colors.

**Alternative Option Check:** I could take 3 different colors (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN) but that would give me only 1 GREEN instead of 2. Taking 2 GREEN directly advances my L2_48 goal more efficiently.

**Token Limit:** 7 current + 2 taking = 9 tokens, which is under the 10-token limit. No need to return tokens.

**Final State:** WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (9 tokens). This positions me to complete L2_48 when BLACK tokens become available on the board (need 3 more BLACK, currently have 1 with bonus).

2026-01-01 13:17:58.447 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 20 PRESTIGE CONSOLIDATION - PIVOT TO DIRECT PRESTIGE ACCUMULATION

**CURRENT BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:3 (7/10 capacity)
- Score: 3 prestige (leading 3-1 vs opponent 1)
- Board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:4 (RED/BLACK DEPLETED)

**N5 NOBLE REALITY CORRECTION:**
Previous reasoning anticipated N5 trigger imminent, but actual board state reveals critical blocker:
- N5 requires RED:4 bonus cards + BLACK:4 bonus cards from purchased cards
- Current bonuses: RED:1 (need 3 more), BLACK:2 (need 2 more)
- Affordable RED-bonus cards on board: NONE visible
- Affordable BLACK-bonus cards on board: L2_45 (WHITE:5 cost—unaffordable), L3_73 (GREEN:3, RED:6, BLACK:3—unaffordable)
- Conclusion: N5 path blocked this turn; requires 5+ specific multi-turn purchases
- Token strategy (take WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + GREEN:1) reaches 10/10 capacity with ZERO prestige gain (wasted turn)

**OPTIMAL MOVE: PURCHASE L2_50**

**Affordability Verification:**
Card: L2_50 | Base Cost: WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:4 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: BLUE:1
My Bonuses: WHITE:1 (L1_21), GREEN:2 (L1_31+L2_60), RED:1 (L2_65), BLACK:2 (L2_42+L1_3)

Effective Cost Reduction:
- WHITE: 2 - 1 (bonus) = WHITE:1 to pay
- RED: 1 - 1 (bonus) = RED:0 to pay  
- BLACK: 4 - 2 (bonus) = BLACK:2 to pay

Payment Required: WHITE:1 + BLACK:2
My Resources: WHITE:1 ✓, BLACK:3 ✓
**STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓

**Strategic Impact:**

1. **PRESTIGE EXPANSION (CRITICAL):**
   - Current: 3 prestige
   - After L2_50: 5 prestige
   - Opponent: 1 prestige (locked, cannot afford L2_48 or L2_70)
   - **NEW LEAD: 4-POINT MARGIN (5-1)**
   - This margin is insurmountable; opponent frozen at 1 prestige minimum 3+ turns

2. **CAPACITY LIBERATION:**
   - Cost: WHITE:1 + BLACK:2 = 3 tokens consumed
   - Result: 7 - 3 = 4 tokens remaining (4/10 capacity)
   - **FREED: 6 token slots for Turn 21 accumulation**
   - Enables rapid non-constrained token buildup

3. **BONUS SYNERGY EXPANSION:**
   - Gain BLUE:1 bonus
   - Cumulative bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, BLUE:1
   - 5 distinct bonus tracks enable multi-card purchase chains
   - Supports Turn 22+ purchases: L2_56 (RED:4 effective cost after RED:1 bonus, +2 prestige), L2_61 (WHITE/BLUE reduction)

4. **OPPONENT LOCKOUT VERIFIED:**
   - Opponent at 10/10 tokens (capacity frozen)
   - L2_48 (reserved): Requires GREEN:3 (opponent has GREEN:2, 1 short) + BLUE:2 + BLACK:3—UNAFFORDABLE
   - L2_70 (reserved): Requires RED:6 (opponent has RED:1, 5 short)—UNAFFORDABLE
   - Opponent has NO prestige-card path open this turn
   - 4-point lead guarantees my victory unless I make critical error

5. **PRAGMATIC PIVOT FROM STALLED N5:**
   - N5 path requires 3 more RED-bonus + 2 more BLACK-bonus (5 multi-turn acquisitions)
   - No Red-bonus cards accessible now; market has ZERO RED-bonus alternatives
   - Direct prestige-card accumulation (L2_50 +2, follow with L2_56 +2, L2_61 +2, Level 3 +4) proven faster route to 15 prestige
   - Bonus cards now secondary objective after prestige threshold reached

**POST-PURCHASE STATE (End Turn 20):**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, RED:3, BLACK:1 (4/10 capacity)
- Score: 5 prestige (4-point lead, opponent trapped at 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:2 (5-track engine)
- Prestige trajectory: 5 now → 7+ (Turn 21-22 via L2_56 or alternative L1/L2 purchases) → 9+ (subsequent turns via Level 3 cards)
- Victory pace: 5 prestige by Turn 20, trajectory to 15 prestige by Turn 25-28 (vs opponent frozen at 1)

**TURN 21-22 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 21: Opponent takes tokens or low-value card (prestige-blocked). My Turn 21: Accumulate 6 tokens (board likely refreshed with RED/BLACK after opponent+my purchases). Potential GOLD:2 capture (4 GOLD available on board).
- Turn 22: Purchase L2_56 (RED:5→RED:4 effective with RED:1 bonus, +2 prestige) if RED:4 tokens accumulated → Score 7 prestige (opponent still at 1, 6-point gap)
- Turn 23+: Transition to Level 3 prestige cards (L3_73 +4, requiring GREEN:3, RED:6, BLACK:3 effective costs) for final prestige blitz

**CONCLUSION:**
L2_50 is the CRITICAL TURN—it abandons the stalled N5 multi-turn grind, secures immediate +2 prestige (5-1 lead), liberates 6 token slots for Turn 21 free accumulation, and locks opponent completely out of prestige path (1-prestige frozen state verified). This establishes commanding end-game dominance; opponent cannot catch up within any reasonable timeframe. The victory is strategically secured.

2026-01-01 13:18:22.697 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and need to determine my optimal move.

**Current Goal Analysis:** My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses: 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 2 BLACK). I have 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK.

**Token Limit:** 9 current tokens, so I can take at most 1 more token before hitting the 10-token limit.

**Board Analysis:** Available tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2. No color has 4+ tokens, so I cannot take 2 of the same color.

**Strategic Choice:** Taking 1 token isn't optimal since it only gives me 1 of any color. However, I notice GREEN tokens on the board. Looking at my options:
- L1_29 is available for purchase (costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, gives GREEN bonus, 0 prestige)
- Purchasing L1_29 uses my 2 WHITE and 1 BLUE tokens
- After purchase: 6 tokens total (0 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 1 GOLD) with a GREEN bonus

**Why purchase L1_29:**
1. It gives me a GREEN bonus, which reduces L2_48's GREEN cost from 3 to 2
2. After bonuses, L2_48 would need: 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK
3. I would have: 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, 1 GOLD (6 tokens)
4. This positions me to take 2 GREEN tokens next turn (board has 2 available)
5. After that, I'd have 3 GREEN + 1 GOLD = 4 GREEN, getting very close to completing L2_48

**Alternative:** Taking tokens now would leave me at 10 tokens, forcing me to return 1. This wastes a turn.

**Final Decision:** Purchase L1_29 for the GREEN bonus, then take 2 GREEN tokens next turn to work toward L2_48 completion.

2026-01-01 13:18:36.177 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm Player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. My goal is to complete L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK after bonuses). Current board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:4.

**Token Limit Analysis:** I have 9 tokens, so I can take at most 1 token before hitting the 10-token limit. Actually wait - I can take 3 different colors and return 1, OR take 3 different colors to reach exactly 10.

**Token-Taking Options:**
- Taking 3 different colors (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN): Each has 2 available, so this is valid. 9 + 3 = 12 tokens would exceed the limit, requiring 2 returns. That's messy.
- Wait, the previous error message said only 2 GREEN were available. But GREEN shows 2 on the board... Let me re-verify.

**Alternative Strategy - Purchase L1_28 first:**
- L1_28 costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 WHITE
- With my bonuses: need 0 BLUE (have 2, bonus covers), 1 GREEN, 0 WHITE
- Cost: 1 GREEN token
- After purchase: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens)
- This gives me a GREEN bonus, improving my future purchasing power
- Then next turn I can take 2 GREEN (if available) to work toward L2_48

**Checking if I can purchase L1_28:**
- L1_28 is visible on board (LEVEL_1, id: L1_28)
- I have all required tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1
- With bonuses, I need: 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 0 BLACK
- I have 2 GREEN tokens, so I can afford it!

**Decision:** Purchasing L1_28 is optimal because:
1) I can afford it with my current tokens
2) It gives me a GREEN bonus, which helps with L2_48 (needs 3 GREEN)
3) After purchase I'll have 6 tokens, freeing up space for more strategic token-taking
4) The only cost is 1 GREEN token, which I'm not using effectively otherwise

After purchase: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1.

Next turn I'll assess whether to take tokens or reserve/purchase another card based on board state.

My goal is to complete L2_48 which needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses: 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 2 BLACK).

**Board Analysis:** Available tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:4. L1_7 is available for purchase (costs 3 GREEN, gives BLACK bonus), but I have 0 GREEN tokens currently.

**Strategy:** I need to take tokens to work toward L2_48. Taking 2 BLACK tokens is optimal because:
1) BLACK is scarce on the board (2 available now, may run out later)
2) L1_4 gives BLACK bonus which helps L2_48, but I need more GREEN/RED tokens first
3) After taking 2 BLACK, I'll have 9 tokens total (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1)

**Future Plan:** With 9 tokens, next turn I could purchase L1_4 (needs 1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK - after bonuses: 1 GREEN, 2 RED) if enough GREEN/RED tokens appear on the board. Taking BLACK tokens now reduces L2_48's BLACK requirement from 3 to 2.

I cannot take 3 different colors because RED is unavailable (0 on board). Taking 2 BLACK tokens is my best move.

2026-01-01 13:21:06.838 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 21 - PIVOT STRATEGY: RED:0 BOARD BLOCKS L2_56 PATH

**CURRENT POSITION:**
- Tokens: RED:3, BLACK:1 (4/10 capacity)
- Prestige: 5 (commanding 5-1 lead vs opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2, GOLD:4

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT DISCOVERED:**
- RED:0 on board = PERMANENT RED DEPLETION
- L2_56 requires RED:4 effective cost → I have RED:3 tokens only
- Cannot acquire more RED (RED:0 exists on board, tokens don't replenish mid-game)
- L2_56 is FOREVER UNAFFORDABLE
- Previous N5 noble strategy is also blocked (requires RED:4 in bonuses, no RED-bonus cards available to purchase)

**STRATEGIC PIVOT: SECONDARY PRESTIGE PATH VIA L2_47**

Card: L2_47 | Cost: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3 | Prestige: +1 | Bonus: BLUE:1
With my bonuses (BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1):
- Effective cost: BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:2
- Currently affordable? Red:3 ✓, but BLUE:0 ✗
- Solution: Take BLUE:1 token this turn → next turn, afford L2_47

**OPTIMAL TOKEN TAKING: WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + GREEN:1 (3 different colors)**

1. **BLUE:1 CRITICAL FOR L2_47 PATH:**
   - Board has BLUE:2 available (not 4+, cannot take BLUE:2 same-color)
   - Must take 3-color combo to include BLUE:1
   - After taking: BLUE:1 allows L2_47 purchase next turn
   - L2_47 yields +1 prestige (5→6), maintains dominant margin

2. **WHITE + GREEN STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY:**
   - WHITE:1 board availability (not needed immediately for L2_47, but provides token diversity)
   - GREEN:1 board availability (offers future optionality for Level 3 cards if accumulation continues)
   - Both support future multi-card purchase chains

3. **BOARD VERIFICATION:**
   - WHITE:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
   - BLUE:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
   - GREEN:2 on board ≥ 1 ✓
   - Exactly 3 different colors (valid 3-color take) ✓
   - Capacity: 4 current + 3 taking = 7/10 ≤ 10 ✓
   - No token returns required ✓

4. **POST-ACTION STATE:**
   - Tokens: RED:3, BLACK:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 (7/10 capacity)
   - Next turn: Purchase L2_47 (costs BLUE:1, RED:2) → Prestige 6, tokens RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1, GREEN:1
   - Prestige progression: 5→6 (next turn via L2_47) → 7+ (subsequent turns via Level 2/3 accumulation)
   - Opponent remains locked at 1 prestige (cannot access prestige cards due to resource constraints)

**TURN 22-23 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 22 (opponent acts): Frozen at capacity or takes low-value action
- Turn 23 (my turn): Purchase L2_47, prestige jumps 5→6 (still commanding 6-1+ lead)
- Turn 24+: Reassess board for Level 3 opportunities or further Level 2 prestige cards (L2_45, L2_61 remain blocked by WHITE/cost constraints, but board refreshes might improve options)

**CONCLUSION:**
RED:0 depletion forces abandonment of the L2_56 multi-turn accumulation strategy, but secondary L2_47 path remains viable and achieves +1 prestige consolidation within 2 turns. This maintains my commanding 5-point prestige lead (expanding to 6-point after L2_47 purchase) while I position for endgame Level 3 card transitions. Opponent remains mathematically eliminated from prestige competition.

2026-01-01 13:21:06.838 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
2026-01-01 13:21:17.355 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and can only take 1 more token before hitting the limit. Let me analyze all options:

**Taking Tokens:** Available tokens are WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:2. Taking any single token (e.g., 1 BLACK) doesn't significantly advance my goals toward L2_48 (needs 2 more BLACK) or L2_70 (needs 4 more RED).

**Purchasing L1_29:** Costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE for GREEN bonus. With my bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1), I effectively need 1 WHITE, 0 BLUE. I have the tokens! This purchase would:
- Reduce my token count from 9 to 6 (efficiently burning tokens)
- Give me a GREEN bonus (my 3rd GREEN bonus, now have GREEN:2)
- Position me better for L2_48 which needs 3 GREEN (after bonuses)

**Other visible cards:**
- L1_28 costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 WHITE - with bonuses need 1 GREEN, gives GREEN bonus
- L1_4 costs 1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK - expensive RED cost not helpful

**Alternative:** Reserve a card for gold, but I already have GOLD:1 and taking a token would still leave me at 9 tokens.

L1_29 is optimal because it's the only visible card I can afford that gives a useful GREEN bonus. The purchase reduces my tokens from 9 to 6, unlocking my ability to take tokens next turn. After purchase: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:1. This gives me more GREEN bonuses for L2_48 completion.

2026-01-01 13:22:19.929 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 22 - PRESTIGE CONSOLIDATION VIA L2_47 PURCHASE

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1 (7/10 capacity)
- Score: 5 prestige (commanding 5-1 lead vs opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2

**OPPONENT STATUS:**
- Tokens: 8/10 (near capacity, limited accumulation flexibility)
- Score: 1 prestige (locked out of prestige acquisition)
- L2_48 reserved: Requires GREEN:3, BLACK:3 effective. Opponent has GREEN:2 ✗, BLACK:1 ✗. UNAFFORDABLE.
- L2_70 reserved: Requires RED:6 effective. Opponent has RED:1 ✗. UNAFFORDABLE.
- No viable prestige path available this turn or next 2+ turns

**L2_47 AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:**
Card: L2_47 | Base Cost: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3 | Prestige: +1 | Bonus: BLUE:1

Effective Cost Calculation with my bonuses (BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1):
- BLUE: 2 - 1 (bonus) = 1 needed
- GREEN: 2 - 2 (bonus) = 0 needed
- RED: 3 - 1 (bonus) = 2 needed

Payment Required: BLUE:1 + RED:2
My Resources: BLUE:1 ✓≥1, RED:3 ✓≥2
**STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓

**STRATEGIC IMPACT:**

1. **PRESTIGE EXPANSION (CRITICAL):**
   - Current score: 5 prestige
   - After L2_47 purchase: 6 prestige
   - Opponent locked: 1 prestige (cannot purchase prestige cards)
   - **NEW LEAD: 5-POINT MARGIN (6-1)**
   - This margin is mathematically insurmountable in remaining game

2. **CAPACITY LIBERATION:**
   - Token cost: BLUE:1 + RED:2 = 3 tokens spent
   - Capacity after purchase: 7 - 3 = 4/10 (6 SLOTS FREED)
   - Enables Turn 23+ free accumulation for Level 3 prestige cards
   - No capacity constraint for endgame acceleration

3. **BONUS ENGINE UPGRADE:**
   - Gain BLUE:1 bonus → BLUE:2 total
   - Cumulative bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
   - Enhanced purchasing power for remaining Level 2 and Level 3 prestige cards
   - Future cards become progressively cheaper

4. **OPPONENT LOCKOUT CONFIRMED:**
   - Opponent frozen at prestige 1 (no acquisition path)
   - Even if opponent purchases utility cards to free capacity, no prestige sources accessible
   - No viable noble path available (N5 blocked by RED scarcity, N6/N8 blocked by WHITE/BLUE scarcity)
   - Victory mathematically secured

5. **BOARD STATE VERIFICATION:**
   - L2_47 exists in face-up Level 2 cards ✓
   - Payment tokens available: BLUE:1 ✓, RED:3 ✓
   - Effective cost: BLUE:1, RED:2 ✓
   - Capacity: 7 current + 0 taking = 7, then - 3 payment = 4/10 ≤ 10 ✓

**POST-PURCHASE STATE (End Turn 22):**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (4/10 capacity)
- Score: 6 prestige (5-point insurmountable lead)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Prestige trajectory: 6 now → 10+ (Turn 24 via Level 3 accumulation) → 15 (victory within 3-4 turns maximum)

**TURN 23-24 ROADMAP:**
- Turn 23 (opponent acts): Opponent takes tokens or low-value card (prestige-blocked, cannot close gap)
- My Turn 23: Accumulate 6 tokens freely. Board tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:2) + future refreshes enable rapid stack-building.
- Turn 24 opportunity: Pursue Level 3 prestige cards (L3_86 +5 prestige needs BLUE:5 effective with upgrades, achievable by Turn 24 or 25)
- Victory lock: Commanding 6-1 prestige lead with opponent mathematically eliminated from competition

**CONCLUSION:**
L2_47 purchase is dominant—it secures immediate +1 prestige (extending 5-1 to commanding 6-1 lead), liberates 6 tokens for endgame acceleration, and absolutely locks the opponent out of prestige competition. Combined with opponent's capacity and resource constraints, this move guarantees victory within 2-3 additional turns. No alternative (token accumulation, card reservation, or hold) provides equivalent strategic value.

2026-01-01 13:22:40.778 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and can take up to 2 more before hitting the 10-token limit. My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses I need: 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 BLACK). Board available tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2.

Taking 3 different tokens (WHITE, GREEN, BLACK) is optimal because:
- 1 BLACK gets me closer to the 2 BLACK I need for L2_48
- 1 GREEN gets me closer to the 1 more GREEN I need for L2_48
- 1 WHITE gives me flexibility for future purchases

After taking: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (9 tokens). This positions me to potentially complete L2_48 next turn (would need 1 more BLACK, which I could take if available). The board has 2 BLACK available, so this move is valid. My 9 tokens leave room to take more next turn if needed.

Alternative considered: Taking 2 BLACK tokens, but no color has 4+ on board (max is 2). Taking 2 tokens of different colors is not allowed. This approach maximizes my progress toward L2_48 completion while staying under the token limit.

2026-01-01 13:22:56.748 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- I have 8 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK → after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED → after bonuses: 4 RED)

**Why Reserve L1_8:**
- L1_8 costs 4 BLUE and gives a BLACK bonus
- After reserving: I get 1 GOLD token
- My token count becomes: 1+2+2+1+1+1 = 8 tokens (same count, just added gold)
- The BLACK bonus helps L2_48 which needs 3 BLACK (after bonuses: 2 more)
- GOLD is a wildcard that can substitute for any color

**Token Limit Check:**
- Current: 8 tokens, After reserve: 8 tokens (no issue with 10-token limit)
- Next turn I can take tokens freely since I'm at 8/10

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking 3 tokens would exceed the limit (8+3=11 > 10), so I cannot take tokens this turn
- Buying a card would reduce tokens but L1_8 is strategically better than the affordable L1_1 (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED) or L1_4 (1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK) which don't help my reserved cards as much

**Final State After Reserve:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2
- Ready to take 3 tokens next turn (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN) to work toward L2_48 completion
- Positioned to purchase L1_8 once I have more BLUE tokens

2026-01-01 13:25:40.507 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- I have 9 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:2)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK → after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED → after bonuses: 4 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Purchase Analysis (L1_4):**
- Costs: 1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK
- After bonuses: 0 GREEN (have 2 + bonus), 1 RED, 0 BLACK (have 1 + bonus)
- Tokens needed: 1 RED only
- I have RED:1 and GOLD:2 available

**Why L1_4 is Optimal:**
1. **Token Efficiency:** Reduces tokens from 9 to 5 (burns 4 tokens productively)
2. **Bonus Value:** Gets BLACK bonus (my 2nd BLACK bonus), critical for L2_48 which needs 3 BLACK
3. **Goal Alignment:** After this purchase, I'll have BLACK:2 bonus, which combined with my existing BLACK tokens puts me close to L2_48 completion
4. **Positioning:** At 5 tokens, I'll be able to take 3 tokens next turn (WHITE, BLUE, RED) to work toward L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking 1 token (e.g., 1 BLACK) leaves me at 10 tokens with no progress
- L1_1 is affordable but gives BLACK bonus instead of GREEN (L1_4's BLACK bonus is more useful for L2_48)
- L1_32 costs 4 BLACK, which I cannot afford

**Final State:** WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. I'm now much closer to completing L2_48 and can take 3 tokens next turn to work toward L1_8.

**CURRENT BOARD CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:2, GOLD:3
- GREEN:0 on board blocks previous planned token taking (WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + GREEN:1)
- Must revise to alternative 3-color combination

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 (7/10 capacity)
- Score: 6 prestige (commanding 5-point lead over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Opponent locked: Cannot afford any prestige cards (L2_48, L2_70 both unaffordable due to resource gaps)

**VIABLE 3-COLOR COMBINATIONS AVAILABLE:**
1. WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + RED:1 ✓ (OPTIMAL)
2. WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + BLACK:1 ✓
3. WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 ✓
4. BLUE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 ✗ (excludes WHITE, see analysis)

**OPTIMAL SELECTION: WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + RED:1**

**L2_61 AFFORDABILITY SETUP (TARGET PURCHASE TURN 25):**
- L2_61 Base Cost: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, BLACK:1 | +2 prestige | GREEN bonus
- My bonuses reduce cost: WHITE:4-1=3, BLUE:2-2=0, BLACK:1-2=0 (negative cancels to 0)
- Effective payment required: WHITE:3 ONLY
- After taking WHITE:1+BLUE:1+RED:1: My tokens → WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1
- Verification: WHITE:3 available ✓ → L2_61 becomes 100% PURCHASABLE next turn

**CAPACITY CALCULATION:**
- Current capacity: 7/10 (WHITE:2+BLUE:1+GREEN:2+RED:1+BLACK:1)
- Taking 3 tokens: +3 tokens
- Result: 7 + 3 = 10/10 ✓ (EXACTLY at capacity, no returns required)

**BOARD TOKEN VERIFICATION:**
- WHITE:1 available on board ✓
- BLUE:1 available on board ✓
- RED:3 available on board ≥ 1 ✓
- GREEN:0 blocks previous strategy, but WHITE inclusion resolves L2_61 path ✓
- Valid 3-different-color combination ✓

**PRESTIGE TRAJECTORY:**
1. Turn 24 (current): Take WHITE:1+BLUE:1+RED:1 → reach 10/10 capacity
2. Turn 25 (opponent acts then my turn): Purchase L2_61 → Score 6→8 prestige, gain GREEN+1 bonus (GREEN:2→3)
3. Turn 26+: With enhanced GREEN:3 bonus, pursue Level 3 prestige cards (L3_86 cost reduction: BLUE:7-2=5, GREEN:3-3=0, unlocking BLUE-only constraint path)

**STRATEGIC MOMENTUM:**
- L2_61 purchase immediately advances score 6→8 (+2 prestige)
- Opponent remains frozen at 1 prestige (5-point gap expands to insurmountable margin)
- GREEN:3 bonus enables future Level 3 card affordability (L3_86 +5 prestige becomes progressively cheaper)
- Victory path secured: 8 prestige by Turn 25, pathway to 15 prestige within 3-4 additional turns

**ALTERNATIVE REJECTION:**
- Excluding WHITE from token combination: Eliminates L2_61 path, forces slower accumulation toward L3 cards (requires 5+ more token accumulation turns for RED:5 constraint on L3_73)
- Reserving card instead: Delays prestige expansion without immediate prestige gain; incompatible with aggressive end-game acceleration
- Current combination maximizes prestige velocity while maintaining capacity efficiency

**CONCLUSION:**
WHITE:1 + BLUE:1 + RED:1 token taking reaches maximum safe capacity (10/10) while setting up guaranteed L2_61 purchase next turn, securing +2 prestige expansion and critical GREEN bonus upgrade for endgame Level 3 card acceleration. This maintains commanding position and guarantees victory within 2-3 additional turns. Opponent mathematically eliminated from prestige competition.

2026-01-01 13:27:03.397 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2). Available tokens on the board are RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:3 (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN are all 0).

**Taking Options:**
- Take 2 RED tokens: This gives me RED:2 (total tokens: 10/10). This directly advances my L2_70 goal (needs 6 RED, currently have 0 with bonuses covering 2, so need 4 more). Taking 2 RED reduces this to needing 2 more.
- Take 2 BLACK tokens: Would give me BLACK:3 (total: 10/10). Helps L2_48 which needs 3 BLACK.

**Why RED is Better:** L2_70 is a high-value 3-point card, and I currently have no RED tokens. The board shows RED:2 available now, and I need to collect 6 RED total. Taking 2 RED tokens now is more valuable than taking BLACK, as L2_70 is a prestige-generating card that will bring me closer to the 15-point win condition.

**Token Limit Check:** 8 current + 2 taking = 10 tokens, exactly at the limit. No need to return tokens.

**Final State:** WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (10 tokens). After this purchase, I'll have RED:2 which reduces my L2_70 requirement from 4 more to 2 more. Next turn I'll need to take either 3 different colors (if available) or 2 more RED if still available, to complete L2_70 and generate points.

**Alternative Considered:** Taking 2 BLACK would help L2_48, but L2_70 provides 3 prestige points vs L2_48's 1 point. Prioritizing RED accumulation for L2_70 is more strategically valuable for reaching 15 points.

2026-01-01 13:27:18.199 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2). Let me analyze my options:

**Token Taking:** Available tokens are WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:3. I can only take 3 tokens of different colors OR 2 tokens of the same color (if 4+ available). With only RED:2 and BLACK:2 on the board, I cannot take 2 of the same color (need 4+ available). I also cannot take 3 different colors because only 2 colors are available (RED and BLACK).

**Purchasing Options:**
- L1_28 costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 WHITE - I cannot afford (no WHITE on board to take)
- L1_1 costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED - I cannot afford
- L1_32 costs 4 BLACK - I have 3 BLACK total (1 + 2 bonus), need 1 more, cannot purchase
- L1_34 costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK - I cannot afford
- L2_56 costs 5 RED, 3 BLACK - I have 0 RED, cannot afford
- L2_45 costs 5 WHITE - I have 0 WHITE, cannot afford
- L2_61 costs 4 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 BLACK - I cannot afford
- L2_51 costs 5 BLUE - I have 2 BLUE, cannot afford

**Strategic Decision:** I notice Player 0 has L2_57 reserved! This is a LEVEL 2 card costing 5 RED that gives a WHITE bonus. It's not currently visible on the board (Player 0 must have reserved it). However, Player 0 hasn't purchased it yet.

I need to make progress toward my reserved cards:
- L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK (after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK)
- L2_70 needs 6 RED (after bonuses: 4 more RED)

Since I cannot take tokens or purchase cards, RESERVING L2_57 is my only viable action. I'll get 1 GOLD token which helps as a wildcard. This is a strategic move to accumulate gold for future purchases and deny Player 0 a potentially valuable card.

**Token Limit:** Current 8 tokens + 1 GOLD from reserve = 9 tokens, which is under the 10-token limit.

**Final State:** WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:3 with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2 and 3 reserved cards (L2_48, L2_70, L1_8, L2_57).

2026-01-01 13:27:29.011 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 6 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1). Looking at my reserved cards:
- L2_70 needs 4 more RED (after bonuses)
- L2_48 needs 2 more BLACK (after bonuses)
- L1_8 needs 3 more BLUE (after bonuses)

The board has RED:2 and BLACK:2 available. I can take 2 RED tokens (matching color, rule allows taking EXACTLY 2 tokens of the same color when 2+ available). This gives me:
- 2 RED tokens toward my L2_70 goal (need 4 total, will have 2 after this)
- Token count: 6 + 2 = 8 (under 10-token limit)

Alternative options:
- Taking 2 BLACK instead would give me 2 BLACK (need 2 for L2_48), but L2_70 is my higher priority since it gives 3 prestige points
- I cannot take 3 different colors (only RED and BLACK available on board)
- Purchasing L1_1 is affordable (all colors covered by bonuses + GOLD), but I want to save GOLD for when I'm closer to completing cards

Taking 2 RED tokens is optimal for working toward L2_70 completion. After this, I'll be at 8 tokens with RED:2, giving me flexibility to take BLACK or BLUE tokens next turn.

2026-01-01 13:28:02.070 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 25 - EXECUTE PLANNED L2_61 PURCHASE FOR PRESTIGE CONSOLIDATION

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- Tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 (10/10 CAPACITY - MAXED)
- Score: 6 prestige (commanding 5-point lead over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:3
- L2_61 AVAILABLE on board ✓

**L2_61 AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:**
Card: L2_61 | Base Cost: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, BLACK:1 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: GREEN+1

Effective Cost Calculation with my bonuses:
- WHITE: 4 - 1 (bonus) = 3 needed
- BLUE: 2 - 2 (bonus) = 0 needed
- BLACK: 1 - 2 (bonus) = 0 needed (BLACK bonus exceeds cost, no payment)

Payment Required: WHITE:3 ONLY
My Resources: WHITE:3 ✓
**STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓

**CRITICAL BOARD CONSTRAINT - TOKEN ACCUMULATION PATH BLOCKED:**
Board tokens available: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2
- Cannot take 3 different colors (no WHITE, BLUE, or GREEN available)
- RED:2 on board cannot be taken as 2 same-color (need 4+ on board)
- BLACK:2 on board cannot be taken as 2 same-color (need 4+ on board)
- VALID SAME-COLOR TAKES: NONE (both RED and BLACK below 4 threshold)
- Token accumulation path BLOCKED this turn
- Attempting to take tokens would be INVALID action

**OPTIMAL DECISION: EXECUTE PLANNED L2_61 PURCHASE**

1. **PRESTIGE EXPANSION (CRITICAL):**
   - Current: 6 prestige
   - After L2_61: 8 prestige
   - Opponent locked: 1 prestige (cannot afford any prestige cards)
   - **COMMANDING LEAD: 7-POINT MARGIN (8-1)**
   - This is mathematically insurmountable; opponent cannot recover

2. **CAPACITY LIBERATION FOR TURN 26 ACCUMULATION:**
   - Token cost: WHITE:3 only
   - Capacity after purchase: 10 - 3 = 7/10 (3 SLOTS FREED)
   - Next turn: Opponent acts, then I accumulate RED:2 + BLACK:2 (board limited) + explore refreshed cards
   - Frees flexibility for multi-card chains

3. **BONUS ENGINE CRITICAL UPGRADE:**
   - Gain GREEN:1 bonus → GREEN:3 total
   - Cumulative bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2
   - GREEN:3 UNLOCKS Level 3 prestige cards:
     * L3_86 (BLUE:7, GREEN:3 → effective cost becomes BLUE:7 with GREEN:3 bonus absorbed)
     * L3_73 (GREEN:3, RED:6, BLACK:3 → GREEN requirement fully covered by bonus)
     * L3_85 (WHITE:3, BLUE:6, GREEN:3 → GREEN requirement fully covered by bonus)
   - This is the CRITICAL UNLOCK for endgame prestige acceleration

4. **OPPONENT LOCKOUT PERMANENT:**
   - Opponent at 1 prestige (cannot afford L2_48, L2_70, or any Level 3 cards)
   - Opponent has RED:0 (blocks L2_70 path permanently)
   - No viable prestige path exists for opponent
   - 7-point lead guarantees victory

5. **TURN 26-27 ROADMAP ENABLED:**
   - Turn 26: Opponent takes limited board actions (RED/BLACK only, cannot form valid 3-color combo either)
   - My Turn 26: With 7/10 capacity, accumulate RED:2 + BLACK:2 (if valid board state allows) or prepare for Level 3 purchase chain
   - Turn 27+: Deploy Level 3 prestige cards (L3_86 +5, L3_73 +4, or others) with enhanced bonus efficiency
   - Victory trajectory: 8 prestige now → 12-13 by Turn 27 → 15 by Turn 28-29

**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS - NO ALTERNATIVE ACTION:**
- Cannot take tokens (no valid color combinations available)
- Cannot reserve card (wastes turn without prestige gain, already have 1 reserved card, capacity at maximum)
- ONLY viable action: Purchase L2_61

**CONCLUSION:**
L2_61 purchase is MANDATORY best move. It executes the Turn 24 plan flawlessly, secures +2 prestige (extending 6-1 to commanding 8-1 lead), unlocks critical GREEN:3 bonus for Level 3 card affordability, and eliminates all opponent recovery paths. With 7-point prestige lead and opponent mathematically frozen at 1 prestige, victory is secured. No alternative action provides equivalent strategic value.

2026-01-01 13:28:13.169 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2
- Reserved cards: L2_48 (needs 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK after bonuses), L2_70 (needs 4 RED), L1_8 (needs 3 BLUE)

**Token Analysis:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:3
- I need BLACK for L2_48. There are 2 BLACK available on the board.
- Rule: Take exactly 2 tokens of the same color (need 4+ available on board). Only 2 BLACK available, so I cannot take 2 of same color.
- Alternative: Take 3 tokens of different colors from available options (WHITE, RED, BLACK, GOLD)

**Optimal Action: Take 3 different tokens (WHITE, RED, BLACK)**
- WHITE: Available 3, useful for L1_1 or nobles later
- RED: Available 2, helps L2_70 (need 4 more RED)
- BLACK: Available 2, helps L2_48 (need 1 more BLACK)
- This combination gives me 1 of each needed color

**Token Limit Check:** 6 current + 3 taking = 9 tokens (under 10 limit, no returns needed)

**Final State:** WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (9 tokens)
- Closer to completing L2_48 (need 1 BLACK, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN)
- Positioned to take more RED tokens next turn for L2_70

**Why not purchase?**
- L1_1 costs 1 each of WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED. After bonuses, I need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED - only need GREEN, not worth spending
- L1_4 costs 1 GREEN, 3 RED, 1 BLACK - I have RED:0, cannot afford
- L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN - I have BLUE:2, cannot afford
- L1_32 costs 4 BLACK - I have BLACK:1 + GOLD:1, cannot afford

Taking 3 tokens is optimal for advancing toward my reserved cards.

2026-01-01 13:28:42.603 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens total (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2). I can take 2 more tokens without exceeding the 10-token limit.

**Board Analysis:** Available tokens are WHITE:3, RED:2, BLACK:2. GREEN and BLUE are 0, so I cannot take those colors.

**Rule Check:** I cannot take 2 tokens of the same color because the rule requires taking EXACTLY 2 tokens of the SAME color only when 4+ are available. Here, only 2 WHITE, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK are available.

**My Decision:** Take 3 DIFFERENT tokens: WHITE, RED, and BLACK.

- WHITE (1): Helps afford L1_1 (needs 1 WHITE) and builds toward nobles
- RED (1): Works toward L2_70 (needs 4 more RED after bonuses)
- BLACK (1): Helps toward L2_48 (needs 2 more BLACK after bonuses)

**Token Limit Check:** 8 current + 3 taking = 11 > 10. This would exceed the limit, so I need to set return_WHITE=1.

**Final State After This Turn:** WHITE:1 (took 1, returned 1), BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (total: 10 tokens)

**Positioning for Next Turn:** At 10 tokens, I'll be forced to purchase or reserve. I should be able to afford L1_1 (costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED → after bonuses: 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 0 RED) or use GOLD as wildcards. This move efficiently builds toward multiple goals.

**Goal Analysis:**
- L2_48 (reserved): Needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK → After bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK
- L2_70 (reserved): Needs 6 RED → After bonuses: 4 more RED
- L1_8 (reserved): Needs 4 BLUE

**My Strategy:** I need RED tokens for L2_70 and BLACK tokens for L2_48. I'll take 2 RED and 2 BLACK tokens from the board (both colors have 2+ available).

**Token Calculation:**
- Current: 8 tokens
- Taking: 2 RED + 2 BLACK = 4 tokens
- New total: 12 tokens → Need to return 2 tokens

**Tokens to Return:** WHITE and GREEN (least helpful for my reserved cards)

**Final State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:3, GOLD:2 (10 tokens)
- Progress: L2_70 now needs 2 more RED (was 4, now 2). L2_48 needs 2 more BLACK (was 2, now 2, plus bonus).

2026-01-01 13:30:27.512 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 26 - TOKEN ACCUMULATION TOWARD L3_86 PRESTIGE CARD

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 (7/10 capacity)
- Score: 8 prestige (commanding 7-point lead over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:3

**BOARD CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
BLUE:0 and GREEN:0 on board blocks any combination leveraging those colors. This forces me to select from available WHITE, RED, BLACK tokens only.

**VALID TOKEN COMBINATIONS AVAILABLE:**
1. WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 (3 different colors) ✓ OPTIMAL
2. Cannot take 2 same-color (RED:2 < 4, BLACK:2 < 4, WHITE:3 < 4)
3. Cannot form alternative 3-color combos (BLUE and GREEN unavailable)

**STRATEGIC PRIORITY: ACCUMULATE TOWARD L3_86**

Card: L3_86 | Base Cost: BLUE:7, GREEN:3 | Prestige: +5 | Bonus: GREEN

Effective Cost with my bonuses (BLUE:2, GREEN:3):
- BLUE: 7 - 2 = 5 needed
- GREEN: 3 - 3 = 0 needed
- Total: BLUE:5 only

Current BLUE tokens: 2
Shortfall: 3 tokens

Rationale:
- L3_86 is the highest single-card prestige value (+5) available
- Purchasing L3_86 would take me 8→13 prestige (only 2 more needed for victory)
- Current board has BLUE:0, so I cannot obtain BLUE tokens this turn
- By taking available colors (WHITE, RED, BLACK), I maintain token accumulation momentum
- Future turns will refresh the board with BLUE tokens; I'll be ready to take them

**CAPACITY ANALYSIS:**
- Current: 7/10 tokens
- Taking 3 tokens: +3
- Result: 7 + 3 = 10/10 (EXACTLY at maximum, no returns required)
- This maximizes my flexibility into Turn 27 (can reassess after opponent's action)

**OPPONENT STATUS CONFIRMATION:**
Opponent score: 1 prestige (still 7-point deficit from my 8)
- Opponent CAN purchase L2_48 reserved (effective cost BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1 → would reach 2 prestige)
- Even if opponent reaches 2 prestige next turn, my lead remains insurmountable (8-2 = 6-point margin)
- No viable prestige acceleration path for opponent (RED:0 blocks L2_70, no Level 3 affordability)

**TURN 27 ROADMAP:**
1. Opponent acts (likely takes tokens or purchases L2_48, both limiting their momentum)
2. My Turn 27: If board refreshes with BLUE tokens, immediately accumulate BLUE:3 + any other colors to reach BLUE:5+ total
3. Turn 27-28: Purchase L3_86 when BLUE:5 is achievable
4. Prestige: 8→13 (after L3_86), then secure +2 more for 15 (victory)

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- WHITE:3 available ≥ 1 ✓
- RED:2 available ≥ 1 ✓
- BLACK:2 available ≥ 1 ✓
- Valid 3-different-color combination ✓
- Capacity: 7 + 3 = 10/10 ≤ 10 ✓
- No token returns required ✓

**CONCLUSION:**
WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1 is the only viable action given board constraints (BLUE and GREEN depleted). This builds token reserves efficiently, reaches maximum safe capacity, and positions me for L3_86 acquisition once board refreshes bring BLUE tokens. With commanding 7-point prestige lead and opponent mathematically eliminated from acceleration paths, this move maintains victory trajectory toward 15 prestige within 2-3 additional turns.

2026-01-01 13:30:41.006 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm at 7 tokens and can take up to 3 more (7+3=10). The board has WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:3 available. BLUE and GREEN are 0 on the board, so I can't take those colors. Taking WHITE, RED, and BLACK is optimal because it positions me to potentially purchase L1_8 next turn (needs 4 BLUE but gives BLACK bonus which helps L2_48), and my BLACK bonus helps reduce the cost of BLACK-heavy cards like L1_8 and L2_48. Taking GOLD is less desirable since I already have 1 GOLD and it's a wildcard. After this, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (10 tokens) - ready to purchase or take tokens strategically next turn. My reserved L2_48 needs 2 BLACK more after bonuses, so accumulating BLACK tokens is valuable for my primary goal.

2026-01-01 13:30:51.336 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 8 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. My reserved cards need:
- L2_48: 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK → after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK
- L1_8: 4 BLUE
- L2_70: 6 RED → after bonuses: 4 RED

**Token Taking Analysis:** Available tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:3. I need GREEN for L2_48 but none are available. The best available tokens are WHITE and BLACK.

**Option 1 - Take WHITE and BLACK (2 tokens):**
- Would give me: WHITE:2, BLACK:2
- After taking: 8 + 2 = 10 tokens (at limit)
- Helps L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE) but doesn't directly help L2_48

**Option 2 - Take 3 different colors (WHITE, RED, BLACK):**
- Available: WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:1
- Would give me: WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:2
- After taking: 8 + 3 = 11 tokens → exceeds limit, need to return 1
- RED helps L2_70 which needs 4 more RED

**Chosen Option - Take WHITE, RED, BLACK:**
- Taking 3 different tokens maximizes utility given limited options
- RED helps L2_70 (needs 4 more RED after bonuses)
- WHITE and BLACK help build toward future purchases
- Need to return 1 token since 8 + 3 = 11 > 10

**Token Limit Management:** 8 current + 3 taking - 1 returning = 10 tokens (at limit)

**Final State:** WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:2 (10 tokens)

Taking 3 different colors (WHITE, RED, BLACK) is optimal because:
- WHITE advances my L1_8 goal (need 3 more BLUE, but WHITE helps with other purchases)
- RED advances L2_70 goal (need 4 more RED after bonuses)
- BLACK advances L2_48 goal (need 2 more BLACK after bonuses)

Taking 3 tokens: 8 + 3 = 11, so I'll return 1 token. I'll return a GOLD token since I have 2 GOLD and they'll be less useful than the colored tokens I need.

Final state: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (11 tokens, returning 1 to reach limit). This positions me closer to completing my reserved cards while staying under the 10-token limit by returning excess GOLD.

2026-01-01 13:32:21.837 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 27 - STRATEGIC PRESTIGE ADVANCEMENT VIA L2_55 PURCHASE

CURRENT STATE:
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:2 (10/10 CAPACITY - MAXED)
- Score: 8 prestige (commanding 7-point lead over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1

TOKEN TAKING ANALYSIS:
Board constraints eliminate all viable token taking:
- Cannot take 3 different colors (BLUE:0, GREEN:0 unavailable)
- Cannot take 2 same-color RED (board RED:1 < 4 minimum)
- Cannot take 2 same-color BLACK (board BLACK:1 < 4 minimum)
- At maximum capacity (10/10), any token taking would require returning 3 tokens (inefficient)
Result: Token taking wastes efficiency; card purchase is superior

AFFORDABLE CARDS VERIFICATION:

Level 1 prestige cards:
- L1_32: Cost BLACK:4 → Effective BLACK:2 (have BLACK:2) ✓ AFFORDABLE (+1 prestige)

Level 2 prestige cards:
- L2_55: Cost GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2
  - Effective cost: GREEN:1-3=0, RED:4-1=3, BLACK:2-2=0
  - Required: RED:3 only ✓ AFFORDABLE (+2 prestige, WHITE bonus)
- L2_56: Needs RED:4 (have RED:3) ✗
- L2_45: Needs WHITE:4 (have WHITE:1) ✗
- L2_51: Needs BLUE:3 (have BLUE:2) ✗

Level 3 prestige cards:
- L3_86: Needs BLUE:5 (have BLUE:2) ✗
- All others: NOT AFFORDABLE

L2_55 AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:
Card: L2_55 | Base Cost: GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:2 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: WHITE+1

Effective Cost with my bonuses (GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2):
- GREEN: 1 - 3 = 0 needed
- RED: 4 - 1 = 3 needed
- BLACK: 2 - 2 = 0 needed

Payment Required: RED:3 ONLY
My Resources: RED:3 ✓
STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE ✓

WHY L2_55 IS OPTIMAL:

1. **PRESTIGE ADVANCEMENT (CRITICAL):**
   - Current score: 8 prestige
   - After L2_55: 10 prestige
   - Remaining need: 5 prestige to reach 15 (victory)
   - Opponent frozen: 1 prestige (7-point gap becomes 9-point margin)
   - Victory path clearly visible: 10 → 15 via one L3 card purchase

2. **INVENTORY LIBERATION (ESSENTIAL):**
   - Token cost: RED:3
   - Capacity after: 10 - 3 = 7/10 (frees 3 slots)
   - Enables Turn 28+ free multi-color token accumulation
   - Critical for gathering BLUE:5 tokens needed for L3_86 (+5 prestige → direct victory)

3. **BONUS ENGINE UPGRADE:**
   - Gain WHITE:1 bonus → WHITE:2 total
   - New bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2
   - Enhanced flexibility for future Level 3 card purchases

4. **OPPONENT LOCKOUT PERMANENT:**
   - Opponent at 1 prestige with RED:0 tokens (permanently blocks L2_70 path)
   - Cannot achieve prestige acceleration in reasonable timeframe
   - Victory mathematically secured with 9-point lead

5. **VICTORY ROADMAP ENABLED:**
   - Turn 27 (current): Purchase L2_55 → 10 prestige, 7/10 capacity
   - Turn 28-29: Accumulate BLUE tokens over 2 turns (board refreshes will supply BLUE)
   - Turn 30: Purchase L3_86 when BLUE:5 accumulated → +5 prestige → 15 prestige = VICTORY

ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS:
- L1_32 purchase: Only +1 prestige (8→9), slower progression, frees only 2 slots
- L1_1 purchase: FREE but +0 prestige, wastes turn, frees 0 slots
- Token taking with returns: Efficiency loss, no prestige gain
- Reserving card: Delays prestige advance, incompatible with endgame acceleration

CONCLUSION:
L2_55 purchase is mandatory optimal move. It secures +2 prestige (8→10, only 5 away from 15), liberates 3 critical inventory slots for BLUE accumulation toward L3_86, and establishes clear 3-turn victory timeline. With commanding 9-point prestige lead and opponent permanently frozen at 1 prestige, this move guarantees victory by Turn 30. No alternative provides equivalent strategic value.

2026-01-01 13:32:35.925 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (7 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2
- Score: 1 point (opponent has 10 and is about to win!)
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:3

**Why Purchase L1_1:**
- Cost: 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED
- After bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2): I need only 1 BLACK (since I have bonuses for all costs except BLACK)
- I have BLACK:1 and GOLD:1 available to cover this

**Benefits:**
1. **Token Efficiency:** Reduces tokens from 7 to 6 (burns 1 token productively)
2. **BLACK Bonus:** Gets me to BLACK:3 bonus total
3. **Noble Path:** With BLACK:3, WHITE:1, BLUE:2, I'm close to N6 (3 BLACK, 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE) which is worth 3 points
4. **Score Push:** Gets me closer to 15 points while blocking opponent's win

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking tokens: Only 1 BLACK available, taking 1 token leaves me at 8 tokens without significant progress
- L1_28: Costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN - cannot afford (BLUE:0 on board)
- L1_32: Costs 4 BLACK - cannot afford
- L1_34: Costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK - need 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 0 BLACK (but only have 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE left)

**Final State:** Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:0 (6 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3. This puts me at BLACK:3, getting closer to the N6 noble (3 BLACK, 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE) for 3 prestige points.

2026-01-01 13:32:35.925 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=1, BLK=4}
2026-01-01 13:33:40.760 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 28 - CAPACITY LIBERATION + PRESTIGE CONSOLIDATION

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:2 (7/10 capacity)
- Score: 10 prestige (commanding 9-point lead over opponent's 1)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:3

**STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE: VICTORY WITHIN 3-4 TURNS**

I need 5 more prestige for victory (10→15). The only path is L3_86 (+5 prestige, costs BLUE:5 after bonuses). However, board currently has BLUE:0.

**CRITICAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:**

Token taking option (WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLACK:1):
- Would reach 10/10 capacity (maximum)
- Next turn if BLUE tokens appear, I'm capacity-locked and cannot take them
- Results in 1-turn delay in L3_86 accumulation path
- Suboptimal

**OPTIMAL ALTERNATIVE: PURCHASE L1_32 FOR IMMEDIATE BENEFITS**

Card: L1_32 | Base Cost: BLACK:4 | Prestige: +1 | Bonus: GREEN+1

Affordability with my bonuses (BLACK:2):
- BLACK: 4 - 2 = 2 needed
- My tokens: BLACK:2 ✓
**FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓

**TRIPLE WIN BENEFIT:**

1. **Prestige Progress:**
   - Current: 10 prestige
   - After purchase: 11 prestige
   - Remaining to victory: 4 (not 5)
   - Opponent gap: 11-1 = 10 points (insurmountable)

2. **Capacity Liberation (CRITICAL):**
   - Token cost: BLACK:2 only
   - Capacity after: 10 - 2 = 8/10 tokens (2 FREE SLOTS)
   - Turn 29+: Can immediately accumulate BLUE tokens when they appear on refreshed board
   - Eliminates capacity bottleneck that would delay L3_86 purchase by full turn

3. **Bonus Consolidation:**
   - Gain GREEN:1 bonus → GREEN:4 total
   - Enhanced L3 card flexibility for endgame scenarios

**FUTURE ROADMAP:**
- Turn 28 (now): Purchase L1_32 → 11 prestige, 8/10 capacity freed
- Turn 29: Opponent acts (locked at 1-2 prestige trajectory)
- Turn 29-30: Accumulate BLUE tokens when board refreshes (need BLUE:3 more to reach BLUE:5)
- Turn 31-32: Purchase L3_86 with BLUE:5 → +5 prestige → 16 total = VICTORY

Token-taking path costs 1-2 additional turns due to capacity lock. Purchasing L1_32 accelerates victory timeline and maintains endgame control.

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- L1_32 available on board ✓
- Cost fully affordable ✓
- No capacity issues post-purchase ✓

**CONCLUSION:**
L1_32 purchase is mandatory optimal move. It secures +1 prestige (maintaining 10-point lead), liberates 2 critical capacity slots for forthcoming BLUE accumulation, and accelerates L3_86 victory path by 1 turn. With opponent mathematically eliminated at 1 prestige, this move guarantees checkmate by Turn 32.

2026-01-01 13:34:07.675 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:2 (7 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3
- Score: 1 point (opponent has 11!)
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:3

**Strategy Analysis:**
My ultimate goal is to reach 15 points. The fastest path is visiting nobles. N6 requires BLACK:3, WHITE:3, BLUE:3 bonuses for 3 points. I have BLACK:3 already, so I need WHITE:2 and BLUE:2 more.

**Token Acquisition:**
- Taking 2 WHITE and 1 BLUE gives me WHITE:3 (1+2), BLUE:2 (1+1) total bonuses toward N6
- Taking WHITE and BLUE directly builds toward N6 while also helping L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)
- GREEN token helps L2_48 (needs 3 GREEN)

**Token Limit Check:**
- Current: 7 tokens
- After taking: 7 + 3 = 10 tokens (exactly at limit, no returns needed)

**Final State:** WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:2 (10 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3. Next turn I can visit N6 (requires 3 BLACK, 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE) for 3 points, bringing me to 4 points total. This noble-focused strategy is optimal for reaching 15 points quickly.

**Why not purchase/visit now:**
- L1_28 costs 3 BLUE but I have only 2 tokens after this turn
- L1_19 costs 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK - I don't have BLACK tokens and only 0 BLUE after spending
- I can't visit nobles yet (need WHITE:2 more, BLUE:2 more)

Taking tokens is the only viable move that makes progress toward both nobles and my reserved cards.

2026-01-01 13:34:18.411 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**

- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3
- Score: 1 point, opponent has 11 and is close to winning
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:3

**Token Limit Check:** 7 current + 3 taking = 10 tokens, which is exactly at the limit. No need to return tokens.

**Why Take 3 Different Colors (WHITE, GREEN, RED):**
1. **RED Priority:** L2_70 needs 6 RED (after bonuses: need 4 more). Taking RED advances this goal.
2. **GREEN Priority:** L2_48 needs 3 GREEN (after bonuses: need 2 more). Taking GREEN advances this goal.
3. **WHITE Priority:** L1_8 needs 4 BLUE and gives BLACK bonus. Taking WHITE is flexible.
4. **Token Efficiency:** With 7 tokens, taking 3 different colors is valid and doesn't exceed limit.

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking 2 of the same color: Not possible (only RED has 4+, but taking 2 RED only helps L2_70 partially)
- Purchasing cards: All visible cards cost BLUE or require BLUE which is 0 on board

**Final State After Taking:** WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (10 tokens). I'm now positioned with RED:1 to continue working toward L2_70, and GREEN:3 helps L2_48 completion. Next turn I'll need to purchase something to free up token space.

2026-01-01 13:34:39.605 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm at 7 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2.

**Why Reserve L2_57:**
- L2_57 costs 5 RED and gives a WHITE bonus
- After reserving: I get 1 GOLD token, bringing tokens to 8 total
- The WHITE bonus helps me work toward L2_45 (requires 5 WHITE), which I can purchase once I have more WHITE tokens
- L2_57 costs 5 RED, which matches my RED:2 bonus perfectly

**Token Limit:** 7 current + 1 gold from reserve = 8 tokens, under the 10-token limit

**Next Steps:** After this, I'll take 3 WHITE tokens (available on board) to work toward L2_45. My current WHITE bonus of 1 means I need 4 more WHITE tokens to complete L2_45 (5 total).

**Final State:** WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:3 (8 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2.

2026-01-01 13:36:02.272 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 29 - STRATEGIC PRESTIGE ACCELERATION VIA L2_51 RESERVATION

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0 (5/10 capacity)
- Score: 11 prestige (commanding 10-point lead, need 4 more for victory)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:3

**CRITICAL BOARD CONSTRAINT:**
BLUE:0 on board eliminates direct BLUE token acquisition this turn. This is a blocker for any BLUE-dependent prestige cards.

**PRESTIGE CARD AFFORDABILITY AUDIT:**

Level 2 prestige cards:
- L2_51: Base BLUE:5 → Effective cost after my BLUE:2 bonus = BLUE:3 needed
  * My tokens: BLUE:2 ✓ (SHORTAGE: 1 BLUE token only)
  * This is CRITICALLY CLOSE to affordability ← KEY DISCOVERY
- L2_56: Needs RED:4, BLACK:1 (have RED:0, BLACK:0) ✗
- L2_45: Needs WHITE:4 (have WHITE:1) ✗
- L2_58: Needs WHITE:6 (have WHITE:1) ✗

Level 3 prestige cards:
- L3_86: Needs BLUE:5 (have BLUE:2, need 3 more) ✗
- All others: NOT immediately affordable ✗

**OPTIMAL STRATEGY: RESERVE L2_51 FOR GUARANTEED NEXT-TURN PURCHASE**

Card: L2_51 | Base Cost: BLUE:5 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: BLUE+1

**L2_51 Purchase Path (Turn 30):**
1. Reserve L2_51 now (Turn 29) → Receive 1 GOLD token
2. My tokens at Turn 30 start: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1
3. L2_51 payment method: BLUE:2 (tokens) + GOLD:1 (substitute for missing BLUE) = BLUE:3 cost covered ✓
4. Result: +2 prestige (11→13), gain BLUE+1 bonus (BLUE:2→3)

**WHY THIS IS SUPERIOR TO TAKING TOKENS:**

1. **TIME EFFICIENCY (CRITICAL):**
   - Alternative: Take RED:2 this turn, wait for BLUE tokens to appear on board, accumulate BLUE:3 over 1-2 future turns, THEN purchase L2_51
   - Current path: Guarantee L2_51 purchase next turn using GOLD substitution
   - TIME SAVED: 1-2 turns

2. **GUARANTEED PROGRESSION:**
   - GOLD tokens are confirmed available on board (3 GOLD showing)
   - GOLD can substitute any color (confirmed game rule)
   - L2_51 payment guaranteed next turn; not dependent on board refreshes

3. **BONUS ENGINE CRITICAL UPGRADE:**
   - Current BLUE bonus: 2
   - After L2_51 purchase: BLUE:3
   - Impact on L3_86 (the win path):
     * L3_86 base: BLUE:7, GREEN:3
     * After my bonus BLUE:2 (current): need BLUE:5
     * After purchase (BLUE:3): need BLUE:7-3=BLUE:4
     * Reduces required accumulation by 1 token

4. **RESERVED CARD CAPACITY:**
   - Current reserved: 1 card (L2_57)
   - Max allowed: 3 cards per player
   - Reserving L2_51: 2 of 3 used, still room for flexibility

5. **IMMEDIATE PRESTIGE ADVANCEMENT:**
   - Current: 11 prestige
   - After L2_51: 13 prestige (only 2 away from 15 victory)
   - Opponent status: 1 prestige (permanently frozen; cannot afford prestige cards)
   - Lead expands from 10 points to 12 points (insurmountable)

**VICTORY ROADMAP ENABLED:**
- Turn 29 (now): Reserve L2_51 → gain GOLD:1
- Turn 30: Purchase L2_51 → Score 11→13, BLUE bonus upgraded
- Turn 31-32: Accumulate BLUE:2-3 tokens from refreshed board (board will show BLUE)
- Turn 32-33: Purchase L3_86 with BLUE:4 (after new bonus) → +5 prestige → Score 18 (victory confirmed)

**OPPONENT LOCKOUT ANALYSIS:**
Opponent at 1 prestige. Cannot threaten victory path:
- Best available: L2_48 reserved (only +1 prestige, would reach 2)
- Opponent would need 15 turns minimum to match my 15; I win in 3
- Already mathematically eliminated from competition

**ALTERNATIVE REJECTION:**
- Take RED:2: Accumulates tokens but delays L2_51 by 1-2 turns, no immediate prestige gain
- Take WHITE:1+RED:1+BLACK:1: Similar inefficiency; doesn't solve BLUE shortage
- Purchase L1 cards: Zero prestige value, wastes turn

**BOARD VERIFICATION:**
- L2_51 available on face-up board ✓
- GOLD:3 available on board ✓
- Can reserve (3 slots max, only 1 used) ✓
- No conflicts with game rules ✓

**CONCLUSION:**
Reserving L2_51 is MANDATORY optimal move. It secures guaranteed +2 prestige next turn using GOLD substitution (bypassing BLUE:0 board constraint), upgrades BLUE bonus to enable future L3 prestige cards, and reduces victory timeline from 4+ turns to 2 turns. With commanding 10-point prestige lead and opponent mathematically frozen at 1 prestige, this move accelerates checkmate to Turn 32-33. No alternative action provides equivalent strategic velocity.

2026-01-01 13:36:02.272 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=2}
2026-01-01 13:36:23.831 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (8 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3
- Score: 1 point (opponent has 11!)
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 GREEN after bonuses), L2_70 (needs 4 RED after bonuses), L1_8 (needs 3 BLUE after bonuses)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:2

**Critical Observation:**
- BLUE and GREEN are both 0 on the board - I cannot take these colors!
- I must work with what's available: WHITE, RED, BLACK

**Why Take 2 BLACK Tokens:**
1. **L2_45 Strategy:** L2_45 costs 5 WHITE and gives BLACK bonus (2 points). With 5 GOLD (including those I'll have), I can substitute for WHITE tokens. This is a high-value purchase!
2. **After taking 2 BLACK:** I'll have BLACK:3 bonus total
3. **Positioning:** With WHITE:1, BLACK:3 bonus, and 5 GOLD available for substitution, I can potentially purchase L2_45 once I gather more WHITE tokens
4. **Token Limit:** 8 current + 2 taking = 10 tokens (exactly at limit, no returns needed)

**Alternative Options Checked:**
- Taking 2 RED: Would give me RED:2, but L2_70 needs 6 RED (way off)
- Taking 2 WHITE: Would give me WHITE:3, but still far from L2_45's 5 WHITE requirement
- Purchasing L1_25 (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK for GREEN bonus): Would cost me GOLD:1 and reduce tokens to 7, but doesn't advance my high-value purchase goals as effectively as hoarding for L2_45
- Reserve from deck: Only gives 1 GOLD, no benefit this turn

**Final State:** WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:3, GOLD:2 (10 tokens). I'm now positioned to purchase L2_45 once I can gather 4 more WHITE tokens (substituting with GOLD as needed). The BLACK bonus also gets me closer to the N6 noble (3 BLACK, 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE) for 3 points.

2026-01-01 13:36:42.417 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (8 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)
- Score: 1 point

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:2

**Why Purchase L1_34:**
- Cost: 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK
- After bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3): I need 1 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 0 BLACK
- I have WHITE:1 and GOLD:2 available to cover this

**Benefits:**
1. **Token Efficiency:** Reduces tokens from 8 to 6 (burns 2 tokens productively)
2. **RED Bonus:** Gets me to RED:3 bonus total
3. **Goal Alignment:** With RED:3 bonus and having 4 RED available on the board, I'm now closer to completing L2_70 which needs 6 RED (after bonuses: 3 more needed with RED:3)
4. **Score Push:** Gets me to 2 points while working toward the 15-point goal

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking tokens: BLUE:0, GREEN:0, so I can only take from RED, WHITE, BLACK. Taking 3 tokens (RED, WHITE, BLACK) would give me 10 tokens and position for L2_70 but doesn't give immediate progress
- L1_25 costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED - gives GREEN bonus but doesn't help L2_70 as much as L1_34's RED bonus
- L1_19 costs 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK - cannot afford (BLUE:0 on board)
- L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN - cannot afford (BLUE:0 on board)

**Final State:** Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3. This gives me RED:3 bonus, putting me on track to complete L2_70 which needs 6 RED (3 more needed after bonuses).

2026-01-01 13:37:20.722 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 30 - EXECUTE L2_51 PURCHASE FOR PRESTIGE ACCELERATION

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (6/10 capacity)
- Score: 11 prestige (need 4 more for victory at 15)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:2
- L2_51 RESERVED in hand ✓

**L2_51 RESERVED-PURCHASE AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:**
Card: L2_51 | Base Cost: BLUE:5 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: BLUE+1

Effective Cost Calculation with my bonuses (BLUE:2):
- BLUE: 5 - 2 (bonus) = 3 needed

Payment Method:
- BLUE tokens available: 2
- GOLD tokens available: 1 (can substitute for any color per rules)
- Total payment: BLUE:2 (tokens) + GOLD:1 (substitute for BLUE) = BLUE:3 ✓

**STATUS: FULLY AFFORDABLE** ✓

**OPTIMAL DECISION: EXECUTE L2_51 RESERVED-CARD PURCHASE**

1. **PRESTIGE BREAKTHROUGH (CRITICAL):**
   - Current: 11 prestige
   - After L2_51: 13 prestige
   - Remaining to victory: 2 prestige (EXTREMELY CLOSE)
   - Opponent locked: 1 prestige (12-point margin insurmountable)
   - Victory timeline: 2 turns maximum from now

2. **CAPACITY LIBERATION (ESSENTIAL):**
   - Token cost: BLUE:2 + GOLD:1 (total 3 tokens consumed)
   - Capacity after: 6 - 3 = 3 tokens (7 SLOTS FREED)
   - Unlimited accumulation capacity for future BLUE tokens
   - Critical flexibility for Turn 31-32 token gathering

3. **BONUS ENGINE CRITICAL UPGRADE:**
   - Current BLUE bonus: 2 → After: BLUE:3
   - New bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:2
   - Impact on L3_86 (final victory card, cost BLUE:7, GREEN:3):
     * Current effective need: BLUE:7-2=BLUE:5, GREEN:3-4=0
     * After upgrade: BLUE:7-3=BLUE:4, GREEN:3-4=0
     * **BLUE requirement REDUCED FROM 5 TO 4** ← Victory acceleration
     * Combined with GREEN:4 bonus, eliminates GREEN cost entirely

4. **VICTORY ROADMAP ENABLED:**
   - Turn 30 (now): Purchase L2_51 → Score 11→13, BLUE:3 bonus, 3/10 capacity freed
   - Turn 31: Opponent acts (cannot threaten 1 prestige)
   - Turn 31-32: Accumulate BLUE tokens when board refreshes (need 4 total)
   - Turn 33: Purchase L3_86 with BLUE:4 → Score 13→18 = **VICTORY** (15 reached)

5. **OPPONENT LOCKOUT PERMANENT:**
   - Opponent score: 1 prestige (2 points below purchase threshold for any remaining prestige cards)
   - Best path: L2_48 reserved (costs BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:3 effective = only reaches +1 prestige to score 2)
   - No viable prestige acceleration exists
   - 12-point margin mathematically unrecoverable in remaining turns
   - Victory secured regardless of opponent actions

**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS - TOKEN TAKING SUBOPTIMAL:**
- Board: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3
- Cannot take 3 different colors (BLUE:0, GREEN:0 unavailable)
- Taking RED:2 or BLACK:2 adds tokens but delays prestige by 1 turn
- L2_51 purchase converts GOLD into prestige immediately
- Efficiency: Prestige now > Token accumulation

**ALTERNATIVE REJECTION:**
- Take RED:2 only: Invalid (need 3 different or 2 same-color from 4+) ✗
- Take WHITE:1+RED:1+BLACK:1: Valid but delays prestige by 1-2 turns ✗
- Reserve another card: Delays L2_51 by 1+ turns, suboptimal ✗
- Purchase non-prestige L1 cards: Zero prestige value, wasted turn ✗

**CONCLUSION:**
L2_51 reserved-card purchase is MANDATORY optimal move. It converts TUR 29's reservation into prestige advancement (11→13), upgrades BLUE bonus to accelerate L3_86 victory path (4 tokens instead of 5), and guarantees checkmate by Turn 33. GOLD token substitution eliminates board token constraints completely. With commanding 12-point prestige lead and opponent permanently frozen at 1 prestige, this move seals certain victory within 2 turns. No alternative provides equivalent strategic value or efficiency.

- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (7 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)
- Score: 1 point (opponent has 13 points and is about to win!)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:3

**Taking Tokens Analysis:**
- Available colors to take: WHITE, BLUE, RED, BLACK (GREEN:0 unavailable)
- I have 7 tokens, so I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10-token limit
- I need to work toward L1_19 (costs 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK) which I can afford if I get 1 more BLACK
- L1_16 costs 4 RED (with RED:3 bonus, need 1 more RED) - good point option
- L1_25 costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK - gives GREEN bonus

**Strategic Move: Take 2 BLACK and 1 WHITE**
- This gives me: BLACK:3 total, WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, GOLD:2 (10 tokens)
- With BLACK:3 bonus + BLACK tokens, I can afford L1_19 next turn (needs 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK)
- BLACK helps L2_48 which needs 3 BLACK (after bonuses: need 1 more)
- WHITE is needed for multiple cards

**Alternative Options:**
- Take 2 WHITE, 1 BLACK: Gets me closer to L1_25 (needs 1 WHITE)
- Take 2 RED, 1 WHITE: Gets me closer to L1_16 (needs 1 RED with RED:3 bonus)
- Reserve L1_16: Gets gold but opponent has 13 pts - no time for reserves!
- Buy L1_25: Can't afford (no WHITE, no RED, no BLACK left)

**Final State After Taking:** Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:3, GOLD:2 (10 tokens). Ready to purchase L1_19 next turn for GREEN bonus + point progress toward L2_48 completion.

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:3

**Why Purchase L1_16:**
- Cost: 4 RED
- After bonuses (RED:3 bonus): I need only 1 RED
- I have BLACK:1 and GOLD:1 available to cover this (BLACK substitutes for RED)

**Benefits:**
1. **Token Efficiency:** Reduces tokens from 6 to 5 (burns 1 token productively)
2. **BLUE Bonus:** Gets me to BLUE:2 bonus total
3. **Score Push:** Gets me to 2 points, getting closer to 15
4. **Positioning:** With 5 tokens after purchase, I'll be able to take 3 tokens next turn (WHITE, BLUE, BLACK) to work toward L1_8 completion

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking tokens: GREEN:0 on board, so I can only take from WHITE, BLUE, RED, BLACK. Taking 3 tokens (WHITE, BLUE, BLACK) would give me 9 tokens and work toward L1_8 but doesn't give immediate progress
- L1_28: Costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN - need 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 0 GREEN (have BLUE:2, but need 3 BLUE total)
- L1_25: Costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK - need 1 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 1 RED, 0 BLACK (cannot afford, need 1 WHITE and 1 RED)
- L1_19: Costs 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK - need 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 0 BLACK (cannot afford, only have BLUE:2)

**Final State:** Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (5 tokens) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3. Score: 2 points. This gives me BLUE:2 bonus and 2 points total, positioning me to take 3 tokens next turn to work toward L1_8 completion.

2026-01-01 13:38:51.861 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 31 - FINAL VICTORY PATH VIA L2_43 ACQUISITION

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0 (3/10 capacity)
- Score: 13 prestige (need 2 more for victory at 15)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Opponent: 2 prestige (11-point deficit, mathematically eliminated)

**CRITICAL PRESTIGE CARD ANALYSIS: L2_43**

Card: L2_43 | Base Cost: BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: BLACK+1

Effective Cost Calculation with my bonuses:
- BLUE: 1 - 3 (bonus) = 0 needed (fully covered)
- GREEN: 4 - 4 (bonus) = 0 needed (fully covered)
- RED: 2 - 1 (bonus) = 1 needed

**PAYMENT REQUIREMENT: RED:1 ONLY**

Current tokens: RED:0 (1 token SHORT for immediate purchase)

**TWO-TURN VICTORY EXECUTION PLAN:**

**TURN 31 (NOW): Take WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLUE:1**
- Board availability: WHITE:3 ✓, BLUE:2 ✓, RED:4 ✓
- Valid combination: 3 different colors ✓
- Capacity math: 3 current + 3 taking = 6/10 ≤ 10 ✓
- Result tokens after: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0
- Tokens contain RED:1 needed for L2_43 purchase ✓

**TURN 32: Purchase L2_43**
- Payment: RED:1 token
- Prestige gained: +2
- Final score: 13 + 2 = 15 = **VICTORY** ✓

**WHY THIS IS OPTIMAL:**

1. **GUARANTEED VICTORY WITHIN 1 TURN:**
   - Clearest, fastest path to 15 prestige
   - No dependence on future board refreshes
   - Opponent frozen at 2 prestige (cannot threaten victory in next turn)
   - Victory CONFIRMED Turn 32, no variance possible

2. **ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS (ALL SUBOPTIMAL):**
   - L3_86 path: Needs BLUE:4, currently BLUE:0, requires 2+ additional turns to accumulate ✗
   - L3_85, L3_73, L3_76: All require multiple tokens I lack ✗
   - Nobles N8/N6/N5: Require 3+ tokens across multiple colors not available ✗
   - Reserved L2_57: Needs RED:4, effective (have RED:0) ✗

3. **BOARD TOKEN VERIFICATION:**
   - WHITE:3 available ≥ 1 needed ✓
   - RED:4 available ≥ 1 needed ✓
   - BLUE:2 available ≥ 1 needed ✓
   - Valid 3-different-color combination ✓
   - No capacity constraints (6/10 final ≤ 10) ✓
   - No token returns required ✓

4. **OPPONENT LOCKOUT PERMANENT:**
   - Score: 2 prestige (13 points behind)
   - Reserved best card: L2_70 costs RED:6 → effective RED:3 after RED:3 bonus
   - Opponent has RED:0 tokens → cannot afford L2_70 immediately
   - Cannot reach 15 prestige in single turn (best +3 from L2_70)
   - 11-point margin mathematically insurmountable in remaining timeframe

**CONCLUSION:**
Taking WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLUE:1 is the MANDATORY optimal move. This secures RED:1 token required to purchase L2_43 on Turn 32, converting 13→15 prestige for VICTORY. With commanding 11-point lead and opponent permanently locked at 2 prestige, this move guarantees checkmate within 1 additional turn. No alternative provides equivalent strategic efficiency or certainty.

2026-01-01 13:39:08.084 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (5 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3
- Score: 2 points (opponent has 13 and is winning!)
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:4

**Purchase Analysis (L1_25):**
- Cost: 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK
- After bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3): Need 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 0 RED, 0 BLACK
- FREE PURCHASE! I have enough bonuses to cover all costs

**Why L1_25 is Optimal:**
1. **Zero Token Cost:** My bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:3, BLACK:3) perfectly cover the costs
2. **Score Push:** Gets me to 3 points, moving closer to 15
3. **GREEN Bonus:** Gets me to GREEN:2 bonus total
4. **Positioning:** Reduces tokens from 5 to 0, allowing me to take 3 tokens next turn
5. **Goal Alignment:** GREEN:2 bonus helps L2_48 which needs 3 GREEN

**Alternative Options:**
- L1_13 costs 1 WHITE, 2 BLACK - affordable (need 0 WHITE, 0 BLACK after bonuses) but gives BLUE bonus instead of GREEN
- L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN - cannot afford (need 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN after bonuses, but only have 0 WHITE)
- Taking tokens: Only 1 BLUE available on board, taking 1 token leaves me at 6 tokens without immediate progress

**Noble Strategy:**
- N6 (3 BLACK, 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE) requires me to have tokens for WHITE and BLUE
- With L1_25 giving GREEN:2, I'm closer to L2_48 completion which needs 3 GREEN
- After this purchase, I can take WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK tokens to work toward N6

**Final State:** Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 (same total, rearranged) with bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:3. Score: 3 points. I'll take 3 tokens next turn (WHITE, BLUE, BLACK) to work toward N6 noble and L1_8 completion.

2026-01-01 13:39:37.865 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: TURN 32 - VICTORY EXECUTION VIA L2_43 PURCHASE

**CURRENT STATE VERIFICATION:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0 (6/10 capacity)
- Score: 13 prestige (need 2 more for victory at 15)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Opponent: 2 prestige (frozen, mathematically eliminated)

**BOARD STATE:**
- Face-up L2_43 available ✓
- Available tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:3, GOLD:4

**L2_43 FINAL AFFORDABILITY VERIFICATION:**

Card: L2_43 | Base Cost: BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2 | Prestige: +2 | Bonus: BLACK+1

Effective Cost with my bonuses (BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:1):
- BLUE: 1 - 3 = 0 needed (FULLY COVERED by bonus)
- GREEN: 4 - 4 = 0 needed (FULLY COVERED by bonus)
- RED: 2 - 1 = 1 needed (EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE)

**PAYMENT REQUIREMENT: RED:1 ONLY**
My tokens: RED:1 ✓ FULLY AFFORDABLE

**VICTORY CALCULATION:**
- Current prestige: 13
- L2_43 prestige gain: +2
- Final prestige: 13 + 2 = 15 = **VICTORY THRESHOLD MET** ✅

**EXECUTION:**
1. Purchase L2_43 with RED:1 token
2. Score advances from 13 → 15 prestige
3. Game terminates with Player 0 victory (15 vs opponent's 2)

**WHY THIS IS CHECKMATE:**
- Turn 31 (executed): Took WHITE:1 + RED:1 + BLUE:1 successfully
- Turn 32 (now): L2_43 purchase converts RED:1 into +2 prestige
- Opponent at turn 32: Cannot possibly reach 15 prestige (currently 2, would need +13)
- Victory confirmed regardless of opponent's remaining turns

**ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS (IRRELEVANT - VICTORY GUARANTEED):**
- L3_86 path: Requires BLUE:4 after bonuses, only have BLUE:1, would take 2-3 turns
- L3 cards: All require resources not currently available
- Nobles N8/N6/N5: Require 3 exact gem count (not bonuses), none met
- Any other purchase: Wastes turn when victory is available now

**CONCLUSION:**
Purchasing L2_43 is the MANDATORY winning move. It converts RED:1 token into +2 prestige (13→15), achieving VICTORY immediately. With commanding 11-point prestige lead and opponent permanently locked at 2 prestige, this move conclusively terminates the game with Player 0 victory. This is checkmate. Execution guaranteed success.

2026-01-01 13:40:01.424 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Critical Situation:** Opponent has 15 points and already won! I need to make a move. Let me analyze my options efficiently.

**My Current State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens)
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:3
- Score: 3 points
- Reserved: L2_48 (BLUE bonus), L2_70 (RED bonus), L1_8 (BLACK bonus)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:4

**Strategic Decision:**
The game is effectively over since opponent won, but I need to make a move. I'll reserve L2_58 (6 WHITE, 3 prestige points) because:
1. It's the highest prestige card on the board (3 pts)
2. I have a GOLD token to take with this action
3. L2_58's WHITE bonus (3 total) will help me complete future WHITE-heavy cards

**Token Calculation:**
- Current: 6 tokens + 1 GOLD from reserve = 7 tokens total
- After taking WHITE: 8 tokens (below 10, no return needed)

This positions me to potentially take 2 more tokens next turn (BLUE, BLACK) to work toward future purchases.

2026-01-01 13:40:01.424 [main] WARN  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot reserve more than 3 cards.
2026-01-01 13:40:30.357 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1). I cannot purchase any board cards due to lacking WHITE tokens which most affordable cards require. I also cannot reserve a card because I already have 3 reserved cards (L2_48, L2_70, L1_8). Therefore, my only legal action is to take tokens.

**Token Strategy:**
- GREEN:0 on board, BLUE:1 available, RED:4 available
- Taking 2 GREEN is impossible (only 0 available)
- I must take 3 different colors
- Available options: WHITE (2), BLUE (1), RED (4), BLACK (3), GOLD (4)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:3
- L2_48 needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK → after bonuses: 0 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 0 BLACK
- L1_8 needs 4 BLUE → after bonuses: 2 BLUE

**Why GREEN, BLUE, RED?**
- GREEN: Critical for L2_48 completion (need 2 more after bonuses)
- BLUE: Critical for L1_8 completion (need 2 more after bonuses)
- RED: Helps build toward L2_70 which needs 6 RED (after bonuses: need 3 more)

This leaves me at 9 tokens, positioning me to complete either L1_8 or L2_48 on my next turn.

2026-01-01 13:40:45.933 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- My tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens total)
- My bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:3
- Score: 3 points (opponent has 15 and won!)
- Reserved: L2_48 (needs 2 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLACK), L2_70 (needs 6 RED), L1_8 (needs 4 BLUE)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:3, GOLD:4

**Token Acquisition Strategy:**
- I need to take exactly 3 tokens (either 3 different colors OR 2 of the same color)
- L2_70 needs 6 RED (after bonuses: 3 more needed with RED:3 bonus)
- L1_8 needs 4 BLUE (after bonuses: 2 more needed with BLUE:2 bonus)
- L1_39 costs 3 WHITE and gives RED bonus

**Why Take RED, BLACK, WHITE:**
1. **Goal Alignment:** After taking these tokens, I'll have WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
2. **L1_39 Purchase:** This will allow me to purchase L1_39 next turn (cost: 3 WHITE, need 2 more WHITE after taking)
3. **L2_70 Progress:** RED tokens help me work toward L2_70 (needs 6 RED total)
4. **Token Efficiency:** Taking 3 different colors is valid and positions me for future purchases

**Alternative Options:**
- Taking 2 RED: Only 4 RED available, but taking 2 doesn't help L1_39
- Taking BLUE, RED, BLACK: BLUE:1 only, doesn't work toward L1_39
- Taking WHITE, RED, BLACK: Best option as it positions me for L1_39 purchase

**Final State After Taking:** WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 (9 tokens total). This positions me to take 1 more WHITE next turn to purchase L1_39 for a RED bonus, getting closer to L2_70 completion.
