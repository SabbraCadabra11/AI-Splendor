2026-01-01 12:33:40.853 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 1 priority is to lock in an efficient early scoring target and deny it to the opponent. L2_69 is a strong 2-prestige card with a single-color cost (5 BLACK), making it straightforward to plan around, and reserving it immediately also grants a GOLD token to accelerate the eventual purchase. This sets a clear path: accumulate BLACK tokens (and/or additional GOLD later) to cash in 2 points quickly while developing the engine afterward.

Evaluating level 1 cards: L1_17 costs {BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1} and gives WHITE bonus. Taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED tokens positions me to acquire this balanced card next turn with a single BLACK token. These three colors also align with noble N9 (requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3 for 3 prestige points). The opponent reserved L2_69 needing BLACK:5, so avoiding BLACK tokens now reduces direct competition while I build my engine. No returns needed as I'm far under the 10-token limit. This provides maximum flexibility for future purchases and noble alignment.

2026-01-01 12:37:57.810 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (3 tokens). I cannot purchase any cards yet as L1_17 (cost BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) is the most accessible but I'm missing BLACK. The opponent (Player 0) has reserved L2_69 costing BLACK:5 and currently holds BLACK:2 tokens, so they need 3 more black. Taking BLACK tokens now will disrupt their strategy. I also need to build towards noble N9 (requires GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3) and N10 (requires RED:3, WHITE:3, BLACK:3), so acquiring RED and WHITE is valuable. Taking GREEN instead of BLACK would avoid competing for black but would slow my ability to purchase L1_17 and wouldn't hinder the opponent. By taking BLACK:1, I both position myself to buy L1_17 next turn and starve the opponent of a critical resource they need. Taking WHITE and RED helps build towards future nobles and cards. Total tokens after taking: 6 (under 10), no returns needed. This maximizes resource gain while disrupting opponent's engine.

2026-01-01 12:41:07.422 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current analysis: I have BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (3 tokens total). The opponent reserved L2_69 (needs BLACK:5) and has BLACK:2, so they're competing for black tokens. I can reach 6 tokens this turn (under the 10 limit, no returns needed). 

My best target is L1_17 (cost: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, gives WHITE bonus). I already have BLUE, GREEN, and RED covered. I only need BLACK:1 to purchase it next turn.

Token selection strategy:
1. **BLACK**: Take 1 black token to complete L1_17's cost. This also reduces board supply to 1, hindering opponent's L2_69 acquisition.
2. **WHITE**: Take 1 white token to progress toward noble N10 (needs WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3) and help afford cards like L1_34.
3. **BLUE**: Take 1 blue token to reach 2 blues toward noble N9 (needs BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3).

After this move I'll have: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1 (6 tokens total). Next turn I can purchase L1_17 using 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK, gaining a WHITE bonus. This efficiently builds my engine while interfering with the opponent's strategy. This is a valid 3-different-colors take action.

Purchasing this card now is optimal because: 1) It gives me a permanent WHITE bonus, progressing toward noble N10 (WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:3), 2) It frees up 4 token slots (from 6 to 2 tokens total), allowing me to take up to 8 more tokens on future turns without returns, 3) It prevents the opponent from acquiring this useful card, 4) It costs no gold tokens, and 5) Taking tokens instead would be a wasted turn when I can immediately build my engine. After purchase, I'll have WHITE:1 and BLUE:1 tokens remaining, with a new WHITE bonus of 1. The opponent is focusing on black tokens for their reserved L2_69, and removing this card from the board while consolidating my position is the most efficient path to 15 points.

2026-01-01 12:44:05.231 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are 1 payment short of buying our reserved L2_69 (cost 5 BLACK): we currently have 2 BLACK + 2 GOLD (=4). Taking tokens can’t gain GOLD, and BLACK is too low in the bank to take 2-of-a-kind, so the most efficient way to enable the purchase next turn is to reserve a card and gain +1 GOLD (gold supply is available). 

Reserving a high-impact LEVEL_3 card also doubles as denial. L3_72 is a 4-prestige card with a simple RED-only cost (RED 7), which synergizes with the RED bonus we’ll get from L2_69, and it’s valuable to keep away from the opponent. After this reserve, we’ll have 3 GOLD total, letting us purchase L2_69 next turn with 2 BLACK + 3 GOLD. No token return is needed (we’ll have 5 tokens total).

2026-01-01 12:49:45.254 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 2 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1) and 1 WHITE bonus from purchased card L1_17. The opponent has 2 prestige points and is targeting black tokens for their reserved L2_69. I need to build my engine efficiently while blocking opponent progression.

Strategic evaluation: L1_34 (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) is an ideal target - it gives RED bonus which helps toward all three nobles (N9, N10, N7). I already have BLUE:1 token. Taking WHITE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 this turn allows me to purchase L1_34 next turn using exactly those tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1), gaining a RED bonus. This blocks opponent from acquiring a useful card and builds toward noble N9 (GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3) and N10 (RED:3, WHITE:3, BLACK:3). Taking BLACK also reduces board supply to 3, further hindering opponent's L2_69 acquisition. I remain at 4 tokens total (well under 10), so no returns needed.

This is superior to reserving because the opponent cannot afford L1_34 anyway, and taking tokens maintains momentum toward immediate purchase. The 3-different-colors take action is valid and maximizes board impact while setting up my next scoring opportunity.

L2_50 (2 prestige, BLUE bonus) is the best near-term target because our existing RED bonus reduces its RED cost to 0, leaving a relatively manageable remaining cost (WHITE+BLACK). Reserving it now both locks in those 2 points and gives us a GOLD token, which is especially valuable because BLACK tokens are scarce in the bank (only 3, so we can’t take 2-of-a-kind). This sets up an efficient path to buy L2_50 soon using GOLD as a BLACK substitute if needed.

Since we’re already at the 3-card reserve limit, the best tempo is to take 3 different tokens that (a) advance our easiest near-term purchase (reserved L1_14 needs GREEN/BLACK) and (b) secure scarce resources for our key 2‑prestige reserved L2_50 (needs WHITE/BLACK after our RED bonus removes its RED cost). WHITE is down to 1 in the bank, so taking it now ensures we have at least one for L2_50. We also take GREEN + BLACK to start building toward buying L1_14 soon (which will free a reserve slot for future GOLD via reserving). Token total goes from 1 to 4, so no returns are needed.

After using 2 WHITE tokens (leaving WHITE:1), plus BLUE:1, GREEN:1, and BLACK:1, I will have WHITE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 remaining and gain a RED bonus. This is optimal because: 1) I immediately acquire RED bonus which helps toward all three nobles (N9, N10, N7), 2) I remove a useful card from the board before opponent can target it, 3) I free up token slots from 8 to 6, enabling larger future draws without returns, 4) I prevent token waste by converting tokens into permanent bonuses, and 5) The opponent currently has 2 prestige points from L2_69, and this keeps me competitive while building my engine. L1_34 costs exactly what I can afford now, and delaying would mean missing a scoring opportunity while opponent continues gaining points.

2026-01-01 12:55:03.365 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 0 prestige points while opponent has 2. I have 4 tokens (WHITE:2, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) with bonuses WHITE:1, RED:1. White tokens are scarce on board (0 available), so I should conserve my white tokens for high-value purchases rather than spending them on 0-point cards like L1_39. 

Strategic evaluation: I need to efficiently build toward scoring cards while blocking opponent's black-token strategy. The opponent has L2_69 (needs BLACK:5) and reserved L2_50 (needs BLACK:4), and currently holds BLACK:2 tokens. Taking the last BLACK token from the board (BLACK:1 available) significantly hinders their progress toward these cards.

Taking BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 achieves multiple objectives: 1) It blocks opponent from the scarce black token, 2) It advances me toward L2_47 (1 pt, cost BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2 after my RED bonus), 3) It progresses toward noble N10 (needs BLACK:3, WHITE:3, RED:3), and 4) It maintains token flexibility for future purchases. This is superior to reserving now (which delays scoring) or taking BLUE:2 (which is less flexible). I remain at 7 tokens total, well under the 10-token limit with no returns needed.

Reserved L1_14 costs exactly GREEN 2 + BLACK 2, which matches our tokens, so purchasing it converts tokens into a permanent BLUE bonus, frees a reserve slot for future gold via reserving, and keeps us well under the 10-token limit. This also advances our longer-term plan toward buying reserved L2_50 (needs WHITE 2 + BLACK 4 after our RED discount) by adding a BLUE bonus and reducing token clutter.

2026-01-01 12:55:54.035 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state: I have 0 prestige points (opponent has 2), bonuses WHITE:1/RED:1, and 7 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2). I need to efficiently build toward my first points while maintaining token flexibility.

Strategic analysis: L2_47 (1pt, BLUE bonus, cost BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:3) is my optimal target. With my RED:1 bonus, the effective cost is BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2. I currently have BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, so I need exactly one more of each to purchase it next turn. This card helps toward noble N9 (GREEN:3, RED:3, BLUE:3).

Taking BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 now achieves multiple objectives:
1. Directly sets up L2_47 purchase next turn for my first points
2. Works toward noble N9 (BLUE bonus helps all three colors)
3. Reaches max token count (10) efficiently without waste
4. Maintains flexibility for other purchases (BLACK:2 tokens remain available)
5. Opponent cannot afford L2_47 this turn (they lack required tokens), making it safe to leave exposed

Alternative considerations: Taking 2-of-same-color would be less flexible. Reserving would delay scoring when I have a clear purchase path. The opponent's black-token strategy (reserved L2_50, L3_72) is less urgent than securing my first points.

Action plan: Take BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. I will have exactly BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2 needed for L2_47 next turn.

2026-01-01 12:57:03.881 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We cannot yet afford our key reserved scorer L2_50 (after our RED bonus it needs W2+B4; we have W2+GOLD1 but essentially 0 BLACK). WHITE is currently 0 in the bank, so spending our W2 (e.g., buying L1_39) would likely delay L2_50 significantly.

Best tempo is to reserve a strong points card to (1) gain an additional GOLD token (powerful wildcard to cover scarce BLACK for L2_50) and (2) deny the opponent a 2‑prestige option. L2_56 is a solid 2‑prestige, WHITE-bonus card that also aligns with noble paths requiring WHITE, and it’s a reasonable future buy for us.

So we reserve L2_56 and take 1 GOLD (available). Token total stays well under 10, so no returns.

2026-01-01 12:58:13.066 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state: I'm at max tokens (10) with an even distribution (2 of each color). Opponent has 2 prestige points. I must convert tokens into points now to avoid falling further behind.

Strategic evaluation: I can immediately purchase L2_47 (1 point, BLUE bonus) using my exact token combination: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2. With my RED:1 bonus, the effective cost is BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, which matches my current tokens perfectly. This is optimal because:

1. **Score immediately**: I get my first prestige point, keeping pace with opponent
2. **Efficient conversion**: Turns 6 tokens into a permanent bonus without wasting any
3. **Acquires BLUE bonus**: BLUE appears in many high-value cards (L2_52, L3_79, L3_71, L3_87) and helps toward noble N9
4. **Preserves scarce tokens**: I keep WHITE:2 and BLACK:2, colors that are scarce (WHITE:0, BLACK:2 on board)
5. **Blocks opponent**: Opponent lacks sufficient BLUE, GREEN, RED tokens to afford L2_47, securing this card
6. **Flexible future**: After purchase, I'll have 4 tokens (WHITE:2, BLACK:2), well under the limit, allowing me to take 3 new tokens next turn to set up for L2_68 (2pts) or L3_79 (3pts)

Alternative consideration: L2_41 also costs 1 point but spends my scarce WHITE tokens and gives BLACK bonus. While BLACK bonus blocks opponent's noble aspirations, BLUE bonus is more strategically valuable for reaching high-point cards and noble N9.

Action plan: Purchase L2_47 now to secure first points and establish BLUE bonus advantage.

Since BLACK is scarce in the bank (only 2), we should take a BLACK immediately to keep the L2_50 plan alive; otherwise the opponent can deny it by draining BLACK.

For the other two tokens, we take RED and BLUE to increase flexibility toward alternative scoring lines (e.g., building toward red-heavy purchases like L2_70 / our reserved L3_72) while also modestly denying the opponent, without spending our irreplaceable WHITE tokens (bank WHITE is 0). Token count goes from 4 to 7, so no returns needed.

2026-01-01 13:00:27.091 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Strategic analysis: I now have 1 prestige point from my L2_47 purchase. I need to accelerate my point-gaining to catch up to opponent's 2 points and eventually reach 15.

**Opponent Threat Assessment:** They have 2 prestige points from L2_69, 2 WHITE/BLUE bonuses, and 2 gold tokens. They're also holding L3_72 (4pts, costs RED:7), L2_50 (2pts, costs WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:4), and L2_56 (2pts, costs RED:5, BLACK:3). Their strategy appears to be amassing RED/BLACK cards.

**My Current Resources:** 
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:2
- Bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1  
- Total: 1 prestige point

**L2_68 Analysis (2pts, RED bonus):**
- Cost: WHITE:3, BLACK:5
- With my bonuses: Need effective WHITE:2, BLACK:4  
- I have exactly WHITE:2, BLACK:2 tokens + 2 gold tokens!

This is the highest-point card I can afford NOW. L2_41 (1pt, BLACK bonus) would give less value. Taking more tokens would waste turn time while opponent is already ahead.

**Noble Considerations:**
- My bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1) are split across nobles N9, N10, N7. Adding RED bonus from L2_68 gives me RED:2 total, keeping me competitive for nobles.

**Why this is optimal:**
1. **Immediate 2-point leap**: From 1 to 3 points (surpasses opponent)
2. **Red bonus acquisition**: Helps all three nobles (N9 needs RED:3, N10 needs RED:3, N7 needs RED:3)
3. **Uses gold efficiently**: Gold tokens are flexible but often wasted; here they fill exact gaps
4. **Board state**: WHITE tokens are scarce (0 available), so my WHITE:2 tokens are valuable to use now
5. **Blocks opponent**: Opponent purchased L1_14 (BLUE bonus), not affecting L2_68 accessibility
6. **Token management**: After purchase, I'll have 0 tokens, allowing me to take 3 new tokens next turn without returns

**Final calculation:**
- Pay WHITE:2 (tokens) + WHITE:1 (bonus) = WHITE:3 ✓
- Pay BLACK:2 (tokens) + BLACK:2 (gold substitute) = BLACK:4, still need BLACK:1 more

Wait, I need to recalculate. Cost: WHITE:3, BLACK:5. 
- With bonuses: Need to pay WHITE:2, BLACK:4 in tokens/gold.
- I have: WHITE:2, BLACK:2 tokens + 2 gold tokens.
- Gold can substitute ANY color.

So I pay:
- WHITE:2 (all my white tokens)
- BLACK:2 (all my black tokens)  
- GOLD:2, treating them as BLACK (or any color toward the remaining BLACK:2)

This exactly covers the total cost. After purchase, I'll have 0 tokens left, gain +2 prestige points (total: 3), and acquire a RED bonus. This is the highest-value play available to me now.

> Strategic evaluation reveals the board has BLACK:1 available token, creating scarcity. Opponent currently has BLACK:1 token and needs BLACK for their reserved cards L2_50 (cost BLACK:4) and L3_72 (implicitly needs BLACK). Taking the last BLACK token blocks their progress while advancing my strategy.

> Taking BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 achieves three critical objectives:
1) **Denies opponent scarce BLACK resource** - removes their access to last board BLACK token
2) **Advances toward L2_68** - builds my token count toward needed BLACK:5
3) **Maintains efficiency** - no returns needed, reaching 7 tokens total, preserving flexibility for future turns

> WHITE tokens are unavailable on board (0), and alternative 2-token same-color take is suboptimal compared to this 3-color strategic draw that both blocks opponent and builds toward my 2-point card.

> This move positions me to collect remaining BLACK tokens over next 2 turns while staying competitive with opponent's score, potentially reaching 3 total points when I complete L2_68 purchase.

We already have B1, and we can cover the missing 1 WHITE with a GOLD next turn (since WHITE tokens aren’t available). Therefore, taking exactly 2 GREEN now (legal because 4 are available) puts us at G2 and makes L2_41 purchasable next turn, which in turn will reduce the BLACK requirement on our reserved L2_50 and likely allow us to buy it soon after.

Token count goes from 7 to 9, so no returns needed.

2026-01-01 13:04:25.548 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 1 prestige point (opponent has 2), tokens WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, and bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1. The opponent can immediately purchase L2_41 (cost: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2) using their WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2 tokens, which would give them 3 total points and a BLACK bonus, significantly extending their lead. Since I cannot purchase any card this turn and cannot take 2 green tokens (board only has 2 green, requiring 4+ for 2-of-same-color), I must block this threatened loss. Reserving L2_41 now prevents the opponent from acquiring it, secures a 1-point card I can afford next turn after collecting green tokens, and grants me a gold token (board has GOLD:3 available) for future flexibility. While this delays my token collection by one turn, blocking a guaranteed opponent score while securing my own path to 2 points is strategically superior to taking tokens and allowing opponent to seize L2_41.

2026-01-01 13:05:31.813 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We’re at 9 tokens, so taking 3 different would force us to return 2 (very low tempo). Reserving is also impossible because we already have 3 reserved cards.

Best move is to purchase an efficient card that (a) costs us very little, (b) reduces token clutter, and (c) improves our engine without spending the scarce resources we need for reserved L2_50 (WHITE/BLACK + our GOLD).

Face-up L1_30 (GREEN bonus) costs BLUE 2 + RED 2; with our bonuses (BLUE+1, RED+1) it effectively costs BLUE 1 + RED 1, which we can pay exactly with our tokens. This keeps our WHITE and GOLD intact for the L2_50 plan, drops us to 7 tokens (more flexibility next turn), and adds a GREEN permanent bonus toward nobles/level-2+ buys.

So we purchase L1_30.

2026-01-01 13:10:39.855 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 1 prestige point vs opponent's 2 points, with 7 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1. I have L2_41 reserved (1 pt, needs 2 GREEN tokens). The opponent has a 4-point card L3_72 reserved, which is a major threat.

Strategic evaluation: I need to efficiently reach 3+ points while building my engine. L2_68 (2 pts, RED bonus) is an optimal target - I already have BLACK:3 tokens toward its BLACK:5 cost, and the RED bonus would stack with my existing RED:1 bonus. BLACK tokens are currently unavailable on board (0 available), making this card harder to acquire later.

Reserving L2_68 now achieves multiple objectives:
1. **Secures 2-point card** - Prevents opponent from acquiring this valuable card
2. **Gains GOLD token** - Board has GOLD:2 available, giving me flexibility for future purchases
3. **Maintains token efficiency** - I go from 7 to 8 tokens, staying well under the 10-token limit
4. **Clear upgrade path** - I need only 2 more BLACK tokens (which may replenish when opponent buys BLACK-cost cards)
5. **Bonus synergy** - RED bonus stacks with existing RED:1, helping future RED-cost cards like L2_70 (3 pts)
6. **Noble progression** - RED bonus helps toward noble N9 (needs RED:3)

Alternative considerations: Taking BLUE:1, RED:1, GREEN:1 would reach 10 tokens but leaves me with no clear path to immediate points. Purchasing 0-point cards like L1_27 would waste my GOLD token without advancing my score. Reserving L2_68 is superior as it locks in 2 future points while maintaining flexibility.

Action: Reserve L2_68 to secure the 2-point card and acquire a GOLD token.

Best tempo is to take 3 different tokens (the only legal/available colors are BLUE/GREEN/RED) to (1) reach 3 GREEN tokens, enabling us to buy face-up L1_24 next turn using only GREEN (cost G4 reduced by our +1 GREEN bonus → pay G3), gaining +1 prestige and a WHITE bonus without spending GOLD; and (2) keep our 2 GOLD intact to later cover missing BLACK for L2_50 when BLACK tokens reappear.

Taking BLUE+GREEN+RED brings us from 7 tokens to exactly 10, so no returns are needed.

2026-01-01 13:15:22.816 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state: I have 1 prestige point vs opponent's 2 points, with 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:2) and bonuses WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1. I have L2_68 reserved (2 pts, RED bonus).

Critical analysis: I can immediately purchase L2_68 this turn! The cost is WHITE:3, BLACK:5. With my WHITE:1 bonus, effective cost is WHITE:2, BLACK:5. I have exactly WHITE:2 and BLACK:3 tokens, plus GOLD:2 which I can use as wildcards for the remaining BLACK:2. This is an optimal move because:

1. **Score efficiency**: Gain 2 points in one turn, jumping to 3 total points and taking the lead
2. **Bonus synergy**: RED bonus stacks with my existing RED:1, giving me RED:2 total (strong for noble N9 and future RED-cost cards like L2_70)
3. **Token optimization**: Uses my 2 GOLD tokens productively instead of letting them sit idle
4. **Blocks opponent**: Prevents opponent from ever acquiring this 2-point card (they have no BLACK access)
5. **Clears token space**: After purchase I'll have only 2 tokens (BLUE:1, RED:1), allowing me to take 3 new tokens next turn without returns

Alternative evaluation: I could purchase L2_41 for 1 point using GOLD as GREEN, but 2 points is strictly better. Taking GREEN token would only get me 1 point next turn, while purchasing L2_68 now gets me 2 points immediately.

This purchase executes the plan I've been building toward for several turns and puts me in the lead with a strong RED bonus engine.

2026-01-01 13:15:54.041 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are already at 10 tokens and cannot reserve (we have 3 reserved), so taking tokens would force inefficient returns. The best tempo play is to purchase a card to shed tokens while gaining prestige. Face-up L1_24 is ideal: it’s worth 1 prestige and provides a WHITE permanent bonus. Its cost is GREEN 4, reduced by our +1 GREEN bonus to GREEN 3, which we can pay exactly with our 3 GREEN tokens, preserving our scarce WHITE and GOLD for later purchases (notably reserved L2_50). This drops our token count from 10 to 7 and increases our score by 1.

2026-01-01 13:15:54.041 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, RED=3}
2026-01-01 13:16:32.757 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current analysis: I'm tied at 3-3 with opponent but only have 2 tokens (BLUE:1, RED:1). Opponent can immediately purchase L1_20 using their WHITE:2 and BLACK:1 tokens, gaining a WHITE bonus and strengthening their noble position. I need to build my token economy while blocking opponent resources.

Strategic evaluation:

1. **Token deficiency**: With only 2 tokens, I cannot purchase any cards this turn. I must increase my token count to enable future purchases.

2. **Target identification**: L2_55 (2 points, WHITE bonus) is my most achievable high-value card. With my RED:2 bonus, effective cost is RED:2, BLACK:1. I currently have RED:1, so I need RED:1, BLACK:1 more.

3. **Blocking opponent**: Opponent needs BLACK tokens for their reserved cards L2_50 (needs BLACK:3) and L2_56 (needs BLACK:2). Taking BLACK:1 reduces their access. Additionally, WHITE tokens are scarce (only 2 available), and taking WHITE:1 prevents opponent from stockpiling them.

4. **Optimal token selection**: Taking WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 achieves multiple objectives:
   - Builds toward L2_55 (my 2-point target)
   - Blocks opponent's BLACK and WHITE access
   - Increases my token count from 2 to 5 (well under 10-token limit)
   - Maintains flexibility for alternative purchases like L1_20 (need WHITE:2, BLACK:1) or L2_41 (need WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLUE:1)

5. **No returns needed**: Current tokens (2) + taking 3 = 5 total, no discarding required.

This move efficiently builds my purchasing power while strategically denying opponent resources, positioning me to score 2 points with L2_55 in the next 1-2 turns.

2026-01-01 13:17:28.861 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Best tempo is to convert our 2 GOLD into immediate prestige and a key engine bonus. Face-up L2_45 (2 prestige, BLACK bonus) is purchasable right now: its cost is WHITE 5, reduced by our +1 WHITE bonus to WHITE 4, which we can pay using WHITE2 + GOLD2. This scores 2 points immediately, adds a permanent BLACK bonus that directly helps our reserved black-heavy cards (especially L2_50 / L2_56), and reduces our token clutter from 7 to 3 without needing any inefficient token returns. It’s also the only affordable face-up prestige card this turn, so we should take it now before the opponent can reserve it to deny us.

2026-01-01 13:19:26.683 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current state: I have 3 points vs opponent's 5 points, with 5 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:2, BLACK:1). Opponent can buy L1_27 this turn, but it's only a 0-point card. My critical issue is catching up in points efficiently.

Analysis: Cannot purchase any point-scoring card this turn. L2_55 (2 points, WHITE bonus) is my most efficient target - with my RED:2 bonus, it costs only GREEN:1, BLACK:2. I currently have BLACK:1, so need just GREEN:1 and BLACK:1 more. Taking these tokens lets me buy L2_55 next turn and reach 5 points.

Strategic token selection: Taking GREEN:1, BLACK:1, RED:1 achieves multiple objectives:
1. **Directly enables L2_55** - Gets me the exact two tokens needed (GREEN:1, BLACK:1) for a 2-point purchase next turn
2. **Blocks opponent's RED access** - Board has only RED:1 available, and opponent needs RED:3+ for their reserved L2_56 and L3_72 (4-point card). Taking the last RED severely slows their high-point plans
3. **Maintains token efficiency** - No returns needed (5→8 tokens), preserving flexibility
4. **Prepares future engine** - RED:3 total tokens positions me to later acquire L2_70 (3 points, RED bonus) for a total of 8 points

Alternative considered: Reserving L2_70 would block opponent but delay my point acquisition. Taking other color combinations doesn't directly enable a 2-point purchase next turn. This move optimally balances immediate point progression with opponent denial.

Result: After this take, I'll have GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:2, WHITE:1, BLUE:1. Next turn I can purchase L2_55 using GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2, gaining 2 points and WHITE bonus, tying the score at 5-5 while having a stronger token position.

2026-01-01 13:20:27.986 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We should avoid purchasing L1_27 right now even though it’s affordable, because it would spend our only RED token and (more importantly) return a RED token to the bank (currently RED=0), enabling the opponent—who has strong RED economy (RED bonus=2 and 3 RED tokens)—to start taking RED toward their likely L2_70 (3 points, cost effectively R4).

Instead, we need to progress toward our reserved L2_50 (2 points) which effectively costs W1 + Bk3 after bonuses. BLACK is extremely scarce on the board (only 1 available), so taking it now both advances our plan and denies the opponent. Taking WHITE helps toward L2_50 and also toward face-up L2_61 later. Taking BLUE is the best third token available (RED is unavailable), and keeps flexibility for future buys.

Token count goes from 3 to 6, so no returns are needed.

This will tie the score at 5-5 and grant me a WHITE bonus, which progresses me toward noble N10 (RED:3, WHITE:3, BLACK:3). The opponent is desperate for RED tokens (board has RED:0) for their reserved cards L2_56 and L3_72, but taking a 2-point card now is more valuable than blocking, as it changes the score dynamic. After purchase, I'll have 3 tokens remaining (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1), well under the 10-token limit, positioning me for further actions next turn. This is more efficient than my previous token-taking plan since I can score points immediately.

2026-01-01 13:21:27.783 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We should set up an immediate purchase of our reserved L2_50 (2 prestige) next turn. With our current bonuses (all +1), L2_50’s cost (W2 R1 Bk4) is effectively W1 + Bk3 (RED becomes 0). Right now we already have W1 and Bk2, so we only need +1 BLACK to be able to buy it.

We cannot take 2 BLACK (only 2 BLACK in the bank; requires 4+), so the best legal collection is to take 3 different including BLACK. Adding WHITE also advances future buys like L2_61 (effective W3 B1), and GREEN is a useful flexible third color. This keeps us under the 10-token limit (6 → 9) with no returns and lines up a strong scoring purchase next turn.

- Opponent at 5 points with 9 tokens and strong purchasing power
- Only 0-point card L1_39 is affordable this turn (cost WHITE:3, effective WHITE:1 with my bonus)
- Buying L1_39 achieves multiple critical objectives:
  1. **Strengthens bonus engine**: RED bonus increases to 3, positioning me for nobles N9 (needs RED:3) and N10 (needs RED:3)
  2. **Blocks opponent**: Prevents opponent from acquiring this RED bonus card
  3. **Low cost**: Only spends 1 WHITE token, leaving me with 2 tokens (BLUE:1, RED:1) for flexible actions next turn
  4. **Tempo maintenance**: While scoring 0 points now, it accelerates my path to nobles which provide 3 points each
  5. **No token waste**: No returns needed, keeps me under 10-token limit
- Alternative considered: Taking tokens would delay bonus acquisition and leave L1_39 vulnerable to opponent
- Alternative considered: Reserving L2_70 (3 points) would block opponent but delay my engine development and noble progression
- Opponent's L2_61 threat: They need WHITE:1 more to buy it; taking WHITE token would block them but forfeit the immediate RED:3 bonus
- **Strategic priority**: Establish RED:3 bonus now, then leverage it next turn to take tokens toward either L2_70 (3 points) or noble acquisition
- This move optimally balances immediate engine improvement with long-term point potential while maintaining resource efficiency

2026-01-01 13:25:00.708 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 5 points vs opponent's 7 points with only 2 tokens (BLUE:1, RED:1), making purchases impossible. My RED:3 bonus positions me strongly for nobles N9 and N10. 

Critical analysis reveals L2_70 is my optimal target: it's a 3-point card with RED bonus that I can purchase next turn. With my RED:3 bonus, its effective cost is only RED:3 tokens. I currently have RED:1 token, so taking RED:2 next turn enables immediate purchase.

The key risk is that opponent (with 5 tokens) could reserve L2_70 themselves this turn, delaying my acquisition. By reserving it now, I guarantee this 3-point card for my next turn, block opponent from it, and gain a valuable GOLD token for flexibility.

Opponent can only purchase 0-point cards this turn (like L1_6), so they won't increase their score immediately. Securing L2_70 gives me a clear path to 8 points with RED:4 bonus, accelerating my noble progression while maintaining tempo in the point race.

This move optimally balances point acquisition, bonus synergy, opponent blocking, and resource efficiency.

With our current 2 BLUE tokens, reserving L2_52 puts us very close to purchasing it next (we’ll only need one more BLUE token or another GOLD), setting up a fast jump from 7 to 10 prestige.

**Current Situation Analysis:**

**My Status (Player 1):**
- Score: 5 points (trailing 5-7)
- Tokens: BLUE:1, RED:1, GOLD:1 (3 total)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, RED:3 - Excellent RED bonus positioning
- Reserved: L2_70 (3pts, RED bonus, effective cost RED:3)

**Opponent Status (Player 0):**
- Score: 7 points (leading)
- Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, GOLD:1 (6 total)
- Reserved threats: L2_56 (2pts), L2_52 (3pts), L3_72 (4pts)
- Needs RED tokens desperately for reserved cards

**Critical Path Forward:**

My reserved L2_70 is the key to victory:
- Cost: RED:6
- My bonus: RED:3
- Effective cost: RED:3 tokens
- I have: RED:1 token + GOLD:1 (can substitute)
- **Need: RED:1 more token to purchase L2_70 next turn**

After buying L2_70: Score becomes 8 (taking the lead), bonus becomes RED:4, positioning for nobles.

**Token Selection Strategy:**

Board has RED:2 available. Since I can only take RED:1 (need 4+ for double-take), I must take it now before opponent does.

**Optimal Take: WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1**

This triple-blocks opponent:
1. **RED:1** - Directly enables my L2_70 purchase next turn
2. **WHITE:1** - Blocks opponent's L2_61 purchase (they need WHITE:3 more)
3. **BLACK:1** - Blocks their L2_56 reserved card (needs BLACK:3)

**Token Management:**
- Current: 3 tokens
- Taking: 3 tokens
- New total: 6 tokens (under 10 limit)
- No returns needed

**Next Turn Plan:**
With RED:2 tokens + GOLD:1, I can immediately purchase L2_70 (3pts) and take the lead 8-7. The GOLD substitutes for the third RED token needed.

This move efficiently combines point progression, opponent denial, and noble positioning while maintaining perfect token economy.

2026-01-01 13:29:38.643 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are capped at 3 reserved cards already, so we cannot reserve L2_57 to deny the opponent or to gain an extra GOLD. Our best tempo is to convert our reserved L2_52 (3 prestige) as soon as possible: its cost is BLUE 6, reduced by our +2 BLUE bonus to BLUE 4. Currently we only have BLUE2 + GOLD1 = 3 toward that, so we must take the lone BLUE token on the board now; otherwise the opponent can take it and significantly delay our 3-point purchase.

We take BLUE + WHITE + BLACK as the best 3-different set: BLUE completes next-turn affordability of L2_52 (we’ll have BLUE3+GOLD1 to pay the effective BLUE4), while WHITE helps toward L2_61 (effective cost W3) and BLACK helps toward our future reserved L2_56 (needs BLACK) and general flexibility. Token count goes 6→9, staying under 10 with no returns.

2026-01-01 13:31:11.601 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am trailing 5-7 and need efficient point generation. My reserved L2_70 costs RED:6, and with my RED:3 bonus, the effective cost is RED:3. I currently have RED:2 tokens and GOLD:1, which means I can purchase L2_70 immediately by using the gold token as a substitute for the third RED token. This scores 3 points, taking me to 8 points and giving me the lead over opponent's 7. The purchase also increases my RED bonus to 4, positioning me strongly for nobles N9 (needs RED:3) and N7 (needs RED:3). While this spends my gold token, the immediate point gain is critical. After purchase, I'll have 3 tokens remaining (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1), well under the limit, maintaining flexibility for next turn. This is more valuable than taking tokens or reserving another card, as it directly converts my existing resources into points and the lead.

2026-01-01 13:38:56.947 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We can’t buy any prestige card this turn, so the best play is a high-impact reserve for tempo denial + flexibility. Opponent has very strong RED discounts (RED=4) and can realistically aim to buy the face-up 4-point Level 3 card L3_73 soon (its effective cost for them is relatively reachable), which would massively accelerate them toward 15. Reserving L3_73 removes that win-condition from the board while also giving us a GOLD token (available), which increases our flexibility to buy near-term points like L2_61 (effective W3) and to smooth future purchases. We stay well under the 10-token cap and don’t need to return anything.

2026-01-01 13:46:29.184 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Critical analysis: Opponent is at 10 points, I'm at 8. I need immediate points to avoid falling too far behind. I can purchase L2_57 (2 points, RED:5 cost) using my RED:4 bonus - I only need to spend RED:1 token which I have. This brings my score to 10, tying the game, and increases my RED bonus to 5 which strongly positions me for nobles (N9, N7, N10 all require RED:3). While this doesn't block opponent's token access, immediate point gain is crucial when trailing. Alternative of taking tokens to block opponent's RED access would leave me at 8 points and potentially allow opponent to extend their lead. Purchasing now maintains tempo in the point race.

It is affordable right now: cost W4 B2 Bk1 is reduced by our bonuses (W1, B3, Bk1) to an effective cost of WHITE 3 only (BLUE and BLACK become 0). We can pay with our current tokens WHITE2 + GOLD1. This both advances us to 12 prestige and denies the opponent a card they can also buy immediately (they can pay W1 B1 Bk1 with their bonuses/tokens), preventing them from jumping to 12 and gaining the GREEN bonus toward nobles.

2026-01-01 13:49:33.920 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: :1 turn and they desperately need RED tokens for their reserved cards (L3_72 needs 6 red, L2_56 needs 4 red, L3_73 needs 5 red). I must block their red access while continuing my noble progression. I'm at 10 points and perfectly positioned for noble N10 which requires RED:3, WHITE:3, BLACK:3. Current bonuses: WHITE:3, RED:4, BLACK:2 - only need BLACK:1 more. 

The optimal path is: take RED:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 this turn. This blocks opponent's red access (reducing board from 3 to 2, preventing them from taking 2 red next turn), gives me GREEN:2 which allows purchase of L2_42 next turn (cost: GREEN:2 effective), and gets me to BLACK:3 total. 

Next turn I can purchase L2_42 (spend GREEN:2, gain 1 point + BLACK:3 bonus), claim N10 for +3 points (total 14), then win with any 1-point card. This blocks opponent's win condition while accelerating mine.

Token management: Current 5 tokens → taking 3 → new total 8 tokens (under limit). No returns needed.

2026-01-01 13:52:48.690 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We’re at 12 prestige and the fastest visible win line is buying face-up L3_71 (3 prestige) to reach 15. With our current bonuses (W1 B3 G2 R1 Bk1), L3_71 effectively costs W2 + G3 + R2 (BLUE is fully discounted). The major bottleneck is GREEN tokens: the bank has only 1 GREEN available, so we must secure it now to keep the L3_71 plan alive.

Taking WHITE+GREEN+RED advances the exact colors needed for L3_71 while also denying the opponent a scarce GREEN and a RED (they have strong RED bonuses). After this, we can aim to buy L1_27 (costs only R1+Bk1 for us) to raise our GREEN bonus to 3, reducing the needed GREEN tokens for L3_71 to 2 total (which we’ll then already have), and finish by collecting the remaining WHITE/RED.

Token count goes from 3 to 6, so no returns are needed.

2026-01-01 13:58:12.566 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We’re at 12 prestige and the cleanest win is still purchasing face-up L3_71 (3 prestige) to reach 15. With our current bonuses (W1 B3 G2 R1 Bk1), L3_71’s effective cost is W2 + G3 + R2. Our current tokens (W1 G2 R2 Bk1) are short exactly 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN.

So we take WHITE and GREEN now to complete next-turn affordability. For the required 3rd distinct token, taking the last RED (bank has only 1) is best: it denies a scarce color to the opponent while also advancing our longer-term backup plan toward our reserved high-point RED-heavy cards if L3_71 gets reserved/blocked.

Token total goes 6 → 9, so no returns are needed.

2026-01-01 13:59:08.539 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am trailing 11-12 and need 4 points to win. Analysis shows no immediate 1-turn win is possible, but I can execute a guaranteed 2-turn win by reserving the 4-point card L3_77 now and purchasing it on my next turn. 

Key factors:
1) I cannot purchase any card for 4+ points this turn due to token constraints
2) Opponent cannot win this turn (board has RED:0, BLACK:0, and they lack sufficient tokens for their reserved cards)
3) L3_77 costs WHITE:6, BLUE:3, BLACK:3 → effective cost with my bonuses (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1) is WHITE:3, BLUE:2, BLACK:2
4) Current tokens: WHITE:1, BLACK:3 → need WHITE:2, BLUE:2
5) Board has BLUE:4, WHITE:1, GREEN:1 → I can take WHITE:1, BLUE:2 next turn to have enough tokens (using GOLD:1 from this reserve action to substitute for the missing WHITE token)

This plan is robust even if opponent takes BLUE:2 on their turn, as board would still have BLUE:2 remaining for me. Opponent can reach at most 13 points (by purchasing L2_42), so my 2-turn win is secure.

Alternative moves like purchasing L2_65 (1pt) would give me 12 points but no clear path to 15 before opponent can respond. Taking tokens would be slow and inefficient when a direct win is available.

2026-01-01 13:59:37.787 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We can win immediately by purchasing face-up L3_71 (3 prestige), moving from 12 → 15.

Affordability check: L3_71 costs W3 B3 G5 R3. With our bonuses (W1, B3, G2, R1, Bk1) the effective cost becomes W2 + G3 + R2 (BLUE reduced to 0). Our current tokens are W2 G3 R3 Bk1, so we can pay exactly W2 G3 R2 and keep R1 Bk1.

This reaches 15 prestige now, and the opponent (at 11) cannot realistically hit 15 in their final response turn (no affordable 4-point card and no noble pickup available), so this is the fastest and safest finish.

2026-01-01 14:00:00.375 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Strategic Analysis:

1. **Score Check**: I'm at 11 points, opponent is at 15 points - THEY HAVE ALREADY WON! The game should be over. I need to check if this game state is valid.

2. **Game State Verification**: Wait, reviewing the code logic - Player ID 0 (opponent) has score:15, purchased cards include multiple level 2 and 3 cards. They've reached 15+ points.

3. **Is Game Over?**: In Splendor, the game ends immediately when a player reaches 15 points. Since opponent has 15 points, the game should be over. However, I'm being asked to make a move, which suggests either:
   - The game continues for one more round (some house rules)
   - There's an error in the game state
   - I need to make a move anyway

4. **Assuming I must continue**: Let me review my position:
   - 11 points, need 4 points to tie/win
   - Reserved L3_77 (4 points, cost: WHITE:6, BLUE:3, BLACK:3)
   - Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, RED:4, BLACK:1, GREEN:0
   - Tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1
   - Effective cost for L3_77: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, BLACK:2
   - I'm short: WHITE:2, BLUE:2

5. **Board Analysis**: 
   - Board tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:4, GREEN:4, RED:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:4
   - I cannot take 2 BLUE in one turn (would need to take 1 of each, or 2 different colors)
   - Next turn I could take WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1 or similar

6. **Alternative: Block Opponent**: If game continues, I should try to prevent opponent from increasing their lead. They have reserved cards needing lots of RED (L3_72 needs 7 red, L2_56 needs 5 red, L3_73 needs 6 red). 

7. **Reserve Blocking**: I can reserve L3_72 (opponent's reserved 4-point card) to deny them access. This is a strategic block:
   - Prevents opponent from getting 4 more points
   - Gives me 1 gold token (GOLD:1)
   - Board has GOLD:4, so I can take one
   - This would put my tokens at 6 total, still under 10

8. **Token Management**: Currently have 6 tokens, taking 1 gold = 7 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:2). Under 10, no returns needed.

9. **Why Not Other Actions?**
   - Take tokens: Wouldn't block opponent
   - Purchase: Can't afford any high-point cards, buying low-point cards won't catch up
   - Reserve my own card: Already have L3_77 reserved
   - Reserve board card for points: L3_88 (4 points, GREEN:7 cost) - can't afford

10. **Conclusion**: Since opponent has won, but I'm asked to move, I'll make a blocking move to reserve one of their key cards while gaining a gold token for future flexibility. This is the most strategic option available.

Final Decision: Reserve L3_72 to block opponent and gain gold token.

I have 11 points and cannot reach 15 in one turn. The most productive move is to purchase L2_65 for 1 point, bringing my score to 12. With my bonuses (WHITE:3, RED:4, BLACK:1), the effective cost of L2_65 is only BLACK:2, which I can afford with my BLACK:3 tokens. This is a valid, point-scoring move that maximizes my final score.
