The available Nobles (N7, N2, N9) heavily favor Green and Red, with secondary needs in Blue and Black. White is not required by any noble visible. Looking at Level 1 cards, L1_37 (Red bonus) costs 2 Blue, 1 Green. This is an efficient engine starter that provides Red (a noble color) and is relatively cheap. To acquire this card quickly, I need Blue and Green tokens. Since I must take 3 different colors, I will take Green, Blue, and Red. Green/Red for noble alignment, and Blue to afford L1_37 next turn.

2026-01-01 12:34:09.167 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens and no bonuses. I cannot purchase any card this turn because I lack the required resources. Reserving a card would only give me a gold token without immediately advancing toward prestige points. Therefore the optimal move is to take tokens to build a resource base. Looking at the visible cards, L1_37 (cost 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN) is one of the cheapest affordable cards later, and many Level 2 and 3 cards also require RED. I have sufficient supply of BLUE (3), GREEN (3), and RED (3) on the board, so I can take one of each of these three different colors. This gives me a solid foundation (BLUE and GREEN) for future purchases and also adds RED for later higher‑value cards. The total tokens after taking will be 3, well below the 10‑token limit, so no tokens need to be returned.

My target card is L1_37 (Red bonus, cost 2 Blue/1 Green) to align with Nobles N2 and N9. To afford L1_37 next turn, I need one more Blue token. Furthermore, Green and Red are scarce (only 1 left in the bank) and are critical for the available Nobles. Taking Blue, Green, and Red accomplishes three things: 1) Secures the specific tokens needed to purchase L1_37 next turn. 2) Drains the bank of Green and Red, denying the opponent access to key Noble colors. 3) Drains the bank of Blue, preventing the opponent from snatching L1_37. This move establishes a strong engine and puts significant pressure on the opponent's token options.

Player 0 has exactly 2 BLUE and 2 GREEN, so they can purchase this card this turn and gain a RED bonus gem that would accelerate their engine. To prevent this immediate threat and block the opponent from gaining a valuable discount, the optimal move is to reserve L1_37. Reserving removes the card from the board, denies the opponent the purchase, and grants 1 gold token that can be used later to help acquire future cards. Since I currently lack the resources to purchase any card, reserving the high‑value target is the best strategic choice to both hinder the opponent and move toward the goal of 15 prestige points.

I currently hold 2 Blue, 2 Green, and 2 Red tokens. The board bank has exactly 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red left. Taking these three specific tokens is the optimal strategic play for several reasons: 1) It brings my holdings to 3 of each color (Blue, Green, Red), which perfectly matches the requirements for Noble N9 and puts me in a strong position to claim it once I acquire the respective development cards. 2) It completely drains the bank of these three colors. 3) Critically, it denies the opponent the last Blue token they need to purchase their reserved card L1_37 (Cost: 2 Blue, 1 Green). By taking the Blue, I force them to use their Gold token or delay their purchase, stifling their early engine progress. This move secures my path to a noble while aggressively disrupting the opponent.

Allowing that purchase would give the opponent a WHITE bonus gem that could accelerate their engine, but the immediate benefit of blocking it is less valuable than developing my own engine. I can take three different colors from the board because WHITE, BLACK, and GOLD each have 4 tokens available. Taking 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, 1 GOLD adds a second GOLD token and gives me tokens of three useful colours without exceeding the 10‑token limit, so no returns are needed. This move expands my resource base, improves flexibility for future purchases of high‑prestige cards, and still leaves me well‑positioned to deny the opponent later opportunities.

We cannot purchase any visible card this turn because all affordable cards require combinations of gems we lack (e.g., L1_23 needs 3 BLUE, L1_14 needs 2 GREEN + 2 BLACK, L1_39 needs 3 WHITE). The only card that the opponent (player 0) can purchase immediately is L1_23, which costs 3 BLUE and would give them a WHITE bonus gem, advancing their engine. To prevent this threat and also gain a wild GOLD token for future purchases, the optimal move is to RESERVE_CARD L1_23. Reserving removes the card from the board, blocks the opponent from gaining the WHITE bonus, and grants us 1 additional GOLD token. Our token total would become 5 (still below the 10‑token limit), so no tokens need to be returned. This action simultaneously denies the opponent an immediate score‑boosting purchase and provides us with a flexible resource for later turns, moving us closer to the 15‑prestige‑point goal.

2026-01-01 12:37:36.687 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently hold 3 Blue, 3 Green, and 3 Red tokens (9 total). The board bank has only White and Black tokens available (Blue, Green, and Red are depleted). I must make a move. Taking tokens is difficult because I can only take 2 of the same color (White or Black), which would force me to return a token due to the 10-token limit, wasting a turn. Therefore, purchasing a card is the superior option. I have three affordable Level 1 cards: L1_14 (Blue bonus, cost 2G/2B), L1_27 (Green bonus, cost 3B/2R), and L1_4 (Black bonus, cost 1G/3R/1B). Purchasing L1_14 is the best strategic choice because it grants a Blue bonus. The available Nobles (N7, N9) require 3 Blue. I currently have 0 Blue bonuses but 3 Blue tokens. Buying L1_14 converts 2 Blue tokens into 1 permanent Blue bonus. This leaves me with 1 Blue bonus + 1 remaining Blue token, putting me at 2/3 towards the Blue requirement for N9. It also preserves my 3 Red tokens, which are valuable for N2 and N7. This move efficiently reduces my token count (avoiding the return mechanic) and accelerates my path to a Noble.

The bank is empty of Blue, Green, and Red. To progress, I need to acquire the missing colors. My best engine-building opportunity is L1_4, which provides a Black bonus (critical for Noble N7) and costs Green/Red tokens I already possess. To afford L1_4 (Cost: 1 Green, 3 Red, 1 Black) and set up future plays, I will take 2 Black tokens and 1 White token. This brings my total to 12 tokens, so I must return 2. I will return 2 Blue tokens, as I have an excess. This leaves me with 1 Blue, 3 Green, 3 Red, 1 White, 2 Black—enough to purchase L1_4 next turn and significantly closer to satisfying Noble requirements.

2026-01-01 12:39:36.828 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently hold 3 Blue, 3 Green, and 3 Red tokens (total 6). The board bank shows 0 tokens for Blue, Green, and Red, meaning I cannot take any of those. The available colors are White (4) and Black (4). Since there are fewer than 3 colors available with >0 tokens, I cannot take 3 different tokens. The rules allow taking 2 tokens of the same color if there are 4+ available. Both White and Black meet this condition. 

Strategically, Black tokens are more valuable to me right now. 1) They are required for Noble N7 (Green/Black/Red), and I already have strong token reserves in Green and Red. 2) Black tokens open up purchasing options for Level 1 cards like L1_14 (Blue bonus, cost 2 Green/2 Black) and L1_27 (Green bonus, cost 1 Blue/2 Red/2 Black). 3) Taking Black does not significantly help the opponent, as they seem focused on Blue/Green/Red for their reserved card L1_37.

I will take 2 Black tokens. This brings my total to 8 tokens, well below the limit of 10.

I currently hold 5 tokens (1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 2 GOLD) and cannot afford any visible card this turn. My long‑term goal is to accumulate the gem combinations needed for the 3 nobles (N7, N2, N9) and eventually reach 15 prestige points. Since many high‑value cards (e.g., L1_39, L2_65, L2_67, L3_77, L3_82) require WHITE, acquiring WHITE tokens now increases my flexibility to purchase those cards later, whereas BLACK is needed for fewer cards. Taking exactly 2 WHITE tokens satisfies the "TAKE_TOKENS" rule (2 of the same color, supply ≥4) and adds 2 tokens to my hand, bringing my total to 7, well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. This move expands my resource pool without risking overload and positions me to afford future purchases that generate prestige points.

Opponent can purchase L1_14, L1_4, or L1_27 this turn, each granting a bonus gem (BLUE, BLACK, GREEN respectively). The BLUE bonus from L1_14 is the most versatile and would significantly accelerate the opponent's engine. However, the longer‑term objective is to reach 15 prestige points as quickly as possible while denying the opponent access to high‑value cards. Among the visible cards, L2_51 (Level 2) is the only card that directly provides 2 prestige points and is currently unaffordable (cost 5 BLUE). By reserving L2_51 we lock it for ourselves, receive one gold token (adding flexibility), and prevent the opponent from ever claiming it, since only the reserving player can later purchase their reserved cards. This move directly advances our race to 15 points and is more strategic than merely taking tokens or blocking a low‑value bonus gem. Therefore the optimal action is to RESERVE_CARD L2_51.

2026-01-01 12:41:49.055 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I hold 10 tokens (2 Blue, 3 Green, 3 Red, 2 Black) and cannot take more without returning. I have identified a profitable purchase in L1_27, which provides a Green bonus (essential for Nobles N7, N2, and N9). The cost is 1 Blue, 2 Red, and 2 Black. My current tokens cover this cost exactly: 2 Blue >= 1, 3 Red >= 2, 2 Black >= 2. Buying this card reduces my token count to 7, avoids waste, and secures a Green bonus towards my noble goals. L1_4 is also affordable but gives a Black bonus which is less aligned with the specific Noble requirements (N2, N9, N7 all prioritize Green/Red/Blue).

This is the highest‑value purchase we can make this turn, directly advancing our goal of 15 prestige points. No token-taking or reserving is needed, and we will not exceed the 10‑token limit after the purchase.

2026-01-01 12:43:12.858 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My opponent holds a reserved card L1_37 (Cost: 2 Blue, 1 Green) and currently has only 1 Blue token. The board bank has 2 Blue tokens. By taking 2 Blue tokens, I completely drain the bank of Blue, forcing my opponent to either use their single Gold token to buy L1_37 (which they don't have) or wait for a refill, significantly stalling their engine development. This move also advances my own strategy; I now hold 3 Blue, 3 Green, and 1 Red. This positions me to purchase L2_67 (Red bonus, 2 prestige) in the near future, which costs 4 Blue, 2 Green, and 1 White. I just need to acquire one more Blue and one White token. This play combines aggressive denial of the opponent's critical color with efficient progress toward a high-value card that secures a Red bonus for the Nobles.

Taking 2 Black tokens is the best move for several reasons: 1) Black is the only color with 4+ tokens available, allowing me to take 2. 2) Acquiring 2 Black tokens (total 2) allows me to purchase L1_14 next turn, which costs 2 Green and 2 Black. 3) Buying L1_14 gives me a Blue bonus, advancing my progress towards Noble N9 (requires 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Green). 4) While the opponent will likely buy L1_37 this turn, securing my own engine development with a guaranteed card purchase next turn is the most efficient use of my turn. This move brings my total tokens to 7, well within the 10-token limit.

The only visible card I can afford right now is L1_39, which would give me 0 prestige points. Moreover, opponent player 0 can purchase L1_14 this turn (cost GREEN2, BLACK2) and would gain a BLUE bonus gem, accelerating their engine. To block this immediate threat and deny the opponent a valuable bonus, I will RESERVE the card L1_14. Reserving removes it from the board, prevents the opponent from buying it, and grants me 1 GOLD token (available from the board supply) which adds flexibility for future purchases. My token count will remain at 4, well below the 10‑token limit, so no tokens need to be returned. This action both hinders the opponent’s progress toward 15 prestige points and moves me closer to that goal by securing a high‑value card for future acquisition.

Our current hand (2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN) cannot afford any visible card, and taking tokens would not directly prevent the opponent's purchase. Reserving L1_14 removes it from the board, denies the opponent the BLUE bonus, and adds a gold token to our pool without exceeding the 10‑token limit, bringing us closer to the 15‑prestige‑point goal.

2026-01-01 12:45:47.053 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We cannot reserve any more cards because we already have the maximum of three reserved cards (L1_37, L1_23, L2_51). None of the face‑up cards are affordable with our current tokens (WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 0, GOLD 0) and we have no gold tokens to substitute. The only card we can legally purchase this turn is one of our own reserved cards. Among those, L1_37 is affordable: its cost is 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN. We hold 1 BLUE and 1 GREEN, and we have a BLUE bonus token that can cover the second required BLUE, so we can pay the cost without exceeding the 10‑token limit. Purchasing L1_37 will give us a RED bonus gem, advancing our engine and denying the opponent the chance to claim that card later. This move directly contributes to our long‑term goal of reaching 15 prestige points while also blocking a potentially useful card for the opponent.

2026-01-01 12:47:04.993 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current hand holds only 2 WHITE tokens; no visible card can be afforded and none of the opponent's tokens allow them to purchase a visible card this turn. The primary path to 15 prestige is to build a resource base that will enable purchasing high‑value cards such as L2_67 (2 prestige) which requires BLUE and GREEN tokens. The only legal way to gain new tokens without exceeding the 10‑token limit is to take exactly 3 tokens of 3 different colors. Board supplies contain at least one BLUE, one GREEN, and one RED, so taking one of each adds the needed BLUE and GREEN while also providing a RED token that may be useful later. This keeps the total token count at 5 (well below 10), so no returns are required. This move advances the long‑term goal while denying the opponent any immediate advantage.

2026-01-01 12:48:04.996 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 4 tokens (1 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red) and 1 Blue and 1 Green bonus. My primary objective is to acquire a Red bonus to fulfill Noble N9 (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red) or Noble N2 (4 Green, 4 Red). The only visible Red bonus card is L1_39, which costs 3 White tokens. I currently have 0 White. The board bank has exactly 2 White tokens available. Taking 2 White tokens is the optimal play because it directly accumulates the currency needed for L1_39. This puts me at 6 total tokens, keeping me flexible for the next turn. If I can secure a third White token next turn, I can purchase L1_39 for a Red bonus. If not, holding 2 White tokens allows for other purchases like L1_6 (2 White, 2 Green cost). Prioritizing the Red bonus is crucial as it is the color I currently lack for Nobles.

My strategy focuses on building towards Noble N9 (3 Blue, 3 Green, 3 Red) and preparing for Level 2 purchases. I have identified L1_11 (Blue bonus) as a high-value target for next turn, which costs 1 White, 2 Green, and 2 Red. My current Green bonus covers 1 Green, and my tokens cover 1 Green and 1 Red, leaving me needing 1 White and 1 Red to complete the purchase next turn. Taking 1 White, 1 Red, and 1 Black is the optimal move: 1) It provides the exact tokens needed to buy L1_11 next turn. 2) It acquires a Black token, a color I currently lack, which is crucial for purchasing Level 2 cards like L2_65 or L2_60 later. 3) It keeps my token count at 7, well below the limit of 10. This move secures my engine development and denies the opponent White and Red tokens they might need.

2026-01-01 12:49:41.322 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are currently unable to purchase any visible card for prestige points: the cheapest options (L1_11, L1_4, L1_6) yield only bonus gems, and the higher‑value Level 2/3 cards are unaffordable with our present token pool. Our primary long‑term objective is to reach 15 prestige points as quickly as possible while blocking the opponent from securing the most valuable cards. Among the face‑up cards the most valuable in terms of prestige is L3_82 (5 prestige points). It is currently visible, can be reserved without paying its high cost, and its reservation grants us one gold token that can later substitute any gem, dramatically increasing our flexibility when we finally accumulate enough white and black tokens to purchase it. Reserving L3_82 also prevents the opponent from ever claiming this 5‑point card, which is a critical denial move in a race to 15 points. We have an empty reserved‑card slot, so we can legally reserve it now. No token‑taking is required, our token count remains well below the 10‑token limit, and we avoid any returns. This action directly advances our goal of 15 prestige points and strategically blocks a high‑value opponent target.

I cannot reserve any more cards because I already have the maximum of three reserved cards. The visible cards that are affordable must be examined for prestige value. The only Level‑2 cards that can be afforded with my tokens and bonuses are L2_59, L2_65 and L2_67. L2_65 costs WHITE2 RED2 BLACK3, which would require more substitutes than I have; L2_59 needs WHITE3 GREEN2 RED3 and is also out of reach. L2_67 costs WHITE1 BLUE4 GREEN2 and can be covered: I have 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and I can use the 2 BLUE bonuses plus the GOLD token to supply the additional 3 BLUE, while the GREEN bonus supplies the missing GREEN. This purchase yields 2 prestige points— the highest prestige opportunity available to me this turn— and also gives a RED bonus token, improving future purchasing flexibility. All other visible cards either grant only 0 or 1 prestige point or are too expensive. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L2_67, which directly advances my race to 15 prestige points while also denying the opponent a high‑value card later.

2026-01-01 12:50:57.667 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current token pool is WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 0, BLACK 1, GOLD 1 (total 4). None of the face‑up cards are affordable this turn, and the highest‑value card we can realistically acquire soon is L2_67, which is worth 2 prestige points. To purchase L2_67 we must satisfy its cost of WHITE 1, BLUE 4, GREEN 2 after applying our BLUE 2 and GREEN 1 discounts. We currently have 0 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN, so we need to acquire one of each of those three colors. The board supplies at least one WHITE, one BLUE, and one GREEN, so we can legally take exactly three tokens of three different colors. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN will bring our hand to 7 tokens (well below the 10‑token limit), requiring no returns. This move builds the exact resource mix needed to buy L2_67 on the next turn, accelerates our path to 15 prestige points, and does not give the opponent any immediate advantage. Therefore the optimal action is to TAKE_TOKENS with WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN.

2026-01-01 12:51:39.734 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently hold 3 tokens (1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Black) and have 0 points. I cannot afford any visible cards on the board. My goal is to reach Noble N9 (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red) or N7 (3 Green, 3 Black, 3 Red). Both require Red, which I lack. Additionally, most high-value cards on the board (Level 2 and 3) require White tokens. Since no color has 4+ tokens available, I must take 3 distinct colors. Taking Red, White, and Black is the optimal strategy: 1) Red is crucial for both primary Noble targets. 2) White is necessary to purchase Level 2/3 cards like L2_59, L2_60, L3_77, or L3_78. 3) Black maintains my ability to buy Black-cost cards like L1_4 or L2_65. This balanced hand (one of each color except Green) gives me maximum flexibility for a purchase next turn.

2026-01-01 12:52:31.074 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are currently unable to purchase any visible card for prestige points, and none of the face‑up cards can be afforded with our present token pool and discounts. Claiming a noble is impossible because we lack the required gem counts. The only reserved card we could purchase (L1_23) would yield zero prestige and would consume our limited BLUE resources, which we need to build for future high‑value purchases. Our primary long‑term goal is to reach 15 prestige points as quickly as possible, and the most promising path is to set up a purchase of L2_67 (2 prestige) on the next turn. L2_67 requires WHITE 1, BLUE 4, GREEN 2 after applying discounts. We already hold WHITE 1 and have one BLUE and one GREEN token, but we need additional BLUE and GREEN. The board still contains at least one BLUE, one GREEN, and one other color token, allowing us to legally take exactly three tokens of three different colors without exceeding the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. Taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED increases our BLUE count to 2 and GREEN count to 2, bringing us closer to the BLUE 4 / GREEN 2 requirement while also denying the opponent a RED token that could be used for their own purchases. This move therefore advances our prestige goal, builds the exact resource mix needed for the next turn’s purchase, and does not waste a turn on a zero‑prestige action.

Purchasing is therefore impossible. Reserving a high‑value prestige card is the optimal move: it blocks the opponent from grabbing the 5‑point L3_78 card, grants us a gold token for future flexibility, and brings us closer to the 15‑point goal by securing a card that will later yield 5 prestige points. Since we have an empty reserved‑card slot, we can legally reserve L3_78 without spending any tokens. No tokens are taken or returned, and no deck level is used.

Our immediate goal is to acquire the missing BLUE resource needed to purchase L2_67 (2 prestige points) next turn. By taking one BLUE, one RED, and one BLACK token we add exactly three different colors, staying under the 10‑token limit (we will have 9 tokens after the take). This gives us 2 physical BLUE tokens (plus our 2 BLUE bonuses = 4 total), satisfying the BLUE cost of L2_67, while also increasing our RED and BLACK counts for future high‑value cards. No returns are required, and the move directly advances our path to 15 prestige points while denying the opponent a chance to claim these tokens.

2026-01-01 12:54:29.808 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We currently hold 9 tokens (WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK3) and have no affordable visible card. Our immediate goal is to acquire the resources needed to purchase L2_67 (2 prestige points) on the next turn. L2_67 requires, after applying our BLUE and GREEN bonuses, WHITE1, BLUE2, and GREEN1. We already have WHITE1 and GREEN2, but we lack a second BLUE token. The board provides exactly one BLUE token, one RED token, and one BLACK token. By taking these three different‑color tokens we can gain the needed BLUE token while also removing a RED and a BLACK token from the board, which hurts the opponent’s ability to build toward the high‑value L3_82 card they have reserved. Starting from 9 tokens, taking three tokens would normally put us at 12, so we must return two of the taken tokens to stay ≤10. We return the RED and BLACK tokens we just took, netting only the extra BLUE token while keeping our total at exactly 10. This action gives us the missing BLUE token, keeps the token count at the maximum allowed without wasting any of our original tokens, and simultaneously denies the opponent a RED and a BLACK token they could have used. No card can be purchased or reserved this turn, and taking tokens is the only way to progress toward the 15‑point goal.

Therefore the optimal move is to TAKE_TOKENS, acquiring one BLUE, one RED, and one BLACK token, then returning the RED and BLACK tokens we just took.

I cannot purchase any visible cards as I lack the specific resources (e.g., L2_67 costs 4 Blue, but I only have 3 total Blue power). Therefore, I must reserve a card. I choose to reserve L2_67 for three reasons: 1) Denial: The opponent currently has exactly the tokens and bonuses needed to buy L2_67 (2 points) this turn. Reserving it blocks them from gaining points and a valuable Red bonus. 2) Future Purchase: By reserving, I gain a Gold token. Next turn, I will have 10 tokens and must buy. I can use that Gold token plus my existing Blue bonuses to cover the 4 Blue cost of L2_67, allowing me to purchase it for 2 prestige points and a Red bonus. 3) Noble Progression: Purchasing L2_67 next turn gives me a Red bonus. Combined with my current tokens and bonuses, I will meet the requirements for Noble N7 (3 Green, 3 Black, 3 Red), triggering a visit for 3 points immediately after the purchase. This move transitions me from 0 points to 5 points (2 card + 3 noble) in two turns while stalling the opponent.

2026-01-01 12:55:46.826 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board currently only has RED, BLACK, and GOLD tokens available, so taking new colored tokens would not provide any needed colors and would only add a GOLD token, which does not help our engine. The only affordable card that can be bought is our own reserved card L2_67. Its base cost is WHITE 1, BLUE 4, GREEN 2. With our permanent discounts (BLUE 2, GREEN 1) the effective cost becomes WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 1. We hold WHITE 1, BLUE 1, and GREEN 2, lacking only one BLUE. A GOLD token can substitute that missing BLUE, allowing us to pay the cost legally. Purchasing L2_67 grants 2 prestige points and a RED bonus gem, directly advancing our race to 15 prestige while removing a valuable card from our reserved hand that the opponent could never claim. This move requires no token taking, no returns, and immediately adds prestige, making it the optimal action.

2026-01-01 12:56:02.238 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are Player 1 with a full hand of 10 tokens (WHITE3, BLUE3, GREEN2, RED1, GOLD1). Our reserved cards include L2_67, a Level‑2 card worth 2 prestige points. Its cost is WHITE1, BLUE4, GREEN2. We have a BLUE bonus token that reduces the BLUE requirement by 1, so we only need to spend 3 BLUE tokens, which we exactly possess. We also have the required WHITE and GREEN tokens. Purchasing L2_67 will instantly grant us 2 prestige points, moving our score from 1 toward the 15‑point goal, and will also give us a RED bonus token for added flexibility. The purchase reduces our token count but keeps us well below the 10‑token limit, so no token returns are required. This move maximizes immediate prestige gain while utilizing a card we have already reserved, directly advancing our long‑term objective and denying the opponent a potentially valuable card.

2026-01-01 12:56:19.773 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have exactly 10 tokens, so we cannot take additional tokens without violating the 10‑token limit. The board only provides RED, BLACK and GOLD tokens, and taking three different colors would push us past 10, requiring returns that would waste valuable resources. Instead we can use our existing hand to purchase a reserved card. Our reserved card L2_67 costs WHITE 1, BLUE 4, GREEN 2, but our bonuses (BLUE 2, GREEN 1) reduce the effective cost to WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 1. We currently hold WHITE 1, GREEN 2, BLUE 1 and we have one GOLD token that can substitute a missing BLUE. By spending WHITE 1, GREEN 1, BLUE 1 and using GOLD as a BLUE we exactly meet the payment, consuming 4 tokens and leaving us with 6 tokens, well within the limit. Purchasing L2_67 awards 2 prestige points and adds a RED bonus gem, directly moving us toward the 15‑point goal while denying the opponent a valuable card. No other face‑up card is affordable, so the optimal move is to purchase L2_67.

Action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id "L2_67"; no token taking or returning is needed.

2026-01-01 12:56:48.662 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I must purchase a card because I am holding 10 tokens and the board only has 2 tokens available (1 Red, 1 Black), making taking tokens inefficient or impossible without returning tokens. My reserved card L2_67 (cost: 1 White, 4 Blue, 2 Green) is affordable. I have 2 Blue bonuses and 1 Green bonus. The net cost is 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green. I can pay this with 1 White token, 1 Blue token, 1 Green token, and 1 Gold token (substituting the missing Blue). Purchasing this card gives me 2 prestige points and a Red bonus, bringing my score to 2. This also reduces my token count from 10 to 5 (2 Red, 3 Black), putting me in a flexible position for the next turn to acquire tokens or buy another card as the board refills.

2026-01-01 12:57:07.977 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have three reserved cards already, so we cannot reserve any more. None of the face‑up cards are affordable with our current token multiset (WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 3) and our discounts (BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1). The only way to progress toward the 15‑point goal is to acquire the missing resources that will let us eventually purchase the high‑value L3_82 (5 prestige) or other Level 3 cards that require WHITE and BLUE. The board supplies exactly one token of each gem color, so we can legally take exactly three tokens of three different colors this turn without exceeding the 10‑token limit (we currently hold 6 tokens). Taking WHITE gives us the first WHITE token we need, taking BLUE provides the first BLUE token to satisfy the cost of L3_82 after discounts, and taking RED simultaneously denies the opponent a RED token they need for L3_82 and other high‑value cards. This move also keeps our token count at 9, well below the 10‑token cap, so no returns are required. No purchase or reserve action is possible this turn, making TAKE_TOKENS the optimal choice.

Purchasing any visible card would only give us a bonus gem without contributing to the 15‑point goal. The highest‑value card on the board is L3_78, which is worth 5 prestige points and is still visible. Reserving it costs nothing, grants us 1 gold token (which can later substitute any gem), and prevents the opponent from ever reserving or claiming this top‑scoring card. Our reserved‑card slots are empty, so we can legally make this reservation. After reserving, our token count becomes 7 (6 current + 1 gold), well below the 10‑token limit, so no token returns are required. This move directly advances our long‑term objective of reaching 15 prestige points while strategically denying a valuable opponent target.

The only visible card we can actually afford is L1_4. Its base cost is GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 1. Using our discounts—GREEN discount 1 reduces the GREEN cost to 0, and RED discount 1 reduces the RED cost from 3 to 2—we need to pay 2 RED and 1 BLACK. We have exactly 2 RED and 3 BLACK tokens, so the purchase is legal. Buying L1_4 gives us a BLACK bonus gem, which further strengthens our engine and brings us closer to affording higher‑value Level 2 and Level 3 cards later. No token‑taking or returning is required, and we do not exceed any limits. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L1_4.

2026-01-01 12:58:21.461 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently hold 6 tokens (1 Green, 2 Red, 3 Black) and have bonuses of 2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red. My score is 2. The available tokens are extremely limited (1 of each color). I cannot afford any visible card that advances my position without sacrificing my Noble potential. My primary objective is to trigger the available Nobles. By taking 1 Green, 1 Blue, and 1 White token, I will reach the requirements for BOTH Noble N7 (3 Green, 3 Black, 3 Red) and Noble N9 (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red).

Specifically:
- Green: 1 bonus + 2 tokens = 3
- Blue: 2 bonuses + 1 token = 3
- Red: 1 bonus + 2 tokens = 3
- Black: 0 bonus + 3 tokens = 3

This move immediately adds 6 prestige points (3 from N7, 3 from N9), raising my score to 8. Taking White as the third token is strategic because the Level 3 cards currently available (L3_77, L3_78, L3_83) all require significant White investment (5+), and I currently have 0 White tokens. Securing this token positions me to purchase high-value cards in future turns while denying it to my opponent.

2026-01-01 12:58:51.446 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We examine the current board and our hand. The board supplies only RED, BLACK, and GOLD tokens; WHITE and BLUE are exhausted. Our hand contains 9 tokens (WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK3, GOLD0) and we have discounts: BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. Scanning the face‑up cards, the only card whose reduced cost can be met with our present tokens is L1_4 (cost GREEN1, RED3, BLACK1). After applying the RED discount we need 2 RED and 1 BLACK, which we possess exactly. Purchasing L1_4 will spend those tokens, leaving us with 6 tokens total, well under the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. The purchase yields a BLACK bonus gem, increasing our discount pool and strengthening future engine growth. It also removes a potentially useful card from the board, denying the opponent any chance to claim it later. No other visible card is affordable, and we cannot afford any of our reserved cards without first acquiring additional WHITE or BLUE tokens, which is impossible this turn because the board holds zero WHITE and BLUE tokens. Taking tokens would only add RED, BLACK, or GOLD, but we would immediately exceed the 10‑token cap and would need to return tokens, netting no net gain while forgoing the immediate prestige‑building opportunity. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L1_4, advancing our long‑term goal of reaching 15 prestige points while simultaneously blocking a card that could aid the opponent.

2026-01-01 12:59:25.226 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current board token supply only contains RED, BLACK, and GOLD. My hand holds 9 tokens (WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK3, GOLD0). I cannot afford any visible card that yields prestige points, and taking tokens would either exceed the 10‑token limit or give me only a single GOLD token after required returns, which is inefficient. Reserving a high‑value card gives immediate benefits: it grants one GOLD token (increasing my total to exactly 10 tokens, which stays within the limit) and places a 5‑prestige card (L3_78) into my reserved hand, blocking my opponent from eventually claiming it. This directly advances my long‑term goal of reaching 15 prestige points while also adding a GOLD token that can be used as a wildcard later. The reservation is legal because L3_78 is face‑up, I have an empty reserved‑card slot, and I will receive the GOLD token without exceeding the token cap, so no returns are required.

Therefore the optimal action is to RESERVE_CARD the visible L3_78 card.

2026-01-01 13:00:13.961 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current token pool: WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK3, GOLD0 (total 9). Board supplies only RED(1), BLACK(1), GOLD(4). To stay ≤10 tokens after taking, must take exactly 3 different colors or 2 of same color. Taking RED, BLACK, and GOLD adds the missing RED token needed to afford L2_55 next turn (which requires RED3 after discounts) and also provides extra BLACK and a wild GOLD. After taking these three, the hand would have 12 tokens, so we must return 2 tokens. Returning the two GREEN tokens we already hold reduces the total back to 10 while preserving our existing WHITE and BLUE tokens, which are currently unavailable on the board and thus valuable to keep. This leaves us with RED3 (enough to buy L2_55), BLACK4, GOLD1, and our original WHITE and BLUE. Next turn we can substitute the GOLD for the missing GREEN cost and purchase L2_55 for 2 prestige points, directly advancing toward the 15‑point goal. Purchasing L1_4 would give only a BLACK discount but no immediate prestige, so the token‑taking move is superior. Therefore the optimal action is TAKE_TOKENS with RED, BLACK, and GOLD taken and GREEN returned twice.

I choose to reserve L2_59 for several reasons: 1) It generates a Gold token, bringing my total to 10. 2) On my next turn, I will be forced to buy (due to 10 tokens), and I can purchase L2_59 using the Gold token to cover the 3 White cost, gaining 1 prestige point and a Green bonus. 3) This secures the Green bonus, advancing my progress towards Nobles N7, N9, and N2. 4) It denies the opponent (Player 1), who has 3 White tokens and close to the required Green/Red bonuses, from purchasing this card.

2026-01-01 13:02:06.882 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are at the token limit of 10. The board only has RED, BLACK, and GOLD tokens left. To eventually purchase the high‑value Level 2 card L2_55 (2 prestige points, cost GREEN1 + RED4 + BLACK2) we need one more RED token, because our current RED count (2) plus the RED bonus (1) gives only 3 RED resources, short of the 4 required. Taking the remaining RED token is therefore essential. The only legal TAKE_TOKENS combination with three different colors is RED, BLACK, GOLD. After taking these, our hand would rise to 13 tokens, so we must return exactly 3 tokens to stay ≤10. We return a WHITE, a BLUE, and a GREEN token — colors we have in surplus (1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN) — leaving us with 10 tokens but retaining the newly acquired RED (and also an extra BLACK and GOLD). This gives us the needed RED resource while preserving our token count, setting us up to purchase L2_55 next turn for 2 prestige and a WHITE bonus, a critical step toward the 15‑point goal. No card can be purchased or reserved this turn, and returning tokens is unavoidable; this move is therefore the most efficient and strategic. Action: TAKE_TOKENS with RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1, and return WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1.

2026-01-01 13:02:42.449 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have 10 tokens and can only take tokens if at least three different colors are available on the board, which is not the case here (only RED and BLACK have tokens). Therefore TAKE_TOKENS is illegal. We also cannot RESERVE_CARD because all three reserved slots are already occupied. The viable actions are to PURCHASE a card from the board or from our reserved hand. Among the visible cards we can afford, L2_47 is the only one that provides prestige points (1) and also yields a BLUE bonus gem, which strengthens our existing BLUE discounts. Its cost after discounts is 1 GREEN and 2 RED; we have 2 GREEN, 1 RED and 1 GOLD, so we can substitute the second RED with the GOLD token. This purchase spends 1 GREEN, 1 RED and the GOLD token, keeping our total token count well below the 10‑token limit and leaving us with a net gain of a BLUE token and 1 prestige point. It therefore advances our goal of reaching 15 prestige while also improving our resource base for future turns.

Cost analysis: L2_55 costs 1 Green, 4 Red, 2 Black. With my bonuses (1 Green, 1 Red), effective cost is 0 Green, 3 Red, 2 Black. I pay with 2 Red tokens, 2 Black tokens, and 1 Gold token (substituting missing Red). This reduces my tokens from 10 to 5 and increases my score from 2 to 4.

The highest‑value cards I can realistically purchase soon are the Level‑2 cards that give 1 prestige each (L2_53, L2_60, L2_65). To buy any of them I need a second BLACK token and a RED token (L2_53 requires GREEN2, RED1, BLACK2; L2_60 needs WHITE1, BLUE1, BLACK2). By taking one BLACK, one RED, and one additional color I will reach the required BLACK2 and acquire a RED while also gaining a GREEN token that can be used for future discounts and to deny the opponent a GREEN from the supply. The chosen colors are BLACK, RED, and GREEN, all of which are available on the board (counts 3, 4, 2 respectively). Taking exactly three different‑color tokens adds 3 to my current 5 tokens, resulting in 8 total, which is below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are needed. This move positions me to purchase L2_53 next turn (earning 1 prestige and a WHITE bonus gem) and also blocks a RED token that the opponent could have used, advancing my race to 15 prestige points while limiting the opponent's options.

2026-01-01 13:06:54.769 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card because all Level 2 and 3 cards require White tokens (0 available on board), and Level 1 cards offer 0 prestige points, which is inefficient for my current score of 4. Reserving is also suboptimal as it just adds Gold without solving the resource scarcity. Therefore, I must take tokens to build my economy. My primary goal is to trigger Noble N9 (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red) for 3 points. I currently have 1 Green, 2 Blue, and 1 Red bonus/token. Taking 1 Green, 1 Red, and 1 Black brings my totals to 2 Green, 3 Blue, 2 Red (bonuses + tokens). This puts me within reach of triggering N9 next turn with just 1 more Green and 1 more Red. Taking Black also builds towards Noble N7 and helps with the Black cost of high-value cards like L3_77.

2026-01-01 13:07:57.479 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have 8 tokens (WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN3, RED1, BLACK1). The board only provides BLUE, RED, and BLACK tokens this turn. No visible card with prestige points can be afforded, and we have no empty reservation slot. Our primary goal is to move toward 15 prestige points, which requires acquiring high‑value prestige cards that need additional BLACK tokens (e.g., L2_60, L2_53). Gaining an extra BLACK token is therefore the most valuable immediate resource. By taking the three available different‑color tokens—BLUE, RED, and BLACK—we would gain one of each, but this would raise our total from 8 to 11, exceeding the 10‑token limit. To stay within the limit we must return one token; returning a GREEN token that we have in excess (we hold 3) preserves the newly acquired RED and BLACK tokens while only reducing our surplus GREEN from 3 to 2. This net result gives us +1 BLUE, +1 RED, +1 BLACK and keeps us at exactly 10 tokens. The extra BLACK token brings us closer to affording a prestige‑point card next turn, and taking a RED token also denies the opponent a RED token they could use for high‑value cards. No purchase or reservation is possible this turn, so the optimal move is to TAKE_TOKENS with the described take and return values.

Purchasing this card increases my score to 5, adds a valuable White bonus (helpful for the White-heavy Level 3 cards on the board like L3_77 and L3_78), and reduces my token count from 8 to 3, putting me in a flexible position for the next turn.

2026-01-01 13:10:00.653 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board provides only GREEN, RED, BLACK and GOLD tokens. Player 1 holds exactly 10 tokens (WHITE3, BLUE3, RED2, BLACK2). The only visible card that can be afforded and yields prestige points is L2_60 (LEVEL_2, prestigePoints=1). Its effective cost after discounts is 1 BLUE and 2 BLACK; player 1 has exactly those tokens. Purchasing L2_60 therefore gives an immediate 1 prestige point, adds a BLUE bonus gem, and does not require any token returns because the purchase reduces the token count from 10 to 8 and then returns 1 BLUE bonus gem, keeping the total at 8 ≤ 10. All other prestige‑point cards (L2_65, L2_68, L2_50, L3_77, L3_83, L3_88) are currently unaffordable without first taking additional tokens, which would require a full turn and still leave us with only 1 prestige point the following turn. Taking tokens now would not add prestige immediately and would consume a turn, making it strictly slower toward the 15‑point goal. Hence the optimal action is to purchase L2_60 this turn.

- Token availability: BLUE≥1, BLACK≥2, so the cost can be met.
- No token excess, so no returns are needed.
- All required fields for a PURCHASE_CARD action are satisfied.

Therefore the best move is to purchase card L2_60.

2026-01-01 13:12:11.955 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We currently hold 5 tokens (WHITE1, BLUE2, RED2) and have discounts of WHITE2, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1. Our immediate goal is to gain a BLACK discount, which is essential for unlocking the high‑value Level‑2 and Level‑3 prestige cards (e.g., L2_65, L2_50, L3_77). The only way to obtain a BLACK discount quickly is to purchase a card that gives a BLACK bonus gem (L1_4 or L1_6). Both of those cards require a GREEN token (for L1_6) or a BLACK token (for L1_4) after discounts. The board still contains GREEN (2), BLACK (3) and WHITE (2) tokens, so we can acquire them this turn. By taking one GREEN, one BLACK, and one WHITE token we gain the missing GREEN token needed to buy L1_6 next turn for free, which will grant a BLACK bonus gem and raise our BLACK discount from 0 to 1. This also removes a GREEN and a BLACK token from the supply, hurting the opponent’s ability to build toward their reserved L3_82 card. Taking three different‑color tokens adds only 3 to our current 5, keeping us at 8 tokens—well below the 10‑token limit—so no returns are required. No visible prestige‑point card can be afforded now, and reserving a card would not provide immediate resources. Therefore the optimal move is to TAKE_TOKENS, acquiring exactly one GREEN, one BLACK, and one WHITE token.

By taking 1 Green, 1 Red, and 1 Black token, I secure the final Red needed to reach 3 Red, triggering Noble N9 at the end of the turn and increasing my score from 5 to 8. This move is critical because my opponent also needs only 1 Green token to trigger the same Noble; taking the Green token from the board denies them that opportunity immediately. I also take Black to continue building towards Noble N7.

Taking three different‑color tokens would push us to 12 tokens, forcing us to return at least two tokens and waste a turn. No prestige‑point card is affordable with our current hand and discounts, and purchasing a non‑prestige card that costs tokens would only consume resources without advancing our goal. The optimal immediate move is to acquire a useful bonus gem at no token cost. L1_29 can be bought for free because our WHITE2 and BLUE2 discounts reduce its WHITE2,BLUE1 cost to zero. Buying it grants a GREEN bonus gem, raising our GREEN discount from 1 to 2, which will lower the cost of future GREEN‑heavy prestige cards (e.g., L2_44, L3_83) and bring us closer to the 15‑point target. This action also does not affect our token count, so we stay safely below the 10‑token limit and retain flexibility for the next turn.

2026-01-01 13:14:29.475 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 9 tokens (1W, 1B, 3G, 2R, 2K) and bonuses (2W, 2B, 1G, 1R). I am on the verge of triggering two Nobles: N9 requires 3G, 3B, 3R and N7 requires 3G, 3K, 3R. 

Current Totals (Bonus + Tokens):
- Green: 1 + 3 = 4
- Blue: 2 + 1 = 3
- Red: 1 + 2 = 3
- Black: 0 + 2 = 2

I am 1 Black token short for Noble N7. The board has 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black token available. By taking these three tokens, I secure the Black needed for N7. 

Taking 3 tokens brings my total to 12, so I must return 2 to respect the 10-token limit. To maintain the Noble requirements, I must keep:
- 2 Red tokens (since I have only 1 Red bonus, totaling 3).
- 3 Black tokens (since I have 0 Black bonus, totaling 3).
- At least 1 Green token (1 bonus + 2 tokens = 3).
- At least 1 Blue token (2 bonuses + 1 token = 3).

Therefore, I will return 1 Green and 1 Blue token. 

Final State:
- Tokens: 2W, 1B, 2G, 2R, 3K (Total 10).
- Totals: Green=3, Blue=3, Red=3, Black=3.

This triggers BOTH Noble N9 and Noble N7, increasing my score from 5 to 11 points. This creates an insurmountable lead and puts me within 4 points of victory.

2026-01-01 13:14:59.831 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current hand tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. Board tokens available: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, GOLD=5, with no RED or BLACK tokens. The only visible prestige cards require colors we cannot currently afford (e.g., they need WHITE, RED, or BLACK tokens in quantities we lack). Taking tokens would only add WHITE, BLUE, or GREEN, none of which directly enable a prestige purchase this turn, and would not produce immediate prestige points. We can afford card L1_4: its cost is GREEN1, RED3, BLACK1. With our RED1 discount, RED3 becomes effectively RED2, which we can pay using our exactly‑2 RED tokens; the GREEN requirement is covered by our GREEN2 discount, so no GREEN token is needed; and we have the required BLACK1 token. Thus we can purchase L1_4 for 2 RED + 1 BLACK, discarding those tokens and staying below the 10‑token limit. This yields a BLACK bonus gem, increasing our BLACK discount from 0 to 1, which will be crucial for future high‑value prestige cards that heavily use BLACK costs (e.g., L2_65, L2_68, L3_77, L3_88). No other affordable prestige card exists, and reserving is impossible because all reservation slots are already occupied. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L1_4 now to gain a valuable discount while conserving tokens for future turns.

2026-01-01 13:18:41.691 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We are currently at exactly 10 tokens, so any token-taking action would require returns and waste a turn. Moreover, several Level‑2 and Level‑3 prestige cards are affordable with our existing discounts and token pool. The highest prestige‑point cards we can purchase this turn are L2_68 (2 prestige points) and L2_50 (2 prestige points). Evaluating their costs after applying our discounts:
- L2_68 costs WHITE:3, BLACK:5. With WHITE discount 2 we need only 1 WHITE, and with BLACK discount 1 we need 4 BLACK. We hold WHITE1, BLACK3 and have 1 GOLD token that can act as an additional BLACK, thus we can pay the cost by spending 1 WHITE, 3 BLACK and the GOLD token (5 tokens total). This brings our token count down to 5, well within the 10‑token limit, and gives us 2 immediate prestige points. The card also provides a RED bonus gem, raising our RED discount from 1 to 2, which will facilitate future purchases of many high‑value cards that require RED.
- L2_50 would also give 2 prestige points but only adds a BLUE bonus (we already have BLUE2) and does not improve a weaker discount. Since the prestige‑point gain is equal, we choose the card that improves a lower‑level discount and offers better future flexibility.
- No Level‑3 prestige card is affordable (they require more WHITE or GREEN than we can supply), and taking tokens would not yield immediate points while consuming a turn.

Therefore the optimal action is to purchase L2_68, which gives 2 prestige points, strengthens our RED discount, and does not exceed the token limit.

2026-01-01 13:19:20.772 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We currently hold only 3 tokens (WHITE0, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED0, BLACK0, GOLD0). No prestige‑point card on the board can be paid for with these resources, and none of the level‑1 cards can be afforded because each still requires a BLACK token after discounts. Purchasing any card this turn is therefore impossible. Reserving a card would only give a gold token and occupy a reservation slot without immediate progress toward 15 prestige points. The most pressing need is to obtain a BLACK token so that next turn we can buy L1_25, which costs only a BLACK token after discounts and will grant a GREEN bonus gem (raising our GREEN discount from 1 to 2). The board still has one BLACK, one RED, and one GREEN token, so we can take exactly three different‑color tokens. Taking RED, GREEN, and BLACK gives us the needed BLACK token, adds a RED token for future high‑value cards, and provides an extra GREEN token that may aid later GREEN‑heavy purchases. Our token total would rise from 3 to 6, well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. This move maximizes future purchasing power while keeping us safely under the token cap. Hence the optimal action is to TAKE_TOKENS with RED, GREEN, and BLACK taken.

To preserve my Noble conditions, I must keep at least 2 Green, 1 Blue, 2 Red, and 3 Black tokens. Additionally, to secure a win next turn, I need to keep 1 White token (to combine with my 2 White bonuses and 1 Gold for purchasing L3_77). Therefore, I will return 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Red token. This results in a hand of 1 White, 1 Blue, 2 Green, 2 Red, 3 Black, and 1 Gold. This configuration triggers both Nobles, increasing my score to 11. Next turn, I will purchase L3_77 (4 points) using my 1 White token, 2 White bonuses, and 1 Gold to reach 15 points and victory.

2026-01-01 13:23:40.757 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have 10 tokens and cannot take more without returning, but we already hold enough tokens to afford a prestige-point card. The board shows WHITE 3, BLUE 1, RED 1, GOLD 4, with no GREEN or BLACK tokens available. Our discounts are WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, and we have BLACK 3. Among the visible prestige cards, the only one we can pay for after applying discounts is L2_65 (LEVEL_2, prestigePoints=1, cost WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3). With WHITE discount 2 the WHITE requirement becomes 0, RED discount 1 reduces RED from 2 to 1, and we have exactly 1 RED token and 3 BLACK tokens available. Thus we can purchase L2_65 by spending 1 RED and 3 BLACK tokens, leaving us with 6 tokens total, well under the 10‑token limit, so no token returns are needed. This yields an immediate 1 prestige point and adds a RED bonus gem, increasing our RED discount for future turns. All other prestige cards require either more WHITE, BLACK, or GREEN tokens than we can supply, or have higher point values that are currently unaffordable. Therefore the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD the card L2_65, taking no tokens this turn.

2026-01-01 13:24:18.055 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board currently only displays WHITE, BLUE, and RED tokens; GREEN and BLACK supplies are empty, so they cannot be taken. To unlock any affordable level‑1 card that provides a useful bonus gem, we need a WHITE token, because every card we can currently afford (L1_13, L1_25, L1_34, L1_39) requires at least one WHITE token after discounts. Taking exactly one WHITE, one BLUE, and one RED token adds three tokens to our current six, bringing us to nine tokens—well below the ten‑token cap—so no returns are required. This grants us the missing WHITE token, which will allow us on a subsequent turn to purchase either L1_13 (granting an additional BLUE bonus gem) or L1_25 (granting an additional GREEN bonus gem), thereby increasing our discounts and moving us closer to the 15‑point target. No visible prestige‑point card can be purchased this turn, and reserving a card would forgo the immediate acquisition of a WHITE token, which is more valuable for our near‑term development. Hence the optimal action is to take one WHITE, one BLUE, and one RED token.

2026-01-01 13:28:46.758 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 10 tokens and 5 points. I meet the requirements for both Nobles N7 and N9 (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Black). I must purchase a card this turn to reduce my token count from 10 to 9, freeing up space to take tokens next turn without having to return critical tokens needed for Nobles.

Card L1_39 (Red, 0 pts, Cost: 3 White) is affordable using my 2 White bonuses and 1 White token. Buying this card gives me a Red bonus (increasing my Red total to 2), which is useful for future purchases. Crucially, paying with 1 White token preserves my Green, Red, Black, and Blue tokens, which are all required to trigger Nobles N7 and N9 at the end of this turn.

After this purchase, my token count will be 9, and I will have 11 points (5 + 3 + 3). This creates a significant lead (11 vs 3). In the next turn, I can take 2 White tokens from the board to afford L3_83 (3 points), moving me closer to 15.

2026-01-01 13:29:26.972 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board currently only has WHITE and GOLD tokens available, so taking three different‑color tokens is impossible. The only viable token‑taking pattern would be to take 2 GOLD tokens, which would push the hand from 9 to 11 tokens and force a return of 1 token—an inefficient use of the turn. Instead, the optimal move is to spend a single BLACK token to purchase the visible Level‑1 card L1_25. Its discounted cost is only 1 BLACK (white, blue, and red costs are eliminated by our discounts), so the purchase is affordable. Buying L1_25 grants a GREEN bonus gem, raising our GREEN discount from 1 to 2. This unlocks the ability to later purchase L1_24 (a 1‑point prestige card) for just 2 GREEN tokens, and it also strengthens our engine for future high‑value Level‑2 and Level‑3 cards that rely on GREEN. No prestige‑point card can be bought this turn directly, and purchasing L1_25 does not require any token returns, keeps our token count at 8 (well below the 10‑token limit), and advances our goal of reaching 15 prestige points while denying the opponent the chance to claim a key discount‑building card. Therefore the best action is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_25.

However, the board lacks affordable cards that I can purchase without spending the tokens required to maintain these Noble conditions (specifically the 3 Black tokens). My primary goal is to secure the 6 prestige points from the Nobles this turn and position myself to win in subsequent turns. The board has 4 White tokens available. By taking 2 White tokens, I increase my total to 11 tokens, requiring me to return 1 token to respect the 10-token limit. I will return 1 Red token, preserving my 1 Gold token for future flexibility. This action leaves me with 2W, 1B, 2G, 1R, 3K, 1Gld, which satisfies all Noble requirements (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Black). Triggering the Nobles will increase my score from 5 to 11. Taking the White tokens also denies my opponent resources, as they likely need White to progress.

2026-01-01 13:33:46.907 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current hand holds 1 BLACK token, and after applying our discounts (WHITE2, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED2) the only affordable visible card is L1_34, which costs WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN1, BLACK1. Discounts reduce the WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN requirements to 0, leaving just 1 BLACK token to pay. We can discard that BLACK token and purchase L1_34, which grants a RED bonus gem, raising our RED discount from 2 to 3. This Discount improvement will significantly lower the effective cost of many future prestige cards that rely on RED (e.g., L2_65, L2_50, L2_44, L3_83), moving us closer to the 15‑point goal. No prestige‑point card is currently affordable, and taking tokens would not provide immediate engine progression; purchasing L1_34 delivers the best strategic payoff this turn while staying well within the 10‑token limit.

2026-01-01 13:34:08.911 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have 8 tokens (WHITE=0, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1). The board shows WHITE=2, RED=1, GOLD=4, but no BLUE, GREEN, or BLACK tokens. Our discounts are WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 1, BLACK 1. 

Evaluating all visible cards:
- L1_13 costs 1 BLACK after discounts; we could buy it but it gives no immediate prestige.
- L1_24 costs 1 GREEN after discounts; it would give 1 prestige point.
- L1_34 costs 0 after discounts; it is free but only gives a RED bonus gem.
- L2_44 costs 5 GREEN and 3 RED. With our discounts the effective cost is max(5-3,0)=2 GREEN and max(3-1,0)=2 RED. We hold exactly 2 GREEN and 2 RED, so we can afford it. Purchasing L2_44 awards 2 prestige points and a BLACK bonus gem, raising our BLACK discount from 1 to 2, which will significantly reduce future high‑BLACK‑cost cards. This is the only action that yields immediate prestige gain while also strengthening our engine for later turns.

All other options either give no points, only 1 point, or require spending tokens without immediate progress. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L2_44 now.

The purchase is legal: the card exists in the face‑up list, its discounted cost (2 GREEN + 2 RED) is exactly covered by our current tokens, and we will not exceed the 10‑token limit (we will finish the turn with 4 tokens). No token return or reservation is needed.

Action chosen: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id "L2_44".

My goal is to reach 15 points. The L3_77 card (4 points, Blue bonus) costs 6 White, 3 Blue, and 3 Black. I have enough Blue and Black tokens/bonuses, but I am short on White (I have 2 tokens + 2 bonuses = 4, need 6). The board only has 2 White tokens available, so I cannot take 2 in one turn (requires 4+ supply). I cannot take 1 White and return a token to make progress, as I would just swap tokens. 

Therefore, I will reserve L3_77. This grants me a Gold token and secures the card for a future purchase. After receiving the Gold token, my total token count will be 11, so I must return 1 token to respect the 10-token limit. I will return 1 White token. 

Final Token State: 1W, 1B, 2G, 1R, 3Bk, 2Gld. This maintains all Noble conditions (Green=3, Blue=3, Red=3, Black=3). The Nobles will visit, increasing my score to 11. On my next turn, I can take available White tokens (likely 1 or 2) and use my accumulated Gold to bridge the remaining gap and purchase L3_77 for the win.

2026-01-01 13:39:15.474 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 5, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=3}
2026-01-01 13:39:43.982 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We first examine the board token supply: WHITE=3, GREEN=2, RED=3, GOLD=3; BLUE and BLACK are zero, so we cannot take those colors. Our current hand holds 4 tokens (WHITE0, BLUE3, GREEN0, RED0, BLACK1, GOLD0). Our discounts are WHITE2, BLUE2, GREEN3, RED2, BLACK2, which heavily reduce many costs.

We then compute the effective cost of every prestige‑point card after applying our discounts:
- L2_65 (WHITE2 RED2 BLACK3) becomes 0 WHITE, 0 RED, 1 BLACK → costs exactly 1 BLACK token, which we have.
- All other prestige cards require either WHITE, GREEN, or additional BLACK tokens we do not possess, or require more tokens than we can acquire in a single turn.

Thus the only affordable prestige card that yields immediate points is L2_65, worth 1 prestige point, and it also grants a RED bonus gem, raising our RED discount from 2 to 3 for future turns.

Purchasing L2_65 costs 1 BLACK token, leaving us with 3 tokens total, well under the 10‑token limit, and no token returns are needed. No reservation or token‑taking action can produce immediate prestige points, and taking tokens would not enable a higher‑value prestige purchase this turn because we cannot gain additional BLACK tokens (none are on the board). Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L2_65 now.

2026-01-01 13:39:57.472 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board displays the following affordable cards after applying my discounts (WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 0). L1_13 needs 2 BLACK – I only have 1, so unaffordable. L1_34 needs 1 BLACK – affordable but yields only 1 prestige point. L1_24 needs 3 GREEN – I have 0 GREEN, unaffordable. L1_36 needs 3 BLACK – unaffordable. Among LEVEL_2 cards, L2_65, L2_68, L2_50 require multiple BLACK tokens, which I lack. L2_61 costs WHITE4, BLUE2, BLACK1; after my WHITE and BLUE discounts those become 0, leaving only 1 BLACK needed. I possess exactly one BLACK token, so L2_61 is affordable. Purchasing L2_61 gives 2 prestige points and a GREEN bonus gem, raising my GREEN discount from 1 to 2, which will enable future high‑GREEN‑cost cards. My current token pool is WHITE0, BLUE3, GREEN0, RED0, BLACK1, GOLD0 (total 4 tokens). Spending the single BLACK token leaves me with 3 tokens, well below the 10‑token limit, so no token returns are required. No other visible card provides more than 2 immediate prestige points, and reserving a card would forgo this direct gain. Therefore the optimal move is to PURCHASE_CARD "L2_61".

The board only has 3 White tokens, so I can only take 1 this turn (taking 2 requires 4+ supply). I will take 1 White, 1 Green, and 1 Red token. This brings my total to 13 tokens. I must return 3 to stay under the limit of 10. To maintain the Noble conditions (3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Black), I must keep at least 1 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red, and 3 Black tokens. I will return 1 Green, 1 Red, and 1 Gold token. This leaves me with 2 White tokens, 1 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red, 3 Black, and 1 Gold. The Nobles will trigger, increasing my score to 11. Next turn, I can take the remaining White tokens and use my Gold to purchase L3_77 for the win.

2026-01-01 13:46:08.413 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We currently hold 4 tokens (BLUE=3, BLACK=1) and have discounts WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 1, BLACK 2. The board supplies WHITE, GREEN, RED, and GOLD tokens, but no BLUE or BLACK. To make progress toward 15 prestige points we need to acquire either a prestige‑point card or move toward a noble. The only visible prestige‑point cards we could eventually buy are L2_65 (1 prestige, cost RED+BLACK) and L1_24 (1 prestige, cost GREEN). Both require a RED or GREEN token that we do not currently possess. The most efficient immediate step is to take three different‑color tokens that give us the needed RED and GREEN tokens while also providing a third distinct color for future flexibility. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and RED accomplishes this: it adds one RED token (enabling the future purchase of L2_65), one GREEN token (enabling the purchase of L1_24), and one WHITE token (useful for later high‑WHITE‑cost cards). Our hand would then contain 7 tokens, well under the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. This move brings us closer to fulfilling noble N9 (which needs RED3, GREEN3, BLUE3) and sets up a 1‑prestige purchase on the next turn, which is the highest‑value action available now.

Action chosen: take one WHITE, one GREEN, and one RED token.

No prestige‑point card can be bought this turn; the only affordable 1‑point cards are L1_24 (cost 1 GREEN) and L2_65 (cost 1 BLACK). However, the 2‑point card L2_44 is the most valuable immediate opportunity. After discounts its cost is 2 GREEN and 1 RED. We hold only 1 GREEN and 0 RED, so we must acquire exactly one more GREEN and one RED token. The only legal way to gain both in a single turn is to take three different‑color tokens that include GREEN and RED. Taking RED, GREEN, and WHITE satisfies this requirement, gives us the needed 2 GREEN and 1 RED while staying well below the 10‑token limit, and does not require any returns. Next turn we can purchase L2_44, gaining 2 prestige points and a BLACK bonus gem that will raise our BLACK discount, moving us closer to the 15‑point goal and strengthening our engine for higher‑value cards. Therefore the optimal action is to TAKE_TOKENS with RED, GREEN, and WHITE taken.

2026-01-01 13:52:36.223 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I currently have 8 points and need to reach 15. I have a reserved Level 3 card (L3_77) worth 4 points that is the most efficient path to increasing my score. L3_77 costs 6 White, 3 Blue, and 3 Black. My bonuses (2 White, 2 Blue, 1 Black) reduce the net cost to 4 White, 1 Blue, and 2 Black. I currently hold 1 White and 1 Black token, so I need to acquire 3 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black more. The board currently has 2 White, 1 Blue, and 2 Black tokens available. By taking 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black token, I secure the scarce Blue token (only 1 available) and make progress on the other colors. This brings my token count to 6 (2W, 1B, 1G, 2Bk), which is safely under the 10-token limit. On my next turn, I will need 2 more White tokens to purchase L3_77, increasing my score to 12.

2026-01-01 13:53:59.969 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board provides only WHITE, GREEN, RED, and BLACK tokens. Our current hand holds 9 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=1) and we are limited to 10 tokens, so taking additional tokens would force returns and is sub‑optimal. The only face‑up cards we can afford with our discounts (WHITE2, BLUE2, GREEN2, RED1, BLACK2) are:
- L1_13 (free, gives BLUE bonus)
- L1_34 (free, gives RED bonus)
- L1_24 (cost 2 GREEN, 1 prestige point, gives WHITE bonus)
- L2_65 (cost 1 RED + 1 BLACK after discounts, 1 prestige point, gives RED bonus)

Among these, L2_65 yields an immediate prestige point and improves the RED discount from 1 to 2, which will significantly reduce the cost of many future high‑value Level‑2 and Level‑3 cards that involve RED. This both increases our score now and strengthens our engine for later turns, whereas the free cards give no points and L1_24 consumes two GREEN tokens that we need for noble completion. Therefore the optimal action is to purchase L2_65, gaining 1 prestige point and a valuable RED bonus gem while preserving our token count for future turns.

2026-01-01 13:57:34.925 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I need to increase my score from 8 to reach 15 efficiently. My reserved high-value card L3_77 (4 pts) requires 4 White tokens net, but I can only acquire 1 White per turn due to the board supply (3) and token rules (cannot take 2 of a color unless 4+ are available, and taking 3 different colors limits me to 1 White). This makes purchasing L3_77 a slow 3-turn process.

Instead, I can purchase L2_61 (Green, 2 pts) from the board immediately. Its cost is 4 White, 2 Blue, 1 Black. My bonuses (2 White, 2 Blue, 1 Black) reduce the net cost to just 2 White tokens. I currently hold 1 White token, so I need exactly 1 more White token. 

I will take 1 White, 1 Green, and 1 Black token. This brings my token count to 8 (within the 10 limit). The White token completes the purchase of L2_61. The Green and Black tokens are strategic denials against my opponent, who needs Green (bank has 1) and Black (bank has 2) to complete their noble requirements. Buying L2_61 increases my score to 10, improves my Green bonus to 3 (progress towards Nobles), and sets me up for a win in subsequent turns.

2026-01-01 13:57:52.640 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have 6 tokens (WHITE=0, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=0) and all discounts are at 2. The board supplies WHITE, RED, and GOLD tokens but no BLUE or GREEN. The only visible cards we can afford are those whose discounted cost is zero or can be covered by our current token counts.

Evaluating each face‑up card:
- L1_13 and L1_34 cost 0 but give no prestige.
- L2_61 costs 0 after discounts and awards 2 prestige points plus a GREEN bonus gem, increasing our GREEN discount from 2 to 3.
- L1_24 costs 2 GREEN; we could afford it, but it only yields 1 prestige point.
- L1_36 needs 1 BLACK token, which we do not have.
- All Level‑2 and Level‑3 cards that grant higher prestige require either BLACK, WHITE, or large quantities of tokens we cannot currently meet.

Thus the highest‑value immediate action is to purchase L2_61. It is free, gives 2 prestige points (raising our score from 8 to 10), and improves our GREEN discount, strengthening future purchases. No token taking or returning is required, and we stay well under the 10‑token limit.

Therefore the optimal move is to PURCHASE_CARD L2_61.

2026-01-01 13:58:15.112 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board currently only contains WHITE, RED, and GOLD tokens. Our discounts are WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1. Evaluating the visible prestige cards, L2_61 (Level 2) has an effective cost of 2 WHITE tokens after applying discounts (WHITE 4 -> 2, BLUE 2 -> 0, BLACK 1 -> 0). We have exactly 2 WHITE tokens, so we can afford it without any token returns. Purchasing L2_61 grants 2 prestige points and a GREEN bonus gem, raising our GREEN discount from 2 to 3, which improves future purchases and moves us toward completing noble N7 (which requires GREEN 3). Other affordable prestige cards either give fewer points (e.g., L1_24 gives 1) or require colors we lack (e.g., L2_50 needs 3 BLACK, which we have but yields only a BLUE gem, less strategically valuable than the GREEN gem). Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L2_61 directly, gaining immediate prestige and a key discount upgrade while preserving token count under the 10‑token limit.

- L2_61 costs WHITE4, BLUE2, BLACK1 originally. After discounts this becomes 2 WHITE (WHITE4‑2 = 2, BLUE2‑2 = 0, BLACK1‑1 = 0). I have exactly 2 WHITE tokens, so I can purchase L2_61 this turn. The purchase gives 2 prestige points and a GREEN bonus gem, which will raise my GREEN discount from 2 to 3, further reducing the cost of future GREEN‑heavy cards and helping me move toward the 15‑point goal. This is the highest‑value immediate action available, yields prestige points, and does not require any token returns or reservations. Therefore the optimal move is to PURCHASE_CARD L2_61.

2026-01-01 14:00:45.144 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: My goal is to reach 15 prestige points efficiently. I currently have 8 points. I see a clear path to 13 points by triggering Noble N9. My bonuses are currently White 2, Blue 2, Green 2, Red 2, Black 1. Noble N9 requires 3 Green, 3 Blue, and 3 Red. I need +1 Green, +1 Blue, and +1 Red.

I can purchase L2_61 from the board. It costs 4 White, 2 Blue, and 1 Black. My bonuses reduce this to a net cost of just 2 White tokens. I have exactly 2 White tokens. Buying L2_61 gives me 2 prestige points (increasing my score to 10) and a Green bonus (increasing my Green bonus to 3).

After this purchase, I will have 3 Green, 2 Blue, and 2 Red. I will then be one Blue and one Red bonus away from triggering Noble N9. There are free cards on the board (L1_13 and L1_34) that can provide these bonuses in subsequent turns (L1_13 gives Blue for 1 Black token, L1_34 gives Red for free). Once I acquire those, Noble N9 will visit, adding 3 points for a total of 13.

Buying L2_61 now gets points on the board immediately and optimizes my token count.

2026-01-01 14:00:45.144 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Points: 6, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=2}
2026-01-01 14:01:02.804 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We have 6 tokens (WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=0, BLACK=3) and discounts WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 1. The board provides abundant WHITE, RED, and GOLD tokens but no BLUE or GREEN. Looking at all face‑up cards:
- L1_13 costs 1 BLACK after discounts – 0 prestige.
- L1_34 is free but gives 0 prestige.
- L1_24 costs 1 GREEN after discounts – 1 prestige point.
- L2_50 costs 3 BLACK after discounts – 2 prestige points and a BLUE bonus gem.
- L2_68, L2_69, L3_88, L3_78, L3_86, L3_75 all require more of a color than we can afford.
- L2_54 needs RED and BLUE tokens we do not have.

Thus the highest‑value immediate prestige gain we can afford is the Level‑2 card L2_50, which costs exactly the 3 BLACK tokens we hold after discounts. Purchasing it yields 2 prestige points, raises our BLUE discount from 2 to 3 (future engine growth), and does not require any token returns – we will finish the turn with 3 tokens remaining, well below the 10‑token limit. No reservation or token draw is needed, and the card is not reserved by the opponent. Therefore the optimal action is to purchase L2_50.

Action chosen: PURCHASE_CARD L2_50.

2026-01-01 14:01:30.405 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current token hand is 0 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED, 0 BLACK. Discounts are WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. The board supplies WHITE 4, RED 3, BLACK 1, GOLD 5 but no BLUE or GREEN tokens, so the only legal token‑taking patterns would involve WHITE, RED, or BLACK. However we can also purchase a card directly without taking tokens. Among the visible cards we can afford, L1_13 and L1_34 are free but give no prestige. L1_24 costs 1 GREEN and yields 1 prestige plus a WHITE bonus, while L2_54 costs exactly 1 BLUE and 1 RED (which we have) and yields 1 prestige plus a WHITE bonus gem that raises our WHITE discount from 2 to 3, significantly reducing the cost of many future Level‑2 and Level‑3 cards. Purchasing L2_54 therefore gives an immediate prestige point, strengthens our engine, uses only the tokens we already hold, and does not require any token taking or returns. It also prevents the opponent from possibly snatching a high‑value card on the next turn. Hence the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD L2_54.

2026-01-01 14:02:24.048 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: The board provides only WHITE, RED, and BLACK tokens; we hold blue=3, green=2, red=1 (total 6 tokens). Our discounts are WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. The only face‑up card we can afford directly is L1_24, which costs 4 GREEN. With a GREEN discount of 3 the effective cost is 1 GREEN, which we can pay from our 2 GREEN tokens. Purchasing L1_24 yields an immediate 1 prestige point, raises our score from 6 to 7, and gives a WHITE bonus gem that will increase our WHITE discount, further easing future purchases. No other visible card can be bought without first taking additional tokens, and taking tokens alone would not grant any prestige this turn while leaving us still behind the opponent who has 10 points. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L1_24 now, using 1 GREEN token and gaining both a point and a useful bonus gem.

2026-01-01 14:07:59.163 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I have 12 points and need to reach 15. My bonuses are White 2, Blue 3, Green 3, Red 2, Black 1. Noble N9 is available and requires 3 Green, 3 Blue, and 3 Red. I currently have 3 Green, 3 Blue, and 2 Red, so I need 1 more Red bonus to trigger the noble and win. Card L1_34 is available on the board and provides a Red bonus. Its cost is 2 White, 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Black. My bonuses completely cover this cost (2 White covers 2 White, 3 Blue covers 1 Blue, 3 Green covers 1 Green, 1 Black covers 1 Black), so the net cost is 0 tokens. I can purchase L1_34 immediately for free. This increases my Red bonus to 3, triggering Noble N9 for 3 points. My total score becomes 12 + 0 + 3 = 15, securing the win.

2026-01-01 14:08:27.834 [main] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: We need to increase our prestige points as quickly as possible. The highest‑value card we can eventually afford is L3_88 (LEVEL_3, id L3_88), which is worth 4 prestige points and also gives a RED bonus gem that will raise our RED discount. Its effective cost after discounts is 3 GREEN tokens (7‑4). We currently hold 2 GREEN tokens, so we need exactly one more GREEN token. The only way to gain a single GREEN token in one turn is to take three different‑color tokens that include GREEN. Taking WHITE, GREEN and RED satisfies the rule (3 different colors, each supply >0) and adds one GREEN token, bringing our GREEN count to 3, which is enough to purchase L3_88 on the next turn. After the take our total token count would be 7 (well under the 10‑token limit), so no returns are required. This move gives us the most prestige points in the near future and also improves our discounts for later turns, making it the optimal action this turn.
