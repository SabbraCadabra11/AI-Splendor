Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: On the first turn, I need to start building my engine efficiently. L1_5 provides a BLACK bonus, which is crucial for multiple nobles (N10, N5, N6) and has a low cost (2 GREEN, 1 RED). By reserving it now, I secure the card and gain a gold token, which can substitute for any color, accelerating my ability to purchase it soon. This prevents the opponent from taking L1_5 and gives me flexibility. Alternative token-taking strategies risk the opponent reserving or purchasing L1_5 first, and reserving with gold is more efficient than taking multiple tokens over two turns. I'll aim to take 2 GREEN on my next turn to purchase L1_5 using the gold for RED.

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: We are at the beginning of the game (turn 1) with no tokens and an empty engine. Our goal is to build an efficient path to points. The Level 1 card L1_17 (cost: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 red, 1 black) gives a white bonus, which is valuable for nobles and future cards. We can acquire it in two turns: first, take blue, green, and red tokens (3 different colors) to have one of each. Next turn, take black, white, and blue tokens (again 3 different), giving us the tokens needed for L1_17. After purchasing L1_17, we will have a white bonus and likely a white token, which can be used with a blue token to buy L1_29 (cost: 2 white, 1 blue) using the white bonus to reduce the cost. This plan builds two bonuses quickly and positions us for nobles requiring white and blue. We avoid reserving or taking 2 tokens of one color to maximize token variety and flexibility. The opponent has reserved L1_5 (green/red cost) and may take green/red tokens, but we only need one green and one red, which we are taking now, so conflict is minimal.

======================================================================================

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GLD=1}
Reasoning: On the previous turn, I reserved L1_5 (BLACK bonus, cost 2 GREEN, 1 RED) and gained a gold token. My plan was to take 2 GREEN tokens to purchase L1_5 using the gold for RED. However, my current token count: GOLD=1, others=0. I have 1 token total, so I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. L1_5 cost: 2 GREEN, 1 RED. I have a gold that can substitute for RED. So I need 2 GREEN tokens. But taking only 2 tokens of the same color (GREEN) requires at least 4 GREEN tokens on the board. Board tokens: GREEN=3, not enough for taking 2 of same color. So I cannot take 2 GREEN. Alternative: take 3 different colors including GREEN and maybe others to build towards other cards. My current bonuses: none. Looking at face-up cards: L1_29 (GREEN bonus, cost 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE) is cheap and gives a GREEN bonus which is useful for nobles? Nobles: N10 (BLACK, WHITE, RED), N5 (BLACK, RED), N6 (BLACK, WHITE, BLUE). GREEN is not directly required for nobles, but bonuses help purchase higher cards. L1_17 (WHITE bonus, cost 1 each of BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK) is also cheap but requires diverse tokens. L1_14 (BLUE bonus, cost 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK) and L1_10 (BLUE bonus, cost 1 WHITE,1 GREEN,2 RED,1 BLACK). Since I aim for BLACK bonus for nobles, maybe I should also collect tokens for L1_5 purchase. Since I can't take 2 GREEN, I could take 3 different tokens that include GREEN and others that help. For example, take GREEN, RED, and BLACK? RED is needed for L1_5 but I have gold to substitute, so maybe not urgent. Actually, to purchase L1_5, I need 2 GREEN and 1 RED. With gold substituting for RED, I need 2 GREEN. But I can't take 2 GREEN. So I need to take 1 GREEN now and later another GREEN, or take 3 tokens now and later purchase. I have 1 token total, so I can take 3 tokens without returning. Best to take tokens that advance multiple goals. Consider taking GREEN, RED, and BLACK: GREEN for L1_5, RED for L1_5 (though gold can substitute, but having RED reduces need to use gold), BLACK for future BLACK cards and nobles. Board tokens: GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=4, all available. Taking 1 each is valid. Then next turn, I could take another GREEN (if still available) and purchase L1_5. Alternatively, take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN to diversify. But WHITE and BLUE are needed for nobles and some cards. L1_29 requires WHITE and BLUE. But my immediate goal is L1_5. I think taking GREEN, RED, BLACK aligns with L1_5 and nobles (BLACK and RED for nobles). Also, note that opponent has taken BLUE, GREEN, RED tokens (1 each) last turn? Actually opponent's tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, so they took 3 different tokens. They might be aiming for something. But I should stick to my plan. So I'll take GREEN, RED, BLACK. This gives me tokens: GOLD=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. Next turn, if GREEN is still available, I can take another GREEN (if 4+? Actually to take 2 same color, need 4+ on board. If GREEN is 2 left after I take 1, then board will have 2? Wait, current GREEN=3, I take 1, board becomes 2, so not enough for taking 2 same. So next turn I might need to take 3 different again or purchase L1_5 with my current tokens? After this turn, I'll have 1 GOLD, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK. To purchase L1_5, I need 2 GREEN and 1 RED. I have 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and gold can substitute for 1 RED or 1 GREEN. So I could use gold as the second GREEN? Actually cost: 2 GREEN, 1 RED. I have 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 gold. Gold can substitute for 1 GREEN, so I would have 2 GREEN (1 real + 1 gold) and 1 RED. That works! So after this turn, I can purchase L1_5 immediately next turn! That's great. But wait, I need to ensure I have enough tokens to cover: using gold as a GREEN, I need to pay 2 GREEN and 1 RED. I have 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and gold. So I can pay: 1 GREEN (real), 1 gold (as GREEN), and 1 RED (real). That's exactly the cost. So I can purchase L1_5 next turn. So this turn, I should take tokens that don't interfere with that. Actually, if I take GREEN, RED, BLACK, that gives me exactly what I need. Then next turn, I purchase L1_5. That's perfect. So action: take_ GREEN=1, take_RED=1, take_BLACK=1. All are available on board. No return needed because I will have 1 (current) + 3 = 4 tokens total. So action_type: TAKE_TOKENS.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L1_17 immediately using my current tokens: green, red, black, and gold (as blue). This gives me a white bonus, which is essential for my strategy and nobles. Buying now saves a turn and builds my engine efficiently, allowing me to focus on acquiring tokens for future cards like L1_29.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_17]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_17
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens since I need a BLACK token for L1_17 (cost: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1). Therefore, I should take more tokens. I need a BLACK token specifically, and taking three different colors is allowed. I choose to take BLACK, WHITE, and BLUE tokens because: 1) BLACK is essential for L1_17. 2) WHITE is needed for L1_29 (cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:1) which I plan to purchase after L1_17. 3) BLUE helps with L1_29 and other future cards. Taking these three colors gives me tokens: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, WHITE:1, BLACK:1 (total 6 tokens, under limit). This sets up purchasing L1_17 in the next turn and then L1_29 shortly after. Reserving is less efficient since I can secure L1_17 soon without using a gold token.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Last turn I planned to purchase L1_5 this turn. I currently have tokens: GOLD=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. L1_5 cost: 2 GREEN, 1 RED. I can pay using: 1 GREEN (real), 1 GOLD (substitute for GREEN), and 1 RED (real). That exactly covers the cost. Purchasing now gives me my first BLACK bonus, which is crucial for nobles N10, N5, N6. It also frees up my reserved slot and gives me a point (0 prestige but still progress). I have 4 tokens total, so after paying, I'll have 2 tokens left (BLACK=1, and GOLD used). That's efficient and avoids returning tokens. Alternative actions: Taking tokens would be wasteful since I can already purchase. Reserving another card is possible but not urgent; I should strengthen my engine first. Purchasing L1_5 now is the best move.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I can immediately purchase the Level 1 card L1_17, which costs BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. This aligns with my previous plan to build a white bonus. After purchase, I will have tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:1, and a white bonus, setting me up to pursue L1_29 (cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:1) in the next turns. Purchasing now avoids unnecessary token taking or reserving, and advances my engine efficiently.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLK=2}
Reasoning: I already purchased L1_5 last turn, as per my previous reasoning. Checking the current game state, my purchasedCards includes L1_5, and I have no reserved cards. My tokens are: GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:0. So I already executed the purchase. Now it's a new turn (turn 4). I need to decide my next move. My current status: tokens: BLACK=1 (only one token total), bonuses: BLACK=1, score:0. Available nobles require BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE. I have a BLACK bonus, which helps towards nobles N10 (BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3), N5 (BLACK4, RED4), N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3). My immediate goal is to accumulate more bonuses, especially WHITE and RED, to attract nobles. I should also aim for some prestige points soon. Face-up cards: L1_14 (BLUE bonus, cost 2GREEN,2BLACK), L1_10 (BLUE bonus, cost 1WHITE,1GREEN,2RED,1BLACK), L1_29 (GREEN bonus, cost 2WHITE,1BLUE), L1_33 (RED bonus, cost 1 each of WHITE,BLUE,GREEN,BLACK). Among these, L1_33 gives RED bonus, which is useful for nobles N10 and N5. Its cost is 1 each of four colors (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, BLACK). I currently have BLACK=1 token, and 0 others. I have a BLACK bonus of 1, which reduces the cost of BLACK by 1. So to purchase L1_33, I would need: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (cost) minus my BLACK bonus: BLACK becomes 0 needed. So I need WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1. I have no tokens of those colors. So I need to collect tokens. Alternatively, L1_29 (GREEN bonus) costs 2WHITE,1BLUE. Not directly helpful for nobles, but green bonus is less critical. L1_14 (BLUE bonus) costs 2GREEN,2BLACK; with my BLACK bonus, need 2GREEN,1BLACK. I have 1 BLACK token, so need 2GREEN, and maybe use gold? But no gold. L1_10 (BLUE bonus) costs 1WHITE,1GREEN,2RED,1BLACK; with BLACK bonus, need 1WHITE,1GREEN,2RED. That's more diverse. Considering nobles, RED and WHITE are key. So L1_33 (RED bonus) is attractive. I could aim to collect WHITE, BLUE, GREEN tokens. But I have only 1 token total, so I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=4, RED=4, BLACK=3. So I could take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN (1 each) to directly get the tokens needed for L1_33 (after considering bonus). That would set me up to purchase L1_33 next turn. Alternatively, I could take 2 tokens of same color if available. For WHITE, 3 on board, so can take 2? Rule: need at least 4 tokens on board to take 2 of same color. WHITE=3, so cannot. Same for others except maybe GREEN=4, yes GREEN has 4, so I could take 2 GREEN tokens. But taking 2 GREEN helps with L1_14 or L1_10, not directly with nobles. I think it's better to diversify towards L1_33. Also, opponent has WHITE bonus and tokens WHITE=1, BLUE=1. They might aim for WHITE-related cards. I should maybe take WHITE and BLUE to slow them down. Taking WHITE, BLUE, GREEN is a solid move. That gives me tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 plus existing BLACK=1, total 4 tokens. Then next turn I can purchase L1_33 using those tokens and my BLACK bonus. That would give me a RED bonus, moving towards nobles. Another option: reserve a card. But reserving costs a turn and gives a gold, which might be useful if I need flexibility. However, I currently have no gold and only 1 token, so reserving could be good to get a gold and secure a key card. Which card to reserve? Looking at higher level cards: L2_70 (RED bonus, 3 prestige, cost 6 RED) is expensive but gives points and RED bonus. L2_58 (WHITE bonus, 3 prestige, cost 6 WHITE). L2_51 (BLUE bonus, 2 prestige, cost 5 BLUE). L2_61 (GREEN bonus, 2 prestige, cost 4WHITE,2BLUE,1BLACK). None are immediately affordable. Reserving a level 2 card now might be premature, as I need more bonuses first. Reserving a level 1 card like L1_33 might be unnecessary since it's cheap and I can likely purchase it soon. But if opponent might take it, reserving could be defensive. However, opponent's bonuses: WHITE=1, they might not target RED bonus. I think taking tokens to purchase L1_33 is more efficient. So I'll take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN. That is a valid TAKE_TOKENS action. No return needed. So action_type: TAKE_TOKENS, take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_GREEN=1.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_5]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card L1_5 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: Re-analyzing the game state: I am player 0. My tokens: BLACK=1, GOLD=0? Wait, the state shows my tokens: GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=1, GOLD=0. That means I have only 1 BLACK token. I previously had GOLD=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, but the current state shows otherwise. Looking at my purchasedCards: I have purchased L1_5 (BLACK bonus). That must have happened on the previous turn? The error message said my previous action was invalid because card L1_5 not found on board or in reserved hand. That suggests I tried to purchase L1_5, but it wasn't available. However, the game state now shows I have purchased L1_5, meaning the purchase succeeded? But the error says invalid. Possibly the game engine rejected my purchase attempt because L1_5 was not available, but then the state shows I have it. This is confusing. Let's read my reasoning history: My previous reasoning (turn 3) was about purchasing L1_5. But the error indicates that action was invalid. Yet the current state shows L1_5 in my purchasedCards. That suggests that after the invalid action, the game may have processed a valid action? Or perhaps the error is from a different action. I need to check the turn number: turnNumber=4. That means we are on turn 4, and I am the current player. My previous action (turn 3) must have been invalid, but the state may have been updated? Actually, the state shows I have purchased L1_5, which means I did purchase it at some point. Maybe the error is from an earlier action? No, the error is from my previous action. The game engine says: "Invalid action: Card L1_5 not found on board or in reserved hand." That implies I tried to purchase L1_5 but it wasn't available. However, the state shows L1_5 in my purchasedCards, meaning I must have purchased it earlier. But my reasoning history shows I reserved L1_5 on turn 1, then on turn 2 I took tokens, and on turn 3 I tried to purchase. The state shows I have no reserved cards, and L1_5 is purchased. So likely, my purchase on turn 3 succeeded despite the error? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the error is from a different action and I'm misreading. Let's examine the state carefully: My tokens: only BLACK=1. That suggests I spent my other tokens to purchase L1_5. Indeed, L1_5 cost: 2 GREEN, 1 RED. I would have used my GREEN, RED, and maybe gold? But I have no gold. So I must have used 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK? No, cost doesn't require BLACK. Perhaps I used my gold as a substitute and it got consumed. Gold token count on board is 5, which is high, suggesting no gold has been taken. Wait, board availableTokens: GOLD=5. That's full, meaning no gold tokens have been taken by anyone. So I never had a gold token. That contradicts my earlier reasoning where I said I reserved L1_5 and gained a gold token. But reserving a card gives a gold token only if available. The board had GOLD=5, so it was available. So I should have gotten a gold. But my tokens show GOLD=0. That means I didn't get a gold? Maybe I reserved without taking gold? No, reserving always gives a gold if available. Unless I reserved from the deck (blind draw), which also gives a gold. But I reserved a face-up card, so I should have gotten gold. Hmm. Possibly the game state doesn't show gold in my tokens because it was used to purchase L1_5? But then board gold would be 4 if I took one. It's 5. So I never took gold. That means my reservation on turn 1 didn't give me gold? That seems like a bug, but I must work with the given state. So current reality: I have purchased L1_5, have 1 BLACK token, and no other tokens. My bonuses: BLACK=1. I have no reserved cards. It's my turn (turn 4). I need to decide next move. I have 1 token total, so I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I should aim to build towards nobles or next card. Nobles: N10 requires BLACK, WHITE, RED each 3. N5 requires BLACK4, RED4. N6 requires BLACK, WHITE, BLUE each 3. I already have BLACK=1 bonus. So I need more BLACK, plus WHITE and RED for N10, or RED for N5, or WHITE and BLUE for N6. Looking at face-up cards: L1_14 (BLUE bonus, cost 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK). I have BLACK bonus, but need GREEN and BLACK tokens. L1_10 (BLUE bonus, cost 1 WHITE,1 GREEN,2 RED,1 BLACK). L1_29 (GREEN bonus, cost 2 WHITE,1 BLUE). L1_33 (RED bonus, cost 1 each of WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, BLACK). I have BLACK bonus, so L1_33 could be cheap: I need WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, BLACK tokens. But it gives RED bonus, which is useful for nobles. Also, there are level 2 and 3 cards. I should probably aim for a card that gives WHITE or RED bonus to help with nobles. L1_33 gives RED bonus, and its cost is diverse. I could take tokens towards that. Alternatively, I could reserve a card. But I have no reserved cards, so reserving is safe. However, I should first collect tokens to purchase something. Since I have only 1 token, taking 3 different tokens is good. Which colors? WHITE, BLUE, and RED are useful for nobles and many cards. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, RED=4. All available. Taking WHITE, BLUE, RED gives me tokens in colors I need for nobles and for cards like L1_33. That seems solid. After taking, I'll have BLACK=1, WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1 total 4 tokens. Then next turn I could take more or purchase if possible. L1_33 cost: 1 WHITE,1 BLUE,1 GREEN,1 BLACK. I would have WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, but need GREEN. I could take GREEN next turn or use a gold? No gold. So maybe take GREEN now instead of one of them? But taking GREEN, WHITE, BLUE also works. However, RED is crucial for nobles. I think taking WHITE, BLUE, RED is better because it directly contributes to N10 (WHITE, RED) and N6 (WHITE, BLUE). GREEN is less urgent. So I'll take WHITE, BLUE, RED. Ensure I set the take fields correctly: take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1. Others 0. No return needed. Action_type: TAKE_TOKENS.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:1, and a white bonus from L1_17. I can immediately purchase L1_29 because with my white bonus, the cost of WHITE:2, BLUE:1 is reduced to effectively WHITE:1 and BLUE:1, which matches my current token holdings. Purchasing L1_29 gives me a green bonus, building my engine efficiently without taking tokens or reserving. This move aligns with my strategy to accumulate bonuses and set up for future level 2 or 3 cards, such as L1_33 or L2_61, while minimizing token congestion. Alternative actions like taking tokens or reserving are less optimal since I can advance directly now.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 4 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1). I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10. Need to build towards nobles: N10 (BLACK, WHITE, RED each 3), N5 (BLACK4, RED4), N6 (BLACK, WHITE, BLUE each 3). Currently have BLACK bonus 1. Considering face-up cards: L1_33 (RED bonus, cost 1 each of WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, BLACK) is affordable soon, gives RED bonus useful for nobles. I lack GREEN token. Taking WHITE, BLUE, GREEN would give me GREEN for L1_33 and WHITE/BLUE for nobles. But RED is also crucial for nobles. However, I already have RED=1 token. Taking GREEN now will let me purchase L1_33 next turn if I also get a GREEN token? Actually L1_33 requires 1 GREEN, and I have 0 GREEN. If I take GREEN now, I'll have GREEN=1, plus WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, RED tokens. That's exactly the cost for L1_33 (1 each). So I can purchase L1_33 next turn. That gives me RED bonus, advancing towards N10 and N5. Alternatively, taking WHITE, BLUE, RED duplicates RED but doesn't give GREEN. I'd still need GREEN for L1_33. So taking GREEN is better. Check board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=4, all available. So take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN. This gives me tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 total 7, under 10. Next turn, I can purchase L1_33 using 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK (I have all). That will consume those tokens and give me RED bonus. That's efficient. Also, note opponent has WHITE and GREEN bonuses, so they might compete for nobles requiring those colors. I should focus on BLACK and RED bonuses. L1_33 gives RED bonus. Good. So action: take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_GREEN=1. No returns needed.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens left, so I must take tokens this turn. I have bonuses in WHITE and GREEN from previously purchased cards L1_17 and L1_29, which reduce costs for cards requiring those colors. My immediate goal is to purchase L1_33 from Level 1, which costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1. With my bonuses, I only need to pay BLUE:1 and BLACK:1 tokens, as WHITE and GREEN costs are covered. To obtain these tokens, I need to take one BLUE and one BLACK token this turn. Since I can take exactly three different colors, I also take one RED token, as it will be useful after acquiring the RED bonus from L1_33, and for future cards like L1_10. Taking BLUE, BLACK, and RED ensures I can purchase L1_33 next turn, advancing my engine efficiently. I have 0 tokens currently, so after taking three tokens, I will have 3 tokens, which is under the 10-token limit, so no tokens need to be returned. This action sets me up to gain a RED bonus and build towards nobles requiring multiple colors.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can afford L1_33 exactly with my current tokens and bonuses. Its cost is 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK. My BLACK bonus of 1 reduces the BLACK cost to 0, so I only need to pay 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 GREEN tokens, which I have. Purchasing L1_33 gives me a RED bonus, which is crucial for nobles N10 and N5, and it consumes tokens productively, reducing my token count from 7 to 4, allowing future token grabs. It also denies the opponent potential access to a useful RED bonus card. Alternatives like taking tokens would waste efficiency, and reserving is unnecessary since I can buy now. This move advances my engine toward noble goals efficiently.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1. I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens because even with my bonuses (WHITE:1, GREEN:1), the available cards require tokens I don't have. For example, L1_10 requires RED:2 and BLACK:1 with my bonuses, but I have only RED:1 and BLACK:1. Similarly, L1_14 requires GREEN:1 and BLACK:2, but I have no GREEN tokens. Therefore, I must take tokens this turn. My immediate goal is to purchase L1_10 on my next turn, which gives a BLUE bonus and sets me up for future cards. To purchase L1_10, I need one more RED token (since I have RED:1 and need RED:2). I also take one BLACK token because I plan to eventually purchase L1_32 (1 point, GREEN bonus) which requires BLACK:4, and I currently have only one BLACK. Additionally, I take one BLUE token to build my BLUE resources for Level 2 cards like L2_61 (2 points, GREEN bonus) which requires BLUE:2. After taking these three tokens, I will have BLUE:2, RED:2, and BLACK:2, allowing me to purchase L1_10 next turn by spending RED:2 and BLACK:1. This action efficiently advances my engine while avoiding token waste, as I have only 3 tokens now and will have 6 after taking, under the limit of 10.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 5 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, GREEN=0) and bonuses in BLACK and RED. My goal is to attract nobles N10, N5, or N6, which require additional bonuses in WHITE, BLUE, and more BLACK/RED. I cannot purchase any face-up card immediately, so taking tokens is necessary. The most efficient purchase I can set up is L1_10 (BLUE bonus), which after bonuses costs 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. I already have WHITE and RED tokens, so I only need 1 GREEN. By taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN now, I gain the required GREEN and also diversify my tokens for future purchases (BLUE tokens help toward N6 and BLUE bonus cards). This puts me at 8 tokens total, well under the limit, and allows me to purchase L1_10 next turn, gaining a BLUE bonus and progressing toward noble goals. The board has sufficient tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=1, GREEN=4. This action is valid and efficient.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can purchase L1_10 immediately with my current tokens and bonuses. My WHITE and GREEN bonuses reduce the cost, so I only need to pay RED:2 and BLACK:1, which I have (RED:2, BLACK:2). This gives me a BLUE bonus, which will be useful for future Level 2 cards like L2_61 that require BLUE tokens. Purchasing now is efficient as it advances my engine without needing to take tokens or reserve, and I avoid potential token congestion. Other actions like taking tokens are less optimal since I can directly gain a bonus and prepare for higher-value cards.

======================================================================================

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 7 tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. I need to check if I can purchase any card. My bonuses: BLACK=1, RED=1. Looking at face-up cards:
- L1_14 (BLUE bonus): cost 2 GREEN, 2 BLACK. After bonuses: BLACK reduced by 1, so cost is 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK. I have 1 GREEN token, 1 BLACK token. I would need 1 more GREEN token and possibly use gold? No gold. Not affordable.
- L1_32 (GREEN bonus): cost 4 BLACK. After BLACK bonus, cost is 3 BLACK. I have 1 BLACK token, but I can use other tokens as substitutes? No, I need exactly BLACK tokens or gold. I have no gold. However, I can use any tokens to pay because gold is not required? Wait, the cost is in BLACK only. You must pay with BLACK tokens or gold tokens. I have 1 BLACK token, need 2 more. I have other tokens but they cannot substitute unless I have gold. So not affordable.
- L1_39 (RED bonus): cost 3 WHITE. After bonuses, no reduction. I have 2 WHITE tokens, need 1 more. Not affordable.
- L1_12 (BLUE bonus): cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses: RED reduced by 1, so cost is BLUE1, GREEN3. I have BLUE2, GREEN1. Need 2 more GREEN. Not affordable.
Level 2 cards are too expensive.
But wait, I have 7 tokens, I could take tokens, but that would bring me to 10, which is okay but not optimal. I should consider reserving a card to get a gold token and plan for future. However, I already have two bonuses (BLACK and RED) and need to build towards nobles. Nobles N10 requires BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3. I have BLACK1, RED1, WHITE0 bonuses. I need more BLACK and RED bonuses, and WHITE bonuses. L1_32 gives GREEN bonus, not directly helpful. L1_39 gives RED bonus, but costs 3 WHITE tokens. I could take WHITE tokens next turn and buy it. But I currently have 2 WHITE tokens, need 1 more. Could take 2 WHITE tokens (if available) but board WHITE=2, so I could take 2 WHITE? But rule: can take 2 of same only if 4+ available. WHITE has 2, so cannot take 2. I could take WHITE and another color. That would get me to 9 tokens, then next turn buy L1_39. But then I would have 6 tokens after purchase, okay. Alternatively, I could reserve L1_39 to guarantee it and get a gold token. That might be good because it denies opponent a RED bonus and gives me gold. But reserving uses a turn without immediate benefit. I think taking tokens to eventually buy L1_39 is better. But I need to check if opponent is close to nobles. Opponent has WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1 bonuses. They might be aiming for N6 (BLACK, WHITE, BLUE) or N10. They have no BLACK or RED bonuses yet. So I have advantage in BLACK and RED. I should focus on getting WHITE bonuses. L1_39 gives RED bonus, which I already have, but more RED bonuses help for N5 (BLACK4,RED4). Actually N5 requires 4 RED bonuses. I have 1, so need 3 more. L1_39 gives 1, so that's good. But it costs 3 WHITE tokens, which are also needed for N10 and N6. So buying L1_39 helps both RED and WHITE token accumulation? No, it costs WHITE tokens, not gives WHITE bonus. It gives RED bonus. So it helps for RED but consumes WHITE tokens. That's okay because I have WHITE tokens. I think I should aim to purchase L1_39 soon. To do that, I need 1 more WHITE token. I could take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN? That would give me WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1 total 10 tokens. Then next turn I can buy L1_39 using 3 WHITE tokens. That works. But I must check board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=3, BLACK=2. BLUE is 0, so I cannot take BLUE. So taking WHITE, BLUE, GREEN is invalid because BLUE is 0. I can take WHITE, GREEN, RED? That would give me WHITE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLUE=2, BLACK=1 total 10. Then I can buy L1_39 using 3 WHITE. That's possible. But I have to consider returning tokens if I exceed 10. Currently 7, taking 3 gives 10, exactly at limit. So no returns needed. But taking WHITE, GREEN, RED: board has WHITE=2, GREEN=3, RED=3. All available. That's valid. Then next turn purchase L1_39. That seems like a two-turn plan. However, I could also consider purchasing L1_32 if I can afford it? Wait, cost 4 BLACK. I have 1 BLACK token, 1 BLACK bonus. Need 3 BLACK tokens. I have only 1 BLACK token. Not affordable. What about using gold? I have no gold. So not possible.
Alternatively, I could reserve a level 2 card that gives WHITE or BLACK bonus. But reserving blind is risky. I could reserve face-up L2_58 (WHITE bonus, cost 6 WHITE) but that's expensive. L2_61 (GREEN bonus) not helpful.
I think the best immediate move is to take tokens towards L1_39. So take WHITE, GREEN, RED. But I already have RED=1, GREEN=1. Adding more diversifies. However, I need WHITE the most. Since BLUE is 0, I cannot take BLUE. So take WHITE, GREEN, RED. That gives me WHITE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLUE=2, BLACK=1. Then next turn buy L1_39.
But wait, I could also take WHITE, BLACK, RED? Board BLACK=2, available. That gives WHITE=3, BLACK=2, RED=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1. That also works. Which is better? Taking BLACK helps for future BLACK purchases, but I already have BLACK bonus. Taking GREEN helps for potential GREEN cards. I think taking WHITE, BLACK, RED is slightly better because BLACK is needed for nobles and purchases. But GREEN is less urgent. However, taking GREEN might help for L1_12 or L1_14 later. I'll decide based on noble focus: N10 needs BLACK, WHITE, RED. So taking WHITE, BLACK, RED directly supports that. So I'll take those.
But I must check if taking 2 of same color is possible? No, I'm taking 3 different colors.
So action: take_WHITE=1, take_BLACK=1, take_RED=1.
But wait, board RED=3, BLACK=2, WHITE=2. All have at least 1. Valid.
I'll do that.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_32]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_32
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card immediately due to insufficient tokens. L1_14 (BLUE bonus) is a key target for advancing toward noble N6 and strengthening my engine. Taking tokens to buy it next turn risks opponent reserving or purchasing it first. Reserving L1_14 secures the card, gives me a gold token (wildcard), and allows me to purchase it next turn using my current tokens (1 GREEN, 1 BLACK) plus the gold token as a substitute for the second GREEN. This denies the opponent a useful card and efficiently progresses my strategy.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_14, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens (BLUE:2, BLACK:1) and bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1). For example, L2_61 requires effective WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, but I have no WHITE tokens. Other cards like L1_32 require BLACK:4, which I lack. Reserving a card is better than taking tokens since I cannot immediately purchase anything. L2_61 is a high-priority card because it gives 2 prestige points and a GREEN bonus, aligning with my engine. By reserving it, I gain a GOLD token, which can substitute for missing WHITE tokens. With 2 WHITE tokens and the GOLD token, I can purchase L2_61 in future turns, while avoiding opponent competition.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, and 1 GOLD tokens. I have a BLACK bonus of 1 and a RED bonus of 1. I also have L1_14 reserved, which costs 2 GREEN and 2 BLACK. My BLACK bonus reduces the BLACK cost by 1, so I need to pay 1 BLACK token. The total cost I need to cover: 2 GREEN tokens and 1 BLACK token (since one BLACK is covered by bonus). I have 1 GREEN token and 1 GOLD token that can substitute for the second GREEN. I have 1 BLACK token to cover the BLACK cost. Thus, I can afford L1_14 exactly. Purchasing this card will give me a BLUE bonus, which is valuable for nobles N6 (requires BLUE 3) and future purchases. It will also consume tokens, reducing my token count from 8 to 5, allowing for future token grabs. This is efficient progress towards attracting nobles.

Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens and bonuses. Reserving a card is optimal because it allows me to gain a gold token, which will help me purchase L2_61 sooner. By reserving L1_39, I gain a second gold token, and with one white token next turn, I can purchase L2_61. This strategy efficiently progresses towards my goal while denying the opponent potential cards. Taking tokens would not enable any immediate purchases and would delay acquiring L2_61.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I need to assess my current position. I have tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=0, GOLD=0. Bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. Purchased cards: L1_5 (BLACK), L1_33 (RED), L1_14 (BLUE). So I have a good spread of bonuses. Nobles I'm targeting: N10 (BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3), N5 (BLACK4, RED4), N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3). I currently have BLACK=1, RED=1, BLUE=1, WHITE=0. So I need more WHITE, BLUE, BLACK, RED bonuses. I can't purchase any card immediately because I lack the tokens for the face-up cards. Let's check affordable cards: L1_32 (GREEN bonus, cost BLACK4) - I have BLACK bonus 1, so need 3 BLACK tokens, I have 0. L1_12 (BLUE bonus, cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1) - after bonuses: BLUE cost reduced by 1 (I have BLUE=1) to 0, GREEN3 (I have 0 tokens, bonus 0), RED1 (bonus 1 reduces to 0). So I need 3 GREEN tokens, which I don't have. L1_21 (WHITE bonus, cost RED2, BLACK1) - after bonuses: RED2 reduced by 1 to 1, BLACK1 reduced by 1 to 0. So I need 1 RED token, which I have (RED=1). Wait, I have RED token 1, and after reduction, I need to pay 1 RED token. I have exactly 1 RED token. So I can purchase L1_21 now! That gives WHITE bonus, which is crucial for nobles. Let's verify: cost RED2, BLACK1. My RED bonus=1, so RED cost becomes 1. My BLACK bonus=1, so BLACK cost becomes 0. I have RED token=1, so I can pay the 1 RED token. I have 0 BLACK tokens but cost is 0. So yes, I can purchase L1_21. That would give me WHITE bonus, advancing towards N10 and N6. That's a great move. It also consumes my RED token, reducing my token count from 5 to 4, allowing future token grabs. Alternatively, I could take tokens to set up other purchases, but purchasing now is more efficient. Also, note opponent has WHITE bonus already, so getting WHITE bonus helps compete for nobles. Let's confirm L1_21 is still face-up: yes, in LEVEL_1 list. So I should purchase L1_21. That will give me WHITE bonus, making my bonuses: BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, WHITE=1. That's significant progress. I'll then have 4 tokens left: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0. That's under 10, so no issues. Next turn I can take tokens to build towards other cards. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_21.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I can immediately afford L1_21 (WHITE bonus) using my current tokens and bonuses. The card costs RED2 and BLACK1. My RED bonus of 1 reduces the RED cost to 1, and my BLACK bonus of 1 reduces the BLACK cost to 0. Thus, I only need to pay 1 RED token, which I have. Purchasing this card grants me a WHITE bonus, which is crucial for attracting nobles N10 (requires WHITE3, BLACK3, RED3) and N6 (requires WHITE3, BLACK3, BLUE3). It also consumes a token, reducing my total token count from 5 to 4, allowing for future token grabs without risk of exceeding the limit. Alternative actions like taking tokens are less efficient because I can advance my engine now, and reserving is unnecessary since I have no urgent need to secure a card. This move efficiently progresses my strategy toward noble acquisition and eventual victory.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:2, and bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1. I can purchase L2_51 from the board, which costs 5 BLUE. After applying my BLUE bonus, the effective cost is 4 BLUE. I have 2 BLUE tokens and 2 GOLD tokens, which I can use to cover the remaining 2 BLUE cost. This allows me to gain 2 prestige points immediately and increase my BLUE bonus to 2. This is better than taking tokens or reserving cards, as it directly contributes to my goal of reaching 15 points efficiently. Other options, like purchasing L1_26, would give no points, and reserving cards would delay point acquisition. Thus, purchasing L2_51 is the optimal move.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 0 RED, 0 BLACK, 0 GOLD tokens. I have bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. My total tokens = 4. I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I need to gather tokens for future purchases. Looking at face-up cards, I can consider purchasing L1_12 (BLUE bonus) which costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses, I have BLUE bonus 1 reduces BLUE cost to 0, so cost is GREEN3, RED1. I need 3 GREEN and 1 RED tokens. I currently have 0 GREEN and 0 RED. So I need to collect GREEN and RED. Alternatively, L1_36 (RED bonus) costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. After bonuses: WHITE bonus 1 reduces WHITE cost to 0, RED bonus 1 reduces RED cost to 0, BLACK bonus 1 reduces BLACK cost to 2. So cost is BLACK2. I have 0 BLACK tokens. So I need 2 BLACK. Another option is L1_26 (GREEN bonus) costs WHITE1, BLUE1, RED1, BLACK2. After bonuses: WHITE bonus reduces WHITE cost to 0, BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost to 0, RED bonus reduces RED cost to 0, BLACK bonus reduces BLACK cost to 1. So cost is BLACK1. I have 0 BLACK tokens. So I need 1 BLACK. That seems the easiest: I could take 1 BLACK and 2 other colors to get tokens for other purposes. However, I should also consider nobles: N10 requires BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3. I have BLACK1, WHITE1, RED1. So I need 2 more of each. N5 requires BLACK4, RED4. I need 3 more BLACK, 3 more RED. N6 requires BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3. I need 2 more BLACK, 2 more WHITE, 2 more BLUE. So I need to accumulate more bonuses in these colors. Taking tokens now to buy cards that give bonuses is key. The board has available tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=4, RED=4, BLACK=3. I can take 3 different colors. I should prioritize colors that help me buy cards that give bonuses I need. The easiest card to buy next turn is L1_26 (GREEN bonus) because after bonuses it only costs 1 BLACK token. But I have 0 BLACK tokens. So if I take BLACK plus two other colors, I can buy L1_26 next turn. That would give me a GREEN bonus, which isn't directly needed for nobles, but it diversifies and could help with future purchases. Alternatively, I could take RED, GREEN, and BLACK to set up for L1_12 (needs 3 GREEN, 1 RED) but that would take multiple turns. Another consideration: my opponent has 2 points and has purchased a level 2 card. I need to catch up. I should aim for a noble soon. My bonuses are all at 1, so I need to increase them to 3 in key colors. Perhaps I should target cards that give BLACK or RED bonuses because they are needed for multiple nobles. L1_36 gives RED bonus, but requires 2 BLACK tokens after bonuses. I have 0 BLACK. So if I take 2 BLACK tokens now (since there are 3 available, I can take 2 of the same color), I could buy L1_36 next turn. But taking 2 of the same color requires at least 4 tokens of that color on board. BLACK has 3, so I cannot take 2 BLACK. So I must take 3 different colors. I'll take BLACK, RED, and GREEN. That gives me 1 BLACK, 1 RED, 1 GREEN tokens. Then next turn I can buy L1_26 (costs BLACK1 after bonuses) using the BLACK token, gaining a GREEN bonus. That would leave me with 1 RED and 1 GREEN tokens, and my bonuses: WHITE1, BLUE1, RED1, BLACK1, GREEN1. Then I could aim for L1_36 (RED bonus) which would then cost BLACK2 after bonuses (since BLACK bonus 1, RED bonus 1, WHITE bonus 1). I would need to gather 2 BLACK tokens. Alternatively, I could take tokens to buy L1_12 (BLUE bonus) which would require 3 GREEN and 1 RED, which I'd be short on. So the path of buying L1_26 next seems straightforward. But is it the best? Let's evaluate other cards: L1_12 gives BLUE bonus, which helps for N6. L1_36 gives RED bonus, helps for N10 and N5. L1_32 gives GREEN bonus, but costs BLACK4, after BLACK bonus1 becomes BLACK3, which is expensive. Not good now. So between L1_12 and L1_36, L1_36 is cheaper after bonuses (BLACK2 vs GREEN3+RED1). However, to buy L1_36 I need 2 BLACK tokens. I could take BLACK and two other colors now, then next turn take 2 BLACK if available (if the board still has 4+ BLACK). But currently BLACK=3, after I take 1 BLACK, it becomes 2, so next turn I cannot take 2 BLACK unless replenished. So that's risky. Alternatively, I could reserve L1_36 now to secure it, and get a gold token. But I have 0 gold tokens currently, and reserving would give me a gold, which could help. But I already have 4 tokens total, reserving would bring me to 5 tokens, still under 10. However, reserving doesn't advance my board position immediately. Since I can take tokens and possibly buy something next turn, I prefer to take tokens. I think taking BLACK, RED, GREEN is a solid move. It gives me tokens in colors I need for future purchases, and sets up L1_26 for next turn. After buying L1_26, I'll have GREEN bonus, which might help with L1_32 or other green cards, but not directly for nobles. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK to increase my WHITE and BLUE tokens for future purchases, but I already have 2 WHITE and 2 BLUE tokens, so not urgent. I need BLACK and RED more. So I'll take BLACK, RED, GREEN. This is valid because board has BLACK=3, RED=4, GREEN=4. My total tokens after taking: 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK = 7 tokens. Well under 10. No need to return. Action: take_BLACK=1, take_RED=1, take_GREEN=1.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with no tokens except BLACK:1. I cannot purchase any card from the board or my reserved cards with my current tokens and bonuses. For example, L2_61 requires WHITE:3, but I have no WHITE tokens. Similarly, L1_39 requires WHITE:2, which I lack. Other point cards like L2_52 require BLUE:4 after bonuses, but I have no BLUE tokens. Therefore, I must either take tokens or reserve a card. Taking tokens would allow me to build resources, but reserving a card gives me a gold token immediately, which can substitute for any color and reduce the number of tokens needed for future purchases. Since I have already reserved L2_61 and L1_39, reserving another card will give me a third gold token if needed, but I can only have three reserved cards. However, reserving now will provide a gold token that can be used to purchase L2_61 or L2_52 sooner. L2_52 is a high-value card with 3 points and a BLUE bonus, which synergizes with my existing BLUE bonus from L2_51. By reserving L2_52, I deny it from my opponent and set myself up to purchase it later using tokens and gold. This action is efficient because it progresses my engine without wasting turns on unnecessary token acquisition, and the gold token will help me overcome token shortages in the next turns.

Reasoning: I have 7 tokens and bonuses in WHITE, BLUE, RED, BLACK all at 1. After applying bonuses, L1_26 requires only 1 BLACK token to purchase, which I have. Buying this card gives me a GREEN bonus, diversifying my bonuses and reducing my token count to 6, which allows for future token grabs without risk of exceeding the limit. Other face-up cards are not affordable immediately, and taking tokens would delay progress. This purchase advances my engine efficiently and secures the card before the opponent can take it.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens and bonuses, and I cannot reserve any card because I already have three reserved cards (L2_61, L1_39, L2_52). Therefore, I must take tokens. I need WHITE tokens to purchase L2_61 (which requires effective WHITE:3 after bonuses) and BLUE tokens for L2_52 (effective BLUE:4). Taking one WHITE, one BLUE, and one GREEN token allows me to accumulate these needed resources without exceeding the token limit (current tokens: BLACK:1, GOLD:1; after taking 3, I have 5 tokens). This sets up future turns where I can take additional WHITE tokens to eventually purchase L2_61, my highest-priority card for points and bonuses. GREEN is taken as the third color because it may be useful for nobles or other cards, and it's available on the board.

Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens and bonuses of 1 in each color. L1_6 is immediately affordable after applying bonuses: cost WHITE2, GREEN2 becomes WHITE1, GREEN1. I have 2 WHITE and 1 GREEN tokens, so I can purchase it. This increases my BLACK bonus to 2, which is crucial for attracting nobles N10, N5, and N6. It also consumes tokens, reducing my token count to 4, freeing up capacity for future token grabs. Alternative actions like taking tokens or reserving are less efficient because they delay engine progression. Purchasing L1_6 advances my position and denies the card to the opponent.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1. I have three reserved cards: L2_61, L1_39, and L2_52. I cannot reserve another card because I already have three reserved cards. I cannot purchase any card that gives points immediately: L2_61 requires effective WHITE:3 and BLACK:1, but I only have WHITE:1 and GOLD:1, so I need 2 more WHITE tokens. L2_52 requires effective BLUE:4, but I have only BLUE:1 and GOLD:1, so I need 2 more BLUE tokens. Purchasing L1_39 or L1_1 gives no points and uses tokens that could be used for point cards. Taking tokens now allows me to accumulate the needed WHITE and BLUE tokens to purchase L2_61 in the next turn. I will take one WHITE, one BLUE, and one GREEN token to reach 8 tokens total, setting up for L2_61 purchase next turn. GREEN is chosen as the third color for potential future use with nobles or other cards.

======================================================================================

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 0 BLACK, 0 GOLD tokens. Total tokens = 4. I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. My bonuses are WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I need to gather resources to purchase higher-value cards and work towards nobles. Looking at face-up cards, L1_12 (BLUE bonus) costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After applying bonuses: BLUE bonus 1 reduces BLUE cost to 0, so I need 3 GREEN and 1 RED tokens. I have 0 GREEN and 1 RED, so I need 3 more GREEN. L1_36 (RED bonus) costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. After bonuses: WHITE bonus reduces WHITE cost to 0, RED bonus reduces RED cost to 0, BLACK bonus 2 reduces BLACK cost to 1. So I need 1 BLACK token. I have 0 BLACK, so I need 1 BLACK. L1_1 (BLACK bonus) costs WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. After bonuses: all colors reduced by respective bonuses, so cost becomes 0? Actually, I have bonuses in all colors: WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK2. So the cost would be WHITE0, BLUE0, GREEN0, RED0? Wait, the card gives a BLACK bonus, but I already have BLACK2. The cost is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. After subtracting bonuses, each cost is reduced by 1, so all become 0. That means I can purchase L1_1 for free right now! That would give me an additional BLACK bonus, bringing BLACK to 3, which is crucial for nobles. However, I should verify: my tokens are WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=1. The cost after bonuses is 0, so I don't need to spend any tokens. Yes, I can purchase L1_1 immediately. But wait, the action type would be PURCHASE_CARD with card_id="L1_1". That would give me a BLACK bonus, increase my BLACK bonus to 3, and not consume any tokens. That seems like an excellent move. However, I should consider if there are any other cards I can afford. L1_32 gives GREEN bonus but costs BLACK4, after BLACK bonus 2 becomes BLACK2, which I don't have tokens for. L1_12 requires GREEN3, RED1, which I don't have. L1_36 requires BLACK1 after bonuses, which I don't have. So L1_1 is the only card I can afford right now. Purchasing it gives me a BLACK bonus, which gets me to BLACK3, helping towards nobles N10, N5, and N6. It also doesn't use any tokens, so my token count remains at 4, allowing for future token grabs. However, I should also think about the nobles: N10 requires BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3. I have BLACK3, WHITE1, RED1. So I need 2 more WHITE and 2 more RED. N5 requires BLACK4, RED4. I have BLACK3, RED1, so need 1 more BLACK and 3 more RED. N6 requires BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3. I have BLACK3, WHITE1, BLUE1, so need 2 more WHITE and 2 more BLUE. So increasing BLACK to 3 is a big step. I should purchase L1_1 now. But let me double-check the game state: my purchased cards include L1_5, L1_33, L1_14, L1_21, L1_26, L1_6. L1_1 is not among them. It is face-up. Yes, I can buy it. Alternatively, I could take tokens to set up for other purchases. But buying L1_1 is free and advances my engine. It might be better to take tokens to get BLACK tokens to buy L1_36 next turn, but L1_1 gives a BLACK bonus without spending tokens. Actually, purchasing L1_1 gives me the BLACK bonus and costs nothing, so it's strictly better than taking tokens. However, I need to ensure that purchasing L1_1 is allowed. The card is face-up, and I have sufficient bonuses to cover the cost. The cost is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. My bonuses are each at least 1, so after subtracting, the net cost is 0 for each color. I have enough tokens to cover zero cost. So yes, I can purchase it. I'll do that. But wait, I need to output the action_type as PURCHASE_CARD and card_id as "L1_1". That seems correct. However, let me reconsider if there's any reason to take tokens instead. Taking tokens might allow me to buy a card that gives points sooner, but L1_1 gives no points, only a BLACK bonus. But getting BLACK to 3 is valuable. Also, buying it now might deny it to the opponent, though the opponent has not shown interest. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but I have no reserved cards currently, and reserving might be useful to secure a high-point card. But I think purchasing L1_1 is the most efficient move. Therefore, I will purchase L1_1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I need to collect tokens to afford upcoming purchases. My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I have 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 0 BLACK, 0 GOLD tokens = total 4 tokens. I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I want to target cards that give me BLACK or RED bonuses to attract nobles N10, N5, N6. L1_36 (RED bonus) costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. After bonuses: WHITE bonus reduces WHITE cost to 0, RED bonus reduces RED cost to 0, BLACK bonus 2 reduces BLACK cost to 1. So I need 1 BLACK token to buy L1_36. That's very affordable! But I have 0 BLACK tokens. So I should take BLACK. Also, L1_12 (BLUE bonus) costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost to 0, so cost is GREEN3, RED1. I have 0 GREEN, 1 RED. I need 3 GREEN and 0 RED (since I have 1 RED token, but after RED bonus? Wait: cost RED1, I have RED bonus 1 so reduces to 0, but I still need to pay with tokens if I don't have enough bonuses? Actually, bonuses reduce the cost by that many tokens of that color. So I need to pay 3 GREEN tokens. I have 0 GREEN, so need 3 GREEN. That's more expensive. So L1_36 is cheaper. Also L1_1 (BLACK bonus) costs WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. After bonuses: all colors have at least 1 bonus, so cost becomes 0 across? Actually, each bonus reduces cost of that color by 1. So WHITE cost 1 - 1 = 0, BLUE 1 - 1 = 0, GREEN 1 - 1 = 0, RED 1 - 1 = 0. So L1_1 is FREE! That's huge. It gives a BLACK bonus, increasing my BLACK to 3. That would make me eligible for noble N5 (needs BLACK4, RED4) partially, and N10 (BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3) closer. But I need to check if I have enough tokens to cover any remaining cost? Since all costs are reduced to 0, I can purchase L1_1 immediately with zero tokens. However, I must ensure I have at least 1 token to purchase (the rules allow purchasing with zero tokens if cost is zero? I think yes). But I have 4 tokens, so I can definitely purchase it. However, my previous reasoning error was that I didn't specify token fields for TAKE_TOKENS. Actually, I think I should purchase L1_1 now because it's free and gives a BLACK bonus. But let's double-check: L1_1 is face-up, cost WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1. So each cost reduced by 1, resulting in 0. So I can purchase it without spending any tokens. That would give me a BLACK bonus, increasing BLACK to 3. That's amazing. But wait, I already have BLACK bonus 2, so purchasing L1_1 would make it 3. That's even better. However, I need to consider if there's any rule that says you must spend at least one token? I don't think so. So purchasing L1_1 is the best move because it costs nothing and advances my engine significantly. But my previous action was invalid because I didn't set token fields for TAKE_TOKENS. Actually, the error said "Must select tokens to take." That suggests I attempted TAKE_TOKENS but didn't specify which tokens. So I need to correct that. Given the current state, I should purchase L1_1, not take tokens. But the error indicates I tried TAKE_TOKENS. I need to re-analyze: I think I intended to take tokens, but maybe I should purchase L1_1 instead. However, I must follow my reasoning: I see L1_1 is free, so I should purchase it. That would be action_type PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_1. But the error says my previous action was TAKE_TOKENS and invalid. So I need to provide a valid TAKE_TOKENS action? Actually, the instruction says: "Re-analyze the game state and provide a corrected response." I can choose any valid action. I should choose the best action. Purchasing L1_1 is the best. But I need to ensure I don't make the same mistake: I must set card_id correctly. However, the error was about token selection. I think I should purchase L1_1. But let's consider: if I purchase L1_1, I get a BLACK bonus, making BLACK=3. That would satisfy the BLACK requirement for N10 (BLACK3) and N6 (BLACK3). I still need WHITE3 and RED3 for N10, and WHITE3 and BLUE3 for N6. I have WHITE1, RED1, BLUE1. So I need more bonuses in those colors. My token count would remain 4 (since no tokens spent). Then I can take tokens next turn to buy other cards. Alternatively, I could take tokens now to set up for L1_36, but L1_1 is free and gives a bonus immediately. Free purchase is always good. Also, it denies the card to opponent. So I'll purchase L1_1. But wait, I need to check if L1_1 is still face-up. Yes, it's in LEVEL_1 face-up cards list: L1_1. So it's available. I'll purchase it.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I need to gather tokens to afford future purchases. I have 4 tokens currently (1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED, 0 others). My bonuses are WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I need to increase my BLACK and RED bonuses to attract nobles N10, N5, N6. Looking at affordable cards: L1_36 (RED bonus) costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. After bonuses: WHITE bonus covers WHITE1, RED bonus covers RED1, BLACK bonus reduces BLACK cost to 1 (since BLACK bonus 2 reduces by 2). So effective cost is BLACK1. But I have 0 BLACK tokens. So I need 1 BLACK token to buy it. However, I also need to consider token limits. I have 4 tokens now, I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. Board tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3, GOLD=4. I cannot take BLUE because it's 0. I can take 3 different colors among WHITE, GREEN, RED, BLACK. To set up for L1_36, I need 1 BLACK token. Taking BLACK, RED, and GREEN would give me those tokens. That would bring my tokens to: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. Total 7 tokens. Then next turn I can purchase L1_36 using 1 BLACK token (since cost is BLACK1 after bonuses). That would give me RED bonus, increasing my RED bonus to 2. Alternatively, I could take 2 BLACK tokens if possible? Board has 3 BLACK, so I can take only 1 (since taking 2 requires 4+). So I'll take 1 BLACK, 1 RED, and 1 GREEN. This also sets me up for other cards like L1_12 (needs 3 GREEN, 1 RED) but that's longer term. This move is efficient and does not require returning tokens.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1. My bonuses are WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, and my score is 2. I have three reserved cards: L2_61, L1_39, and L2_52. I cannot reserve another card because I have three reserved. I cannot purchase any card from the board immediately because I lack the necessary tokens, especially RED and BLACK. I can purchase L1_39 from my reserved cards, but it gives 0 points and uses my WHITE tokens, which are needed for L2_61. Purchasing L2_61 requires one more WHITE token (effective cost: WHITE:3, BLACK:1; I have WHITE:2, BLACK:1). Since I cannot purchase L2_61 this turn, taking tokens is the best option. I need one WHITE token to reach the required 3 WHITE for L2_61. Available tokens on the board: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. I must take exactly 3 tokens of different colors since no color has 4+ available for taking 2 of the same. Taking 3 tokens will bring my total to 11, so I must return one token to avoid exceeding 10. I should return a token that I don't need immediately, such as GREEN, as it is not critical for my current plans (L2_61 or L2_52). This action sets up purchasing L2_61 next turn for 2 points, which is more efficient than purchasing L1_39 now.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 7 tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1. My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=2. I can afford L1_36 (RED bonus) which costs WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3. After applying bonuses: WHITE bonus reduces WHITE cost by 1 -> WHITE0, RED bonus reduces RED cost by 1 -> RED0, BLACK bonus reduces BLACK cost by 2 -> BLACK1. So effective cost is 1 BLACK token. I have 1 BLACK token, so I can purchase it immediately. This will increase my RED bonus to 2, which is crucial for attracting nobles N10 (needs RED3) and N5 (needs RED4). It also reduces my token count from 7 to 6, freeing up capacity for future token grabs. Other face-up cards are not affordable immediately: L1_32 costs BLACK4, after BLACK bonus2 becomes BLACK2, but I have only 1 BLACK token and would need more. L1_12 costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1; after bonuses BLUE0, so need GREEN3+RED1, I have only 1 GREEN and 2 RED, insufficient. L1_1 costs WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1; after bonuses all become 0 except possibly GREEN? Actually I have bonuses for all colors, so cost becomes 0, but I need to check: WHITE bonus1 covers WHITE1, BLUE bonus1 covers BLUE1, GREEN bonus1 covers GREEN1, RED bonus1 covers RED1. So L1_1 costs 0 tokens! That means I can purchase it for free, gaining a BLACK bonus and increasing my BLACK bonus to 3. However, L1_1 is a level 1 card with 0 prestige points, but the BLACK bonus is valuable. Purchasing L1_1 would also reduce my token count by 0, so my token count remains 7. That might be less ideal because I want to consume tokens to stay under 10 for future token grabs. But acquiring a third BLACK bonus is significant for nobles: N10 needs BLACK3, N5 needs BLACK4, N6 needs BLACK3. With BLACK3, I am one step closer. However, I also need to consider that buying L1_36 gives me a RED bonus, which I also need. Both are good. But buying L1_1 is free and immediate, while L1_36 costs 1 BLACK token. I should compare the long-term impact. If I buy L1_1, my bonuses become BLACK3, others unchanged. Then I need RED bonuses to reach N10 and N5. If I buy L1_36, my bonuses become RED2, BLACK2. Then I need one more RED and one more BLACK for N10, and two more RED and two more BLACK for N5. But with BLACK already at 2, I can aim for another BLACK card. L1_1 is still on the board, so I could buy it later for free as well. However, buying L1_36 now consumes a token, which is good because I have 7 tokens and might want to take more tokens next turn. If I buy L1_1, I still have 7 tokens, and if I take 3 tokens next turn, I'll be at 10, which is okay but limits further token grabs. I think buying L1_36 is slightly better because it gives me a RED bonus (increasing from 1 to 2) and consumes a token, whereas L1_1 gives a BLACK bonus (increasing from 2 to 3) but doesn't consume tokens. Given that I have plenty of tokens, consuming one is beneficial. Also, L1_36 might be taken by the opponent if I delay. The opponent has 2 points and has reserved cards, but L1_36 is a level 1 card with 0 points, so maybe not a high priority for them. But securing it now advances my engine. I'll purchase L1_36.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1, and bonuses: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1. I have three reserved cards: L2_61, L1_39, and L2_52. I cannot reserve any more cards since I already have three reserved. I can purchase L2_61 from my reserved cards, which costs WHITE:4, BLUE:2, BLACK:1. After applying my bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:3 (since WHITE bonus reduces cost by 1), BLUE:0 (BLUE bonus reduces cost to 0), and BLACK:1. I have exactly WHITE:3 and BLACK:1, so I can purchase it without using gold. This would give me 2 prestige points, increasing my score to 4, and add a GREEN bonus (increasing it to 2). Purchasing a point card now is more efficient than taking tokens or purchasing other cards that give no points, such as L1_39 or board cards like L1_12. I cannot afford L2_52 yet, as I need more BLUE tokens. Purchasing L2_61 advances my goal of reaching 15 points efficiently.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED, 0 BLACK tokens, total 6 tokens. My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. I can purchase L1_1 for free after applying bonuses: cost WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1. My bonuses cover each cost exactly, so effective cost is 0 tokens. This will increase my BLACK bonus from 2 to 3, which is crucial for attracting nobles N10 (needs BLACK3), N5 (needs BLACK4), and N6 (needs BLACK3). Purchasing L1_1 now secures the third BLACK bonus, making me only one BLACK away from N5 and satisfying N10 and N6's BLACK requirement. It also consumes no tokens, but my token count remains 6, which is fine because I can still take up to 4 more tokens without exceeding 10. Alternative actions: taking tokens could set up for other cards, but I need to prioritize bonuses to attract nobles. L1_12 (BLUE bonus) costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1; after bonuses BLUE0, need GREEN3+RED1, I have only 1 GREEN and 2 RED, insufficient. L1_32 (GREEN bonus) costs BLACK4, after BLACK bonus2 becomes BLACK2, I have 0 BLACK tokens, so not affordable. L1_9 (BLUE bonus) costs WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1; after bonuses all become 0 except possibly? I have bonuses for all colors, so cost 0 as well, but it gives BLUE bonus which is less critical than BLACK for nobles. However, L1_9 also gives 0 points. L1_1 gives BLACK bonus which I need more. Also, I should consider that I have 6 tokens, and taking 3 tokens would bring me to 9, which is okay, but then I might not be able to purchase anything immediately next turn if I don't have the right tokens. Better to purchase now to advance my engine and deny the card to opponent. My opponent has 4 points and is ahead, so I need to catch up by attracting nobles. Increasing BLACK to 3 gets me closer to N10 and N6. After purchasing L1_1, my bonuses become BLACK3, and I still need WHITE and RED for N10 (I have WHITE1, RED2, so need 2 more WHITE and 1 more RED). For N6, I need WHITE3 and BLUE3 (I have WHITE1, BLUE1, so need 2 more each). So my next targets should be WHITE and RED bonuses. I can aim to purchase L1_12 later for BLUE bonus, but it requires gathering GREEN and RED tokens. However, I have enough RED tokens already, but need GREEN. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but reserving doesn't give immediate benefit. Given the current state, purchasing L1_1 is the most efficient move to progress towards nobles.

Reasoning: I need to purchase L2_52 to gain 3 points and a BLUE bonus, but I currently lack enough tokens to do so. With my current tokens (BLUE:2, GOLD:1), I need effectively BLUE:4, so I require two more tokens that can substitute for BLUE. Reserving a card gives me a gold token, so after reserving, I will have two gold tokens, allowing me to purchase L2_52 next turn by spending my two BLUE tokens and two gold tokens. Reserving L2_58 is a good choice because it provides 3 points and a WHITE bonus, which synergizes with my existing WHITE bonus and sets me up for future purchases. This action is efficient as it progresses my point acquisition without wasting turns on token accumulation, and it denies a valuable card from my opponent.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_58, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I need to analyze the current state: I have 0 prestige points, opponent has 4. My bonuses: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=0, total 6. Available board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=4, GOLD=3. Face-up cards: L1_32 (GREEN bonus, 1 point, cost BLACK4), L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points, cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1), L1_9 (BLUE bonus, 0 points, cost WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1), L1_19 (WHITE bonus, 0 points, cost BLUE2, GREEN2, BLACK1). Level 2 and 3 cards are too expensive. I need to gain points and attract nobles. Nobles: N10 needs BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3; N5 needs BLACK4, RED4; N6 needs BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3. My bonuses: BLACK=3 (satisfies N10 and N6 for BLACK, N5 needs one more), RED=2 (needs 1 more for N10, 2 more for N5), WHITE=1 (needs 2 more for N10 and N6), BLUE=1 (needs 2 more for N6). So I need WHITE, RED, and BLUE bonuses. Looking at affordable cards: L1_9: cost WHITE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. After applying my bonuses: WHITE bonus covers WHITE1, GREEN bonus covers GREEN1, RED bonus covers RED1, BLACK bonus covers BLACK1. So effective cost is 0 tokens! I can purchase L1_9 for free, gaining a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus to 2. That moves me closer to N6 (needs BLUE3). L1_12: cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus covers BLUE1, so need GREEN3+RED1. I have 1 GREEN token and 2 RED tokens, but I need 3 GREEN tokens total. I have only 1 GREEN token and 0 GREEN bonuses beyond my existing one? Actually I have GREEN bonus=1, but that only reduces the GREEN cost by 1, so I would need to pay 2 GREEN tokens. I have only 1 GREEN token, so insufficient. L1_19: cost BLUE2, GREEN2, BLACK1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE by 1 -> need BLUE1, GREEN bonus reduces GREEN by 1 -> need GREEN1, BLACK bonus reduces BLACK by 3 -> BLACK0. So effective cost: BLUE1, GREEN1. I have 2 BLUE tokens and 1 GREEN token, so I can afford it. That would give WHITE bonus, increasing my WHITE bonus to 2, which is good for nobles. L1_32: cost BLACK4. After BLACK bonus=3, need BLACK1. But I have 0 BLACK tokens, so cannot afford. However, if I take a BLACK token, I could buy it next turn. But L1_32 gives 1 point and GREEN bonus, which I don't desperately need (GREEN is already 1). Comparing L1_9 (free, BLUE bonus) and L1_19 (costs BLUE1, GREEN1, WHITE bonus). Both give 0 points. Which is more valuable? For nobles, I need WHITE and BLUE. WHITE bonus is needed for N10 and N6, BLUE for N6. I currently have WHITE=1, BLUE=1. Increasing either to 2 is good. But L1_9 is free and doesn't consume tokens, while L1_19 consumes tokens, reducing my token count from 6 to 4, which might be good to free up capacity. However, I have 6 tokens, so I can still take up to 4 more without exceeding 10. Consuming tokens now might be beneficial to avoid future token return, but it's not urgent. I should also consider that L1_9 gives BLUE bonus, and I already have a BLUE bonus from purchased cards, but the opponent is focusing on BLUE (they have BLUE=2 and reserved BLUE cards). They might be competing for BLUE bonuses. Getting another BLUE bonus could be strategic. However, L1_19 gives WHITE bonus, which I also need. I need to think about which noble is easier to attract. N10 requires WHITE3, RED3, BLACK3. I have BLACK3, RED2, WHITE1. So I need 2 WHITE and 1 RED. N6 requires WHITE3, BLUE3, BLACK3. I have BLACK3, WHITE1, BLUE1. So I need 2 WHITE and 2 BLUE. So both require WHITE. Getting WHITE bonuses is crucial. L1_19 gives WHITE bonus, L1_9 gives BLUE. But I can potentially get both. However, I should also consider that purchasing L1_9 now is free, leaving my tokens intact to possibly purchase L1_19 next turn if I take tokens. But to buy L1_19, I need BLUE1 and GREEN1. I have 2 BLUE and 1 GREEN, so I can buy it now if I want. But if I buy L1_9 now, I still have 6 tokens, and next turn I could buy L1_19 if I still have the tokens. However, after buying L1_9, my BLUE bonus becomes 2, and then buying L1_19 would cost BLUE1, GREEN1. With BLUE bonus 2, the BLUE cost becomes 0? Wait: L1_19 cost BLUE2, GREEN2, BLACK1. After bonuses: WHITE bonus doesn't apply, BLUE bonus reduces BLUE by 2? Actually my BLUE bonus would be 2 after buying L1_9, so BLUE cost becomes 0 (2-2=0). GREEN bonus reduces GREEN by 1, so need GREEN1. BLACK bonus reduces BLACK by 3, so BLACK0. So effective cost: GREEN1. I have 1 GREEN token, so I could buy L1_19 next turn for just 1 GREEN token. That's efficient. So sequence: buy L1_9 now (free, BLUE+1), then next turn buy L1_19 (cost GREEN1, WHITE+1). That would give me WHITE=2, BLUE=2. Alternatively, buy L1_19 now (cost BLUE1, GREEN1), then next turn buy L1_9 (free). Same outcome but different token consumption. Which order? If I buy L1_19 now, I consume tokens, reducing my token count to 4. That might be good because then I can take 3 tokens next turn without hitting 10. If I buy L1_9 now, I stay at 6 tokens, and then buying L1_19 next turn would reduce to 5. Both are fine. However, I should also consider the opponent's moves. They have 4 points and might be close to a noble or high-point card. I need to gain points soon. Neither L1_9 nor L1_19 give points. But they help attract nobles which give 3 points each. I need to accelerate towards nobles. After acquiring WHITE and BLUE bonuses, I still need more WHITE and BLUE to reach 3 each. I might need to reserve or purchase higher-level cards. But for now, progressing bonuses is key. Another consideration: L1_12 gives BLUE bonus but requires more GREEN tokens. I could aim for that later. But I think the immediate free purchase of L1_9 is attractive because it doesn't consume tokens and advances my BLUE bonus. However, I should also check if there's any card I can purchase that gives points. L1_32 gives 1 point, but I need a BLACK token. I have 0 BLACK tokens, but board has 4 BLACK. I could take a BLACK token now, but I would need to take 3 different colors (since BLUE is 0, I can't take BLUE). Available colors with tokens: WHITE=3, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=4. I could take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. That would give me 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, bringing my tokens to 7. Then next turn I could buy L1_32 using 1 BLACK token (since after BLACK bonus=3, cost BLACK1). That gives 1 point and GREEN bonus. But that delays my bonus progression for nobles. The point is nice, but nobles give 3 points. I think focusing on nobles is better. So I'll go for bonus acquisition. Between L1_9 and L1_19, I'll choose L1_9 because it's free and I can still buy L1_19 next turn. Also, L1_9 might be taken by opponent? They have reserved cards but might take it. Better to secure it now. So I'll purchase L1_9.

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_52 from my reserved cards. With my current tokens (BLUE:2, GOLD:2) and bonuses (BLUE:2), the effective cost for L2_52 is BLUE:4. I have BLUE:2 tokens, so I need 2 more tokens, which I can use my 2 gold tokens to cover. This will give me 3 prestige points and increase my BLUE bonus to 3, bringing my score from 4 to 7. Purchasing this point card now is more efficient than taking tokens or buying low-value cards from the board, as it directly advances my goal of reaching 15 points.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=0) and bonuses (WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3). I need to progress towards nobles: N10 (BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3), N5 (BLACK4, RED4), N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3). My priorities are increasing WHITE and RED bonuses. L1_19 gives a WHITE bonus and costs BLUE2, GREEN2, BLACK1. After applying my bonuses: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost by 2 (I have BLUE=2) -> 0; GREEN bonus reduces GREEN cost by 1 -> need GREEN1; BLACK bonus reduces BLACK cost by 3 -> 0. So effective cost is 1 GREEN token. I have exactly 1 GREEN token, so I can purchase L1_19 immediately. This will increase my WHITE bonus to 2, moving me closer to N10 and N6. It also consumes my GREEN token, reducing my token count from 6 to 5, which is good for future token grabs. Alternative actions: taking tokens could set up for L1_32 (1 point, GREEN bonus) but that requires a BLACK token, and I'd need to take tokens now (e.g., WHITE, GREEN, BLACK) but that would bring me to 9 tokens, and then I could buy L1_32 next turn. However, L1_32 gives a GREEN bonus which is less critical, and only 1 point. The noble strategy yields 3 points per noble, so focusing on WHITE bonus is better. Purchasing L1_19 now is efficient and doesn't require returning tokens. It also denies the card to the opponent, though they have reserved cards and may not target it. My previous reasoning planned to buy L1_9 first, then L1_19; I already bought L1_9, so now buying L1_19 is the logical next step.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 7, and I currently have tokens: GREEN:2, RED:1. My bonuses are WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:2. I have reserved cards L1_39 and L2_58. I can purchase L1_23 from the board because my BLUE bonus of 3 reduces its cost to zero, allowing me to gain a WHITE bonus without spending any tokens. This increases my WHITE bonus to 2, which reduces the effective cost of L2_58 from WHITE:5 to WHITE:4, making it easier to purchase in future turns. Since this action costs nothing and improves my engine, it is efficient for reaching my goal of 15 points. I will save my current tokens for future token accumulation or purchases.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Now that I have purchased L1_19, my bonuses are WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0, total 5. I need to gather tokens to purchase cards that will give me additional WHITE and RED bonuses to attract nobles N10 and N5. Looking at face-up cards: L1_32 (GREEN bonus, 1 point, cost BLACK4) could be purchased if I get 1 BLACK token (since BLACK bonus 3 reduces cost to BLACK1). However, GREEN bonus is not a priority. L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points, cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1) is not affordable because I need 2 more GREEN tokens after applying bonuses? Actually, after bonuses: BLUE bonus 2 covers BLUE1, so need GREEN3+RED1. I have RED tokens but insufficient GREEN. L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point, cost RED4) after RED bonus 2 reduces to RED2. I have 2 RED tokens, so I could purchase L1_16 immediately! That gives 1 point and a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus to 3, which satisfies the BLUE requirement for N6 (needs BLUE3). However, L1_16 costs RED4: after RED bonus 2, I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I have exactly 2 RED tokens, so I can purchase it now. That would give me my first point and increase BLUE bonus to 3. That's excellent progress towards N6. But I should also consider that I currently have 5 tokens, purchasing L1_16 would consume 2 RED tokens, leaving me with 0 RED tokens and total tokens 3. That's low, but I can then take tokens next turn. However, if I purchase L1_16 now, I get a point and a crucial BLUE bonus. Alternatively, I could take tokens to set up for other cards. But taking tokens now would bring me to 8 tokens (if I take 3), and then I might be unable to purchase next turn if I exceed 10. Actually, I have 5 tokens, I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10, so I could take tokens and then purchase next turn. But purchasing L1_16 now gives immediate point and bonus. Also, the opponent is at 7 points, I need to catch up. So purchasing L1_16 seems superior. Wait, I need to verify the cost: L1_16 cost RED4. My RED bonus is 2, so I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I have 2 RED tokens, so yes. I also need to consider that I have no gold tokens to substitute. So I can purchase L1_16. That will increase my BLUE bonus to 3, which combined with BLACK3 and WHITE2, I only need 1 more WHITE bonus to satisfy N6 (requires WHITE3, BLUE3, BLACK3). So after that, I would need one more WHITE bonus to attract N6. That's promising. Therefore, I will purchase L1_16.

Reasoning: I currently have 0 prestige points, opponent has 7. My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0, total 5 tokens. Face-up cards: L1_32 (GREEN bonus, 1 point, cost BLACK4), L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points, cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1), L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point, cost RED4), L1_2 (BLACK bonus, 0 points, cost WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1). I need to progress towards nobles: N10 (BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3), N5 (BLACK4, RED4), N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3). My current bonuses: BLACK=3 satisfies N10 and N6 for BLACK, but N5 needs BLACK4. RED=2 needs 1 more for N10, 2 more for N5. WHITE=2 needs 1 more for N10 and N6. BLUE=2 needs 1 more for N6. So I need to increase WHITE, RED, and BLUE bonuses. I can purchase L1_19 (WHITE bonus) which is in my purchased list? Wait, I already purchased L1_19 according to my purchased cards list. Yes, L1_19 is in my purchased cards. That means I cannot purchase it again. I need to check the current face-up cards again. In the current game state, L1_19 is not listed as face-up; it's already in my purchased cards. So I cannot purchase it. I made a mistake in reasoning. I need to look at what is actually available. Available cards: L1_32, L1_12, L1_16, L1_2. I need to see which of these I can afford and which give useful bonuses. L1_2 gives BLACK bonus, which I already have 3 of, but could help for N5 (needs BLACK4). However, L1_2 cost: WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1. After applying my bonuses: WHITE bonus reduces WHITE cost by 2 -> WHITE0 (since I have WHITE=2), BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost by 2 -> BLUE0, GREEN bonus reduces GREEN cost by 1 -> GREEN0, RED bonus reduces RED cost by 2 -> RED0. So effective cost is 0 tokens! I can purchase L1_2 for free, gaining a BLACK bonus, increasing my BLACK bonus to 4. That would satisfy N5's BLACK requirement (needs BLACK4) and N10 and N6 already satisfied for BLACK. That is a significant step towards N5. N5 also needs RED4, and I have RED=2, so need 2 more RED. But getting BLACK to 4 is great. Also, purchasing L1_2 consumes no tokens, so my token count remains 5. Alternative: L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point, cost RED4. After bonuses: RED bonus reduces RED cost by 2 -> need RED2. I have 2 RED tokens, so I can afford it, spending 2 RED tokens. That would give me 1 point and increase BLUE bonus to 3, satisfying N6's BLUE requirement (needs BLUE3). However, I would need to spend tokens, reducing my token count to 3 (since I spend 2 RED tokens). That gives me a point and progresses towards N6. N6 also needs WHITE3 (I have 2) and BLACK3 (I have 3). So after purchasing L1_16, I would have BLUE=3, WHITE=2, BLACK=3, so need 1 more WHITE for N6. That's also good. Comparing: L1_2 gives BLACK bonus (0 points), L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point. Which is more urgent? I have 0 points, opponent has 7. I need points. L1_16 gives a point, which is valuable. Also, BLUE bonus to 3 satisfies N6's BLUE requirement, leaving only WHITE to get. WHITE I can get from another card. However, purchasing L1_2 gives BLACK to 4, which satisfies N5's BLACK requirement, but N5 also needs RED4, which I'm far from (RED=2). N5 might be harder to achieve than N6. N6 requires WHITE3, BLUE3, BLACK3. After L1_16, I have BLUE=3, BLACK=3, WHITE=2. So need 1 WHITE. I could aim for L1_12 (BLUE bonus) but that doesn't give WHITE. There is L1_? Actually L1_2 gives BLACK, not WHITE. There is no WHITE bonus card currently face-up except maybe higher levels, but they are expensive. I could reserve a WHITE card from deck or take tokens to buy a WHITE card later. However, I also need RED for N10 and N5. This is complex. Let's evaluate the nobles: N10 (BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3): I have BLACK3, WHITE2, RED2 -> need 1 WHITE, 1 RED. N5 (BLACK4, RED4): I have BLACK3, RED2 -> need 1 BLACK, 2 RED. N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3): I have BLACK3, WHITE2, BLUE2 -> need 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE. So all nobles are close. Which is easiest? N10 requires 1 WHITE and 1 RED. N6 requires 1 WHITE and 1 BLUE. N5 requires 1 BLACK and 2 RED. N10 seems easiest because I need only 1 WHITE and 1 RED. I can get WHITE from a card or by increasing bonus, RED from a card. L1_16 gives BLUE bonus, not WHITE or RED. L1_2 gives BLACK, which helps N5 but not N10 or N6 directly. However, having BLACK=4 could allow me to attract N5 if I get RED to 4, but that's two more RED bonuses, which is harder. So focusing on N10 or N6 is better. L1_16 gives a point and BLUE bonus, which gets me closer to N6 (BLUE=3). Then I need WHITE=3. I have WHITE=2, so need one more WHITE bonus. There is no WHITE bonus card face-up currently. I could reserve a WHITE card from deck, or take tokens to eventually buy a WHITE card. But I might also consider L1_12 gives BLUE bonus (0 points), but I already have BLUE=2, and L1_12 costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus covers BLUE1, so need GREEN3+RED1. I have 0 GREEN tokens and 2 RED tokens, but need 3 GREEN tokens. I have GREEN bonus=1, so I need to pay 2 GREEN tokens. I have 0 GREEN tokens, so not affordable now. I would need to collect GREEN tokens. That might take time. L1_32 gives GREEN bonus and 1 point, cost BLACK4. After BLACK bonus=3, need BLACK1. I have 0 BLACK tokens, so not affordable now. I could take a BLACK token now and then buy it next turn. But that gives GREEN bonus, which I don't desperately need. However, it gives a point. Considering my point deficit, I should prioritize gaining points. L1_16 gives 1 point and a useful BLUE bonus. That seems the best. I can afford it with my 2 RED tokens. After purchasing, my token count becomes 3 (WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0). That's low, but I can then take tokens next turn. Also, I will have 1 point, and my BLUE bonus becomes 3, which satisfies N6's BLUE requirement. Then I only need 1 WHITE bonus to attract N6 (since I already have BLACK=3). That's a clear path. Alternatively, I could take tokens now to set up for future purchases. But with 5 tokens, I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. Board tokens: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=4, GOLD=5. I could take, for example, WHITE, BLUE, BLACK (each 1). That would give me tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=1, total 8. Then next turn I could buy L1_16 (cost RED2) or L1_32 (cost BLACK1). But taking tokens delays point acquisition. Given that the opponent is at 7 points, I need to start scoring. I think purchasing L1_16 now is the best move. It gives a point and progresses towards N6. I'll purchase L1_16.

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=1}
Reasoning: I need to purchase L2_58 for 3 points, but I currently lack white tokens. I have 0 white tokens, and the board has 3 white tokens available. Taking one white token along with blue and green tokens allows me to start accumulating white tokens for future purchase of L2_58. Taking three tokens is efficient because I have only 3 tokens currently, and I won't exceed the token limit of 10. Purchasing other cards, such as L1_39 or board cards like L1_12, does not give points and would waste turns. Reserving a card might give a gold token, but it doesn't directly accelerate white token acquisition. Therefore, taking tokens is the most efficient action to progress toward purchasing point cards.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 5 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0) after purchasing L1_19 last turn, but wait I need to re-evaluate because the current game state shows I have GREEN=0 tokens, meaning I must have already purchased L1_19? Actually, looking at my purchased cards list, L1_19 is already there. So I already bought it. My current tokens are WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0. My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. I have 0 prestige points. Opponent has 7 points. I need to gain points quickly. I can afford L1_32 (GREEN bonus, 1 point) cost BLACK4. After my BLACK bonus=3, I need 1 BLACK token. I have 0 BLACK tokens, but board has BLACK=4. I could take tokens to get a BLACK token, but I must take 3 different colors if taking 3 tokens. Available tokens on board: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=4. I can take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (since BLUE only 1, but I can take BLUE as one of the three? Actually BLUE count is 1, which is less than 4 so I cannot take 2 BLUE, but I can take 1 BLUE as part of 3 different colors. I need to choose 3 colors with at least 1 token each. All colors have at least 1 token except maybe? All have at least 1. So I could take BLACK, WHITE, and BLUE, for example. That would give me 1 BLACK, 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE. My token count is currently 5, so adding 3 would make 8, no need to return. Then next turn I could buy L1_32 using 1 BLACK token, gaining 1 point and GREEN bonus. However, I should consider if there's a more efficient move. L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points) cost BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus=2 covers BLUE1, so need GREEN3+RED1. I have 0 GREEN tokens and 2 RED tokens, so I need 3 GREEN tokens total, but I only have 0, and board has 1 GREEN, so I can't afford it now. L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point) cost RED4. After RED bonus=2, need RED2. I have 2 RED tokens, so I can purchase L1_16 immediately! That would give me 1 point and a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus to 3. That is significant because N6 requires BLUE3, and I already have BLACK3 and WHITE2, so I would only need 1 more WHITE to satisfy N6. Also, purchasing L1_16 consumes my RED tokens, reducing my token count from 5 to 3 (since I need to pay RED2). That's good for future token grabs. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_2 (BLACK bonus, 0 points) cost WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1. After bonuses: WHITE bonus=2 covers WHITE1, BLUE bonus=2 covers BLUE2, GREEN bonus=1 covers GREEN1, RED bonus=2 covers RED1, so effective cost 0 tokens. That would increase my BLACK bonus from 3 to 4, which satisfies N5's BLACK requirement and leaves only RED4 needed for N5, and also satisfies N10's BLACK requirement. That's a strong move because it gives me a fourth BLACK bonus for free, and I can then focus on RED bonuses. However, L1_2 gives 0 points. But attracting N5 gives 3 points. I currently have RED=2, so I need 2 more RED bonuses to get to RED4 for N5. I also need 1 more WHITE and 1 more RED for N10. So increasing BLACK to 4 is excellent progress. L1_16 gives 1 point and BLUE bonus, which helps for N6 but not as directly for N5 or N10. Considering the opponent has 7 points, I need to aim for nobles which give 3 points each. N5 requires BLACK4, RED4. If I get BLACK4 now, I only need 2 more RED bonuses. N10 requires BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3. I have BLACK3, WHITE2, RED2, so I need 1 WHITE and 1 RED. So both nobles are within reach. L1_2 gives BLACK bonus, moving me to BLACK4. That makes N5 closer. L1_16 gives BLUE bonus, which helps for N6, but N6 requires WHITE3, BLUE3, BLACK3. I have WHITE2, BLUE2, BLACK3, so I need 1 WHITE and 1 BLUE. So both nobles are similarly close. However, I already have more progress towards N10 and N5 because I have higher RED (2 vs BLUE 2). Actually BLUE is 2 as well. But N10 and N5 share RED requirement, so focusing on RED might be efficient. But getting BLACK4 now is free and doesn't consume tokens, while L1_16 consumes tokens. Also, after purchasing L1_2, I still have 5 tokens, allowing me to take more tokens next turn to possibly buy a RED card. I should check if there are any affordable RED bonus cards. L1_12 gives BLUE, not RED. L1_32 gives GREEN. No RED bonus cards on board currently. The only RED bonus card visible is L2_70 (RED bonus, 3 points) but too expensive. So I might need to reserve a RED card or wait for new flips. However, I can also use tokens to buy cards that give RED bonuses. But I have only 2 RED tokens. I could take tokens to gather RED and WHITE. Actually, after buying L1_2, my bonuses become BLACK=4, others unchanged. Then I could take tokens to set up for a future RED purchase. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token. But reserving doesn't give immediate benefit. I think purchasing L1_2 is the best move because it's free, advances my noble progress significantly, and doesn't consume tokens, keeping my options open. L1_16 gives 1 point, which is nice, but I need 15 points to win, and 1 point is small compared to noble potential. I'll go for the free BLACK bonus.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_19]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card L1_19 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I currently have 0 prestige points, opponent has 7. My bonuses: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=0, total 5. Available board tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=4, GOLD=5. I need to gain points quickly. I can afford L1_32 (cost BLACK4, GREEN bonus, 1 point). After applying BLACK bonus 3, effective cost is BLACK1. I have 0 BLACK tokens, but I can take tokens this turn to set up for purchasing it next turn. However, I should also consider purchasing other cards. L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points) costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE by 2 -> BLUE0, need GREEN3+RED1. I have GREEN=1 bonus, so need GREEN2 tokens and RED1 token. I have 0 GREEN tokens, 2 RED tokens, so I need 2 GREEN tokens. Not affordable now. L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point) costs RED4. After RED bonus 2, need RED2. I have 2 RED tokens, so I can afford it! That would give me 1 point and a BLUE bonus, increasing BLUE to 3. That's attractive because it gives a point and progresses towards N6 (needs BLUE3). However, I need WHITE and BLACK for N6 as well. L1_2 (BLACK bonus, 0 points) costs WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1. After bonuses: WHITE2 covers WHITE1, BLUE2 covers BLUE2, GREEN1 covers GREEN1, RED2 covers RED1, so cost 0 tokens. I can purchase L1_2 for free, gaining a BLACK bonus (increasing BLACK to 4). That would satisfy N5's BLACK requirement and bring me closer to N10 and N6. However, it gives 0 points. I need points. L1_16 gives 1 point and BLUE bonus, which is also valuable. But L1_2 is free and increases BLACK to 4, which is crucial for N5. N5 requires BLACK4 and RED4. I have RED2, so need 2 more RED. If I get BLACK4 now, I only need RED2 more to attract N5. That's 3 points. Alternatively, L1_16 gives 1 point and BLUE bonus, which helps with N6. I need to evaluate which noble is closer. For N5: I need RED2 more (I have RED2 tokens but RED2 bonus, so I need to increase RED bonus by 2). For N10: I need WHITE1 more (since WHITE=2, need 3) and RED1 more. For N6: I need WHITE1 more and BLUE1 more. So N10 and N6 are both close. Increasing BLACK to 4 doesn't directly help N10 or N6 beyond what I already have (BLACK3 satisfies them). But it does help N5. However, N5 requires RED4, which is further away. N10 and N6 require only 1 more WHITE and 1 more RED/BLUE respectively. So focusing on N10 or N6 might be faster. I can aim to get a WHITE bonus and a RED bonus. L1_16 gives BLUE, not WHITE or RED. L1_2 gives BLACK, not WHITE or RED. L1_32 gives GREEN, not helpful. So none of the face-up cards directly give WHITE or RED bonuses. However, I can purchase L1_16 for 1 point and BLUE bonus, then aim to reserve or draw a WHITE or RED card. But I have 5 tokens, I could take tokens to set up for future purchases. Given my token count is low, I should consider taking tokens. But I need to be careful: taking 3 tokens would bring me to 8, which is fine. I could take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK (since board has WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=4). That would give me WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=1, bringing my tokens to 8. Then next turn I could purchase L1_32 (cost BLACK1 after bonus) using the BLACK token, gaining 1 point and GREEN bonus. Or I could purchase L1_16 now? Wait, I can purchase L1_16 now because I have 2 RED tokens and RED bonus 2, so cost RED2, which I have. That would consume my 2 RED tokens, leaving me with WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0, total 3 tokens. Then I could take 3 tokens next turn easily. Purchasing L1_16 gives me 1 point and BLUE bonus (BLUE becomes 3). That's immediate progress. However, I need to consider that the opponent is at 7 points and may be close to winning. I need to accelerate. Getting 1 point now is good, but I need nobles for 3 points. Increasing BLUE to 3 satisfies N6's BLUE requirement. For N6, I still need WHITE3 (I have WHITE2) and BLACK3 (I have BLACK3). So I need 1 more WHITE bonus. If I can get a WHITE bonus card, I could attract N6 soon. L1_16 doesn't help with WHITE. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_2 for free, increasing BLACK to 4, which satisfies N5's BLACK requirement. For N5, I need RED4 (I have RED2). So I need 2 more RED bonuses. That might take longer. So N6 is closer: I need 1 WHITE bonus and I already have BLUE3 (after L1_16) and BLACK3. So after purchasing L1_16, I would have BLUE3, and I need WHITE3. I have WHITE2, so I need one more WHITE bonus. I could aim to purchase a WHITE card from the deck or reserve one. But there are no WHITE bonus cards on the board currently (L1_19 is gone, L2_53 and L2_55 are WHITE but expensive). I could reserve a blind card from LEVEL_1 hoping for a WHITE bonus. That might be a good idea. Alternatively, I could take tokens now and reserve a WHITE card from the board if one appears later. Given the urgency, I think purchasing L1_16 for 1 point and BLUE3 is a solid move. It also consumes tokens, reducing my token count, which is fine. I'll do that.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_32]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_32
Reasoning: I previously attempted to purchase L1_32 but received an error for insufficient tokens. Let's recalculate: L1_32 costs BLACK:4. My bonuses are BLACK:3, GREEN:1, WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:2. After applying BLACK bonus of 3, the cost becomes BLACK:1 (4-3=1). I need to pay 1 BLACK token. I currently have 0 BLACK tokens (my tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:0). So indeed I cannot afford it because I lack the BLACK token. I must gather tokens first. Looking at board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:4, GOLD:5. I have 5 tokens currently (WHITE1+BLUE2+GREEN0+RED2+BLACK0=5). I can take up to 3 different tokens without exceeding 10. I need a BLACK token for L1_32. I can take BLACK plus two other colors. Available colors with tokens: WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK. I'll take BLACK, WHITE, and GREEN (since BLUE only has 1 and I might want to leave some for other players, but that's not required). Taking 1 BLACK, 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN would give me tokens: WHITE becomes 2, BLUE stays 2, GREEN becomes 1, RED stays 2, BLACK becomes 1. Total tokens become 8. That's fine. Then next turn I can purchase L1_32 using 1 BLACK token. However, I could also consider taking 2 BLACK tokens if possible? Board has 4 BLACK, so I can take 2 BLACK only if there are at least 4, which there are. But taking 2 of the same color requires that color to have at least 4 tokens, and I must take exactly 2 tokens total. That would give me 2 BLACK tokens, bringing my total tokens to 7. But then I would only have 2 BLACK tokens, which is more than needed for L1_32, but could be useful for other cards. However, taking 2 tokens instead of 3 is less efficient in terms of token acquisition. Since I have room to take 3 tokens without exceeding 10, I should take 3. So I'll take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK. This sets me up for L1_32 next turn, and also gives me WHITE and GREEN tokens which could help with other cards. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_12? L1_12 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus 2 reduces BLUE cost by 2, but BLUE cost is only 1, so becomes 0. GREEN bonus 1 reduces GREEN cost by 1, so need GREEN:2. RED bonus 2 reduces RED cost by 1? Actually RED cost is 1, so becomes 0. So effective cost is GREEN:2. I have 0 GREEN tokens now, so I need 2 GREEN. I could take GREEN tokens now, but board only has 1 GREEN token, so I cannot take 2 GREEN. So not feasible. L1_16 costs RED:4, after RED bonus 2 becomes RED:2, I have 2 RED tokens, so I could buy it now? Wait, I have 2 RED tokens, cost requires 2 RED after bonus, so I can afford it. L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point. That would increase my BLUE bonus to 3 and give me my first point! That's significant. I have 0 prestige points, opponent has 7. I need to start scoring. L1_16 is affordable now with my current tokens: cost RED:4, after RED bonus 2 => RED:2, I have exactly 2 RED tokens. So I can purchase it immediately without taking any tokens. That would give me 1 point and a BLUE bonus (increasing BLUE from 2 to 3). That also consumes my 2 RED tokens, reducing my token count from 5 to 3. That's good because it frees up token capacity. After purchase, my bonuses: BLUE=3, which satisfies N6's BLUE requirement (needs BLUE3). For N6, I also need WHITE3 and BLACK3. I have WHITE=2, BLACK=3, so after this purchase I would need 1 more WHITE for N6. That's very close. Alternatively, N10 requires WHITE3, RED3, BLACK3. I have WHITE2, RED2 (after consuming tokens, but bonuses remain RED2), BLACK3. So I would need 1 more WHITE and 1 more RED for N10. So purchasing L1_16 brings me closer to nobles and gives a point. It's better than taking tokens for L1_32 which only gives 1 point and a GREEN bonus (less critical). I should purchase L1_16 now.

Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 7, and I need to reach 15 points efficiently. My current tokens are WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:0, and my bonuses are WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2. I have reserved cards L1_39 and L2_58. L2_58 gives 3 points and requires WHITE:6, but with my WHITE bonus of 2, the effective cost is WHITE:4. I currently have WHITE:1, so I need 3 more WHITE-equivalent tokens (white tokens or gold tokens). The board has WHITE:2 available, so I can take up to 1 WHITE token per turn (since taking 2 WHITE requires at least 4 available, which is not the case). Taking tokens including WHITE allows me to accumulate WHITE tokens directly. I also need to consider other point opportunities, but L2_58 is the most efficient point card available to me currently. Purchasing L1_39 would cost 1 WHITE token and give no points, which is less efficient. Purchasing board cards like L1_2 or L2_42 would give no points or only 1 point, which is slower than focusing on L2_58. Therefore, taking tokens including WHITE, along with other colors that might be useful for future purchases (like BLACK for L2_42), is the best action. I will take WHITE:1, BLACK:1, and RED:1 to start accumulating WHITE tokens while also gaining BLACK and RED tokens for potential future purchases. My token count will be 9 after this action, so no tokens need to be returned.

Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 0 points and need to catch up to my opponent's 7 points. Purchasing L2_55 gives 2 points immediately and increases my WHITE bonus from 2 to 3, satisfying the WHITE requirement for nobles N10 and N6. This puts me one bonus away from attracting either noble: for N10, I need one more RED bonus; for N6, I need one more BLUE bonus. The effective cost of L2_55 is 2 RED tokens after applying my bonuses (GREEN1 covers GREEN cost, RED2 reduces RED4 to RED2, BLACK3 covers BLACK cost), and I have exactly 2 RED tokens. Other affordable cards like L1_16 (1 point, BLUE bonus) or L1_2 (0 points, BLACK bonus) are less impactful now. L2_55 provides the most points and critical bonus progression, accelerating my path to nobles and scoring.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 7, needing 8 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, and bonuses are WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:2. I have reserved cards L1_39 and L2_58. L2_58 requires 4 white tokens after bonuses, but I have only 2 white tokens, so I need more white-equivalent tokens. However, there are immediate point opportunities on the board: L2_53 and L2_42 each require only one additional black token to be purchased (for 1 point each). With my current tokens, I cannot purchase any point card immediately. Taking tokens would require returning tokens due to the 10-token limit, which is inefficient. Reserving a card gives me a gold token without taking tokens, bringing my token count to 10. With one gold token, I can purchase either L2_53 or L2_42 next turn by using the gold to cover the missing black token. This action sets up efficient point gain without token return. I will reserve from the Level 2 deck blindly to gain a gold token and a random card for future use.

======================================================================================

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 2 points, opponent has 7. My bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0, total 3 tokens. I need to attract nobles for 3 points each. I'm closest to N10 (needs BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3) and N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3). For N10, I have BLACK3, WHITE3, RED2 -> need 1 RED. For N6, I have BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE2 -> need 1 BLUE. So acquiring either a RED or BLUE bonus will give me a noble, scoring 3 points. I have 0 RED and 0 GREEN tokens, so I can't purchase any card that requires paying tokens of those colors unless I take tokens first. However, I can purchase L1_12 which gives a BLUE bonus. Its cost: BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1. After my bonuses: BLUE bonus reduces BLUE cost by 2 (I have BLUE=2) -> 0; GREEN bonus reduces GREEN by 1 -> need GREEN2; RED bonus reduces RED by 2 -> 0. So effective cost is 2 GREEN tokens. I have 0 GREEN tokens, so I cannot afford it now. Alternatively, L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point, cost RED4. After bonuses: RED bonus reduces RED by 2 -> need RED2. I have 0 RED tokens, so cannot afford. L1_2 gives BLACK bonus, cost WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1. After bonuses: WHITE3 covers WHITE1, BLUE2 covers BLUE2, GREEN1 covers GREEN1, RED2 covers RED1 -> cost 0 tokens. That's a free purchase! It increases my BLACK bonus from 3 to 4, which satisfies N5 (BLACK4, RED4) partially, but I still need RED4 (I have RED2). However, it gives 0 points. But free purchases are good because they increase bonuses without spending tokens. However, L1_2 is a BLACK bonus, which I already have 3 of. Getting to 4 BLACK is good for N5, but N5 also requires RED4, which is further away. Alternatively, I could take tokens to set up for purchasing L1_12 or L1_16. But taking tokens would bring my token count from 3 to 6, which is fine. However, I need to consider that I have very few tokens, and taking tokens might be necessary to afford future purchases. But if I can make a free purchase now, that's efficient. L1_2 is free and increases BLACK to 4. That makes N5 require only RED4 (I have RED2). But N10 and N6 are closer: each need only one more bonus. I should focus on getting either a RED or BLUE bonus. Which is easier? To get a RED bonus, I could purchase L1_12? No, L1_12 gives BLUE. There's no RED bonus card on the board except L2_70 (cost RED6, too expensive) and L2_69 (cost BLACK5, but I have no BLACK tokens). So no immediate RED bonus available. For BLUE bonus, L1_12 and L1_16 are available. L1_16 requires RED tokens, which I have none. L1_12 requires GREEN tokens, which I have none. So I need to gather tokens first. However, I could reserve a card to get a gold token, but reserving doesn't give immediate benefit. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_2 for free now, then take tokens next turn to set up for L1_12 or L1_16. That seems reasonable. But I also need to consider that the opponent is ahead with 7 points and may be close to winning. I need points quickly. Getting a noble gives 3 points, which would bring me to 5, still behind but closer. So I should prioritize getting that one missing bonus. To get a BLUE bonus, I need GREEN tokens. I can take tokens: available tokens on board: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. I have 3 tokens currently, so I can take up to 3 different colors. I need GREEN and maybe RED for L1_16. If I take GREEN, RED, and BLACK (for example), that would give me 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, bringing my tokens to 6. Then next turn I could purchase L1_16 (cost RED4 after bonuses -> need RED2) but I'd have only 1 RED, so not enough. Or L1_12 (need GREEN2) but I'd have only 1 GREEN. So I'd need to take two of the same color? For L1_16, I need 2 RED tokens. I could take 2 RED tokens if available (board has 2 RED), but the rule says I can take 2 of same color only if there are 4+ available. There are only 2 RED, so I cannot take 2 RED. So I can only take 1 RED. That means I cannot get enough RED for L1_16 in one turn. For L1_12, I need 2 GREEN tokens. Board has only 1 GREEN, so I cannot take 2 GREEN. So I cannot get enough tokens in one turn to purchase either BLUE bonus card. Therefore, I need to plan for two turns of token gathering, or use a gold token? I have no gold. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_2 now (free), then next turn take tokens (e.g., GREEN, RED, BLACK) and then the following turn take more tokens (maybe again) to accumulate enough. That seems slow. Another option: reserve a card to get a gold token, which could substitute for missing GREEN or RED. But reserving doesn't give me the bonus I need immediately. I think the fastest path to a noble is to get a RED bonus. But there is no RED bonus card on the board that I can afford soon. However, the opponent has a reserved card L1_39 which gives RED bonus, but that's not available. Maybe I should consider purchasing L1_32? It gives 1 point and GREEN bonus, not helpful for nobles. But 1 point is something. Cost BLACK4, after BLACK bonus=3 -> need BLACK1. I have 0 BLACK tokens, but board has 3 BLACK. I could take a BLACK token now (along with two other colors) to get 1 BLACK. But I need to take 3 different colors. I can take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK (since WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=3 available). That would give me 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK, bringing my token count to 6. Then I could purchase L1_32 next turn using the BLACK token, gaining 1 point and a GREEN bonus. That would bring me to 3 points. Not great. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_2 now for free (0 points, BLACK bonus), then take tokens next turn to set up for something else. That seems like a wasted turn because it doesn't give points or progress toward a noble significantly. Wait, increasing BLACK to 4 does not help with N10 or N6, only N5, which requires RED4. So it's not directly helpful. I think I should aim for the BLUE bonus to get N6. To get L1_12, I need 2 GREEN tokens. I can take 1 GREEN now, but need another GREEN later. I could take GREEN now and reserve a card to get a gold token, then use gold as a substitute for the second GREEN. But reserving costs a turn. Alternatively, I could take GREEN, RED, BLACK now, then next turn take GREEN, something, something? But next turn I can only take 3 tokens again, but if I take another GREEN, that would be 2 GREEN total, but I need to check if taking 2 GREEN is allowed: board currently has 1 GREEN, after I take 1, it will have 0, so next turn if it replenishes? Actually, after each purchase, tokens are returned, but we don't know the replenishment. Assuming the board tokens are static until someone takes them. After I take 1 GREEN, board will have 0 GREEN. So I cannot take a second GREEN later because there will be none. So that plan fails. Therefore, L1_12 is not feasible in the short term. L1_16 requires RED tokens: board has 2 RED. I can take 1 RED now, but cannot take 2 RED because need 4+ to take two. So same issue. So the only affordable card right now is L1_2 (free) and maybe L1_32 if I get a BLACK token. I think I should take tokens now to set up for future purchases. I have only 3 tokens, so I can take 3 more without exceeding 10. I should take tokens that will help me purchase a card that gives the missing bonus. Which colors do I need? For N6, I need a BLUE bonus. So I need to purchase a BLUE bonus card. The cheapest BLUE bonus card is L1_12 (needs GREEN) or L1_16 (needs RED). Both require tokens I don't have. I need to accumulate either 2 GREEN or 2 RED tokens (after bonuses). Since I cannot take 2 of the same color in one turn, I need two turns to accumulate them. That's slow. Maybe I should consider reserving a BLUE bonus card from the deck to get a gold token, and then use that gold to help purchase another card. But reserving doesn't give me the bonus immediately. However, it could give me a card that I can purchase later. But I need points now. Another thought: perhaps I should aim for a RED bonus to get N10. There is no RED bonus card on the board, but there is L2_70 (RED bonus, 3 points) but it costs RED6, which is too expensive. L2_69 (RED bonus, 2 points) costs BLACK5, which I could aim for with my BLACK bonuses. After bonuses, BLACK5 becomes BLACK2 (since BLACK bonus=3). I have 0 BLACK tokens, but I could take BLACK tokens. I need 2 BLACK tokens. I can take 1 BLACK now, and maybe another later. That might be feasible. L2_69 gives 2 points and a RED bonus, which would give me N10 (since I have WHITE3, BLACK3, RED2+1=3). So that's 3 points from noble + 2 points from card = 5 points total, bringing me to 7 points, tying the opponent. That's a good plan. So I should aim to purchase L2_69. To afford L2_69, cost BLACK5. After BLACK bonus=3, need BLACK2. I need 2 BLACK tokens. Board has 3 BLACK tokens available. I can take 1 BLACK token now, and then next turn take another BLACK token (if still available) or use a gold token. But taking 2 BLACK tokens requires two turns because I cannot take 2 BLACK in one turn (since only 3 available, need 4+ to take two). So I need to take 1 BLACK now and 1 BLACK later. That will take two turns of token gathering, plus a purchase turn, so three turns total. That's slow, but maybe the best option. Alternatively, I could take 1 BLACK now and reserve a card to get a gold token, then use gold as the second BLACK. That might be faster? Reserve a card this turn, get a gold, then next turn purchase L2_69 using 1 BLACK token + 1 gold. That's two turns: turn 1 reserve (get gold), turn 2 purchase. But reserving doesn't guarantee I can purchase next turn because I need a BLACK token. I would have 1 BLACK token after taking one this turn. But if I reserve this turn, I don't take any tokens, so I would still have only 3 tokens, no BLACK. So I need to combine taking a BLACK token with reserving? I cannot do both; I must choose one action per turn. So I could take a BLACK token this turn (along with two other colors), then next turn reserve a card to get a gold token, then the following turn purchase. That's three turns. Or I could reserve this turn (get gold), then next turn take a BLACK token, then following turn purchase. Also three turns. Too slow. Maybe I should just purchase L1_2 now for free, increasing BLACK to 4, which doesn't help immediately but maybe later. I need to think differently. Perhaps I should take tokens now to increase my flexibility. I have 3 tokens, so I can take 3 more. I'll take tokens that are most needed: BLACK (for L2_69), RED (for L1_16), and GREEN (for L1_12). But I can only take one of each. So I'll take 1 BLACK, 1 RED, 1 GREEN. That will give me tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, total 6. Then next turn I can take another BLACK if available? Board after my take: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=2. So next turn I could take 2 BLACK if there are at least 4? No, only 2 left, so I can only take 1 BLACK. So I'd have 2 BLACK tokens, enough for L2_69. But I also need to consider that the opponent might take tokens too. This seems like a plan: take BLACK, RED, GREEN now. Then next turn, take BLACK, something, something (maybe WHITE and BLUE if available). Then I can purchase L2_69. That's two turns of token gathering then purchase. That's three turns total including purchase. But maybe I can purchase something else earlier? After taking tokens this turn, I'll have 1 BLACK, 1 RED, 1 GREEN. Can I purchase L1_16? Cost RED4 after bonuses -> need RED2, I have 1 RED, so no. L1_12? Need GREEN2, I have 1 GREEN, so no. L1_32? Need BLACK1, I have 1 BLACK, so yes! I can purchase L1_32 next turn, gaining 1 point and a GREEN bonus. That's not helpful for nobles but gives a point. Then I could still aim for L2_69 later. That might be okay: take tokens now, purchase L1_32 next turn (1 point), then take more tokens, then purchase L2_69. But that's even slower. I think I should go for the noble directly. Let's evaluate the free purchase of L1_2: it gives 0 points, increases BLACK to 4. That doesn't get me closer to N10 or N6, only N5. N5 requires RED4, which is far. So not good. What about purchasing L1_16? I can't afford it now. So maybe taking tokens is the best. But I also need to consider that I have only 3 tokens, which is low. Taking tokens will bring me to 6, which is a healthy amount. I'll take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK? But I need GREEN or RED for future purchases. Let's look at the board tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. I should take colors that are scarce: WHITE and BLUE are only 1 each, so if I don't take them, the opponent might. But I don't urgently need WHITE or BLUE tokens. I need BLACK and RED. I'll take BLACK, RED, and one more. GREEN is also useful. I'll take BLACK, RED, GREEN. That seems optimal. So action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_BLACK=1, take_RED=1, take_GREEN=1. But wait, I must take exactly 3 different colors, or 2 of the same. I'm taking 3 different, so that's valid. Let's double-check token counts after: my current tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0. After taking: GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1. Total becomes 6. No need to return. Yes. Then next turn I can take more tokens (maybe another BLACK and something else) to afford L2_69. But I also need to consider that the opponent might purchase or reserve cards. However, I think this is a reasonable move. But before finalizing, let's see if there's any immediate purchase I can make that gives a BLUE or RED bonus. None. So I'll take tokens.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_12]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_12
Reasoning: I have 3 tokens total (WHITE=1, BLUE=2, others 0). My bonuses are WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3. I need to acquire more tokens to purchase cards. Available tokens on board: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=4. I can take exactly 3 different colors. Since I only have 3 tokens, taking 3 more will bring me to 6, well under the 10 limit. I should prioritize colors that help me buy the next cards to progress towards nobles. I need RED and BLUE bonuses to attract N10 (requires RED3) and N6 (requires BLUE3). Currently, I have RED=2, BLUE=2. So I need one more RED and one more BLUE. Looking at affordable cards: L1_16 costs RED4, after RED bonus=2, need RED2. I have 0 RED tokens, so I need 2 RED tokens. L1_12 costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1; after bonuses BLUE0, need GREEN3+RED1. I have 0 GREEN tokens, and GREEN bonus=1 reduces cost to GREEN2+RED1. Not currently affordable. L1_2 costs WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1; after bonuses: WHITE3 reduces WHITE1 to 0, BLUE2 reduces BLUE2 to 0, GREEN1 reduces GREEN1 to 0, RED2 reduces RED1 to 0, so cost 0 tokens, but it gives BLACK bonus which I don't urgently need (already BLACK=3). However, it's free and would give me a BLACK bonus, but that doesn't help my immediate noble goals. Better to take tokens to set up for L1_16 (1 point, BLUE bonus) which requires 2 RED tokens. So I should take RED tokens. I can take 2 RED tokens if available? Wait, board has 2 RED tokens, but I must take exactly 3 different colors if taking 3 tokens. I cannot take 2 RED and another color because that would be 2 RED and 1 other, which is invalid (must be 3 different colors each 1, or 2 of the same color if 4+ available). RED has only 2 on board, so I cannot take 2 RED. So I must take 3 different colors each 1. I should take colors that I need: RED is crucial, also BLUE maybe, and perhaps BLACK or GREEN. I have 0 BLACK tokens, and L1_32 costs BLACK4, after BLACK bonus=3 need BLACK1, so a BLACK token could be useful. Also, L1_2 is free, but I can buy it anytime. I think taking RED, BLUE, and BLACK would be beneficial because: RED for L1_16, BLUE for future BLUE cards, BLACK for L1_32 or other. Available tokens: RED=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3, WHITE=1, GREEN=1. I can take RED, BLUE, BLACK each 1. That's valid. After taking, I'll have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=1, total 6. Then next turn I can consider buying L1_16 if I get another RED token, or L1_2 for free, or L1_32 with BLACK token. This seems like a solid plan. Alternatively, I could take RED, GREEN, BLACK to get GREEN for L1_12, but I need 2 GREEN tokens total after bonuses, so one GREEN token is not enough. I think RED, BLUE, BLACK is better. I should avoid returning tokens because I have only 3 tokens currently. So action: take RED=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_53 from the board immediately using my current tokens and gold token. The cost after bonuses is GREEN:1, RED:2, and BLACK:2. I have GREEN:3, so I can pay 1 green token; I have RED:2, so I can pay 2 red tokens; for BLACK:2, I have BLACK:1 and GOLD:1, so I can use the gold token to cover the second black token. This action gains me 1 prestige point, bringing my score to 8, and increases my WHITE bonus to 3. This reduces the effective cost of my reserved L2_58 from 4 white tokens to 3 white tokens, making it easier to purchase in future turns. Purchasing L2_53 now is more efficient than taking tokens or reserving cards, as it directly advances my score and improves my engine for reaching 15 points.

======================================================================================

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=1) and bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=3). I need to gain points and progress towards nobles. Affordable cards: L1_2 (cost WHITE1, BLUE2, GREEN1, RED1). After applying bonuses: WHITE3 reduces WHITE1 to 0, BLUE2 reduces BLUE2 to 0, GREEN1 reduces GREEN1 to 0, RED2 reduces RED1 to 0. So effective cost is 0 tokens. Purchasing L1_2 gives a BLACK bonus (increasing BLACK from 3 to 4) and 0 points. Increasing BLACK to 4 satisfies the BLACK requirement for N5 (needs BLACK4, RED4) and already satisfies N10 and N6. Now I need RED4 for N5 and RED3 for N10, and BLUE3 for N6. My RED bonus is 2, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. Alternatively, L1_16 (cost RED4) after RED bonus=2 requires RED2 tokens, but I only have 1 RED token, so not affordable. L1_12 requires GREEN and RED tokens after bonuses, I have 0 GREEN. L1_32 requires BLACK1 after bonuses, I have 1 BLACK token, but it gives 1 point and GREEN bonus. However, L1_32 is not as critical because GREEN bonus is less needed. Purchasing L1_2 for free advances my BLACK bonus to 4, which is a big step toward N5 (only need RED4 now) and also makes N5 more attainable. It also doesn't consume tokens, keeping my token count at 6, which allows me to take more tokens next turn. Taking tokens now could set up for future purchases, but I should capitalize on free purchases when available. Also, note that my opponent has 8 points and may be close to winning. I need to score points quickly. While L1_2 gives 0 points, it brings me closer to attracting nobles worth 3 points each. Alternatively, I could take tokens to gather RED tokens for L1_16 (1 point, BLUE bonus) or L1_12 (0 points, BLUE bonus). However, L1_16 requires 2 RED tokens, and I have 1 RED token; board has 3 RED tokens, so I could take RED and another color. But taking tokens would bring me to 9 tokens, which is okay. However, I think securing the BLACK bonus now is more efficient because it immediately satisfies N5's BLACK requirement. Also, I should consider that I have only 6 tokens, and taking 3 tokens would bring me to 9, but then I might not be able to purchase L1_16 if I don't get the second RED token. Actually, if I take RED, GREEN, and WHITE (since BLUE is 0 on board), I could get RED1, GREEN1, WHITE1. That would give me RED=2, GREEN=1, WHITE=2, BLUE=3, BLACK=1. Then I could buy L1_16 next turn because I'd have 2 RED tokens. But that's two turns away from a noble. Alternatively, buy L1_2 now, then next turn take tokens to get RED tokens, then aim for L1_16 or other cards. I think buying L1_2 now is better because it's free and progresses my engine. Also, it denies the card to opponent, though they might not want it. Let's check if there are any cards that give points: L1_32 gives 1 point, costs BLACK1 after bonuses, I have 1 BLACK token. I could buy L1_32 now for 1 BLACK token, gaining 1 point and GREEN bonus. That would increase my score to 3. But the GREEN bonus is less valuable. However, 1 point is immediate progress. But noble attraction gives 3 points, so I should prioritize that. Increasing BLACK to 4 gets me closer to N5, which is 3 points. I need to compare: if I buy L1_32, I get 1 point now, but I still need RED4 for N5. If I buy L1_2, I get 0 points now, but I'm one step closer to N5. Actually, after buying L1_2, my BLACK is 4, and I need RED4 for N5. I have RED bonus=2, so I need 2 more RED bonuses. That's not trivial. Maybe I should focus on N10: I need RED3 and WHITE3 (already have WHITE3). So I need one more RED bonus. That's easier. So after buying L1_2, I have WHITE3, BLACK3, RED2, so I need one more RED bonus to attract N10. That's very close. I could aim for L1_12 (BLUE bonus) or L1_16 (BLUE bonus) to also progress toward N6, but N10 is more immediate. I think buying L1_2 is good because it also makes N5 possible later. However, I should check if there's a card that gives RED bonus: L1_12 gives BLUE, L1_16 gives BLUE, L1_32 gives GREEN. No RED bonus available. So I need to either reserve a RED card or wait for one to appear. That suggests that maybe I should reserve a RED card? But reserving costs a turn and I might get a gold token. However, I have 0 gold tokens now. I could reserve a level 1 card blindly to get a gold token, but that's not efficient. Maybe I should take tokens to prepare for purchasing a RED bonus card when it appears. But given the current face-up cards, there's no RED bonus card. However, my opponent has reserved L1_39 (RED bonus) and L2_58 (WHITE bonus) and L2_50 (BLUE bonus). So L1_39 is a RED bonus card that is reserved. That means it might become available if opponent buys it? But they haven't yet. There's also L2_70 (RED bonus, 3 points) but too expensive. So maybe I should focus on BLUE bonus for N6. I have BLUE=2, need one more. L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point, requires RED2 tokens. I have 1 RED token, so I need one more RED token. I could take RED and another color now, then next turn buy L1_16. That gives me 1 point and BLUE=3, satisfying N6's BLUE requirement. Then I would have WHITE3, BLUE3, BLACK3, attracting N6 for 3 points, total 4+3=7 points. That's a good plan. But wait, I also need to have the noble visit me; I need to have the bonuses at the time of purchase? Actually nobles are attracted at the end of turn if you meet their requirements. So if I buy L1_16, my BLUE becomes 3, and I already have WHITE3 and BLACK3, so N6 would be attracted immediately, giving me 3 points. So total points would be 2 (current) + 1 (L1_16) + 3 (N6) = 6 points. That's significant. However, I need to have the tokens to buy L1_16. It costs RED4, after RED bonus=2, need RED2 tokens. I have 1 RED token, so I need one more RED token. I can take RED token now, but I must take 3 different colors. Available tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3. I can take RED, GREEN, BLACK (since BLUE is 0). That would give me RED=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1. After taking, I'd have RED=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=2, WHITE=1, BLUE=3. Then I could buy L1_16 next turn using 2 RED tokens. That works. But note: taking RED, GREEN, BLACK would bring my token count to 9 (since I have 6, +3 =9). That's okay. Alternatively, I could take RED, WHITE, BLACK. That would give RED=1, WHITE=1, BLACK=1. After taking, RED=2, WHITE=2, BLACK=2, BLUE=3. That also works. But WHITE token is less needed. I think taking RED, GREEN, BLACK is fine. But then I would not have purchased anything this turn. Is that optimal? My opponent is at 8 points, close to 15. I need to accelerate. Buying L1_2 gives 0 points but advances BLACK to 4, which doesn't immediately attract a noble. Buying L1_32 gives 1 point but not a noble. Taking tokens sets up for L1_16 next turn, which gives 1 point and attracts N6 for 3 points, total +4 points in two turns. That seems better. However, I could also buy L1_2 now, and then next turn take tokens to set up for L1_16, but then attracting N6 would be delayed another turn because I need BLUE=3, and L1_2 doesn't give BLUE. Actually, after buying L1_2, my BLUE remains 2, so I still need another BLUE bonus to attract N6. So I would need to buy L1_16 anyway. So buying L1_2 now doesn't speed up N6; it just gives me an extra BLACK bonus which might help for N5 later. But N5 requires RED4, which is further away. So I think the faster path to points is to take tokens now to enable L1_16 next turn, attracting N6. That yields 4 points in two turns. Alternatively, I could buy L1_32 now (1 point) and then take tokens next turn for L1_16, but then I wouldn't attract N6 because BLUE would still be 2. Actually, L1_32 gives GREEN, not BLUE. So that doesn't help. So the sequence should be: turn 1 (now): take tokens RED, GREEN, BLACK. Turn 2: buy L1_16 (cost RED2), gaining BLUE bonus and 1 point, attracting N6 (3 points). That's 4 points total added. But wait, I currently have 2 points, so after that I'd have 6 points. That's still behind opponent's 8, but closer. Meanwhile, opponent might win soon. Alternatively, maybe I can attract N10 sooner? For N10, I need RED3. I have RED2, so I need one more RED bonus. There's no RED bonus card available. I could reserve a RED card from deck, but that's uncertain. So N10 is not imminent. N6 is more immediate because I only need one more BLUE bonus, and L1_16 provides it. So I should go for N6. Therefore, I should take tokens to afford L1_16. However, I need to ensure I take exactly 3 different colors. Available tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=3, BLACK=3. I cannot take BLUE because there are 0. So I must take RED, GREEN, and BLACK (or RED, WHITE, BLACK, or RED, WHITE, GREEN). I need RED token for sure, and I also need a second RED token? Actually, I need 2 RED tokens total to buy L1_16. Currently I have 1 RED token. If I take only 1 RED token, I'll have 2 RED tokens, which is enough. So taking RED, GREEN, BLACK gives me RED=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1. That works. After taking, I'll have RED=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=2, WHITE=1, BLUE=3. Total tokens 9. Next turn, I can buy L1_16 using 2 RED tokens, leaving me with RED=0, GREEN=1, BLACK=2, WHITE=1, BLUE=3, total tokens 7. That's fine. So the plan is solid. I should take tokens now.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=4}
Reasoning: I need to purchase L2_58 for 3 points, but I currently lack one white token (I have 2 white tokens, and need 3 after bonuses). The board has one white token available, so I can take it along with other tokens to accumulate resources. Taking white, red, and black tokens allows me to reach the required white tokens for L2_58 while also gaining red and black tokens for future purchases like L2_50. This action uses 3 tokens, bringing my total to 8, which is under the 10-token limit, so no tokens need to be returned. This sets up an efficient path to gain points: next turn I can purchase L2_58 for 3 points, increasing my score to 11 and boosting my white bonus to 4, making it easier to purchase other reserved cards.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I currently have 9 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=2, BLACK=2) and bonuses (WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4). I need to score points quickly; opponent has 8 points. Last turn I took tokens to enable purchasing L1_16, which costs RED4. After applying RED bonus=2, effective cost is 2 RED tokens, which I now have exactly (RED=2). Purchasing L1_16 gives 1 prestige point and a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus from 2 to 3. This satisfies the BLUE requirement for noble N6 (needs BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3). I already have WHITE=3 and BLACK=4, so immediately after purchasing L1_16, I will attract N6 for an additional 3 prestige points. Total points gained this turn: 1 (card) + 3 (noble) = 4, bringing my total from 2 to 6. This is the fastest point gain available. Other options: purchasing L1_32 costs BLACK1 after bonuses (I have BLACK=2) and gives 1 point and GREEN bonus, but that does not trigger a noble. L1_12 is not affordable (needs GREEN and RED tokens after bonuses). L1_18 gives WHITE bonus but 0 points and I don't need more WHITE. The purchase of L1_16 is optimal and aligns with my previous plan. Token count after purchase: I will spend 2 RED tokens, leaving me with RED=0, total tokens 7, well under 10. No need to return tokens. Action must be PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_16.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_16]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_16
Reasoning: I need to re-analyze the current state after my previous invalid action. I attempted to purchase L1_16 but had insufficient tokens. Let's recalculate the cost of L1_16: it costs RED:4. My bonuses: RED=2, so after applying bonuses, I need RED2 tokens. I have 1 RED token. So I cannot afford it yet. I must take more tokens first. However, the board token counts have changed: WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:5. I have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=1, total 6. I need to take tokens to afford L1_16. I need at least one more RED token. But I must take exactly 3 different colors (each 1) because no color has 4+ to take 2 of the same. Available colors with tokens: GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2. WHITE and BLUE are 0. So I can take GREEN, RED, BLACK each 1. That would give me RED=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=2, and I would have 9 tokens total. Then next turn I could buy L1_16 using 2 RED tokens. However, I must be careful: after taking tokens, my token count will be 9, which is fine. Alternatively, I could purchase a different card now. Let's check other affordable cards. L1_32: cost BLACK:4, after BLACK bonus=4, cost BLACK0. So I can purchase L1_32 for free, gaining 1 point and GREEN bonus. That would increase my score to 3 and GREEN bonus to 2. That's a good immediate point gain. L1_12: cost BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1. After bonuses: BLUE=2 reduces BLUE1 to 0, GREEN=1 reduces GREEN3 to GREEN2, RED=2 reduces RED1 to 0. So effective cost: GREEN2. I have 0 GREEN tokens, cannot afford. L1_18: cost BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1. After bonuses: BLUE2 reduces BLUE1 to 0, GREEN1 reduces GREEN2 to GREEN1, RED2 reduces RED1 to 0, BLACK4 reduces BLACK1 to 0. So effective cost: GREEN1. I have 0 GREEN tokens, cannot afford. L1_2: I already purchased it. So the only affordable card right now is L1_32. Buying L1_32 gives 1 point and progresses my GREEN bonus, but does not help with nobles immediately. However, it's a free purchase and uses no tokens. After buying L1_32, my token count remains 6, and I can then take tokens next turn to set up for L1_16. But that delays the noble attraction by one turn. Alternatively, I could take tokens now to set up for L1_16 next turn. Which is better? My opponent has 8 points and may be close to winning. I need points fast. The sequence of taking tokens now and buying L1_16 next turn yields 1 point from L1_16 + 3 points from N6 = 4 points total, bringing me to 6 points. That's two turns from now. If I buy L1_32 now, I get 1 point immediately (total 3), then next turn take tokens, then following turn buy L1_16 and attract N6, that's three turns to gain 4 points (total 6). That's slower. However, buying L1_32 now is a guaranteed point this turn, and I can still take tokens next turn. But I must also consider that the opponent might take L1_16 or other cards. However, L1_16 is a BLUE bonus card; the opponent is heavy on BLUE, but they have reserved cards and may not need it. I think the faster path is to take tokens now to enable L1_16 next turn. That gives me the chance to attract N6 next turn. So I should take tokens: GREEN, RED, BLACK each 1.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_16]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_16
Reasoning: I need to re-analyze after the error. My last action was attempting to purchase L1_16, but the engine said insufficient tokens. That means I attempted to buy L1_16 but didn't have enough tokens. Let's examine current state: My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=0, RED=1, BLACK=1. Bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. L1_16 costs RED=4. After applying RED bonus of 2, I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I have only 1 RED token, so indeed insufficient. In my reasoning, I thought I had taken tokens RED, GREEN, BLACK, but the error indicates I didn't take them; I must have attempted to purchase L1_16 directly without taking tokens. Looking at the previous reasoning, I concluded to take tokens, but my action must have been something else. The error says 'Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_16', meaning I attempted to purchase L1_16. That was a mistake. I need to correct: I should take tokens as planned to get the second RED token. Available tokens on board: WHITE=0, BLUE=0, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2, GOLD=5. I can take exactly 3 different colors, but WHITE and BLUE are 0, so I cannot take them. Available colors with at least 1 token: GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2. I can take GREEN, RED, BLACK each 1. That is valid. I have 6 tokens currently, taking 3 will bring me to 9, under 10, no need to return. This will give me RED=2 (since I have 1, +1 =2), GREEN=1, BLACK=2. Then next turn I can buy L1_16 with 2 RED tokens. That's the correct plan. Alternatively, I could consider purchasing L1_2 for free, but that doesn't give points. I need points quickly. The sequence of taking tokens now and buying L1_16 next turn yields 1 point from card and 3 points from noble N6 (since I'll have BLUE=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3). That's 4 points total, bringing me from 2 to 6. Opponent has 8, still behind but closer. Another option: I could buy L1_32 for 1 point now using my BLACK token, but that doesn't help with noble. I think taking tokens is the right move to set up the big point gain next turn.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_58 immediately because I have 3 white tokens and a white bonus of 3, effectively covering the cost of 6 white tokens. This gains 3 points, increasing my score to 11 and boosting my white bonus to 4 for future purchases. This is the most efficient action to gain points towards 15 without wasting turns on token accumulation or reserving.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=6}
Reasoning: I have 2 points, opponent has 11 (dangerously close to 15). I must maximize points quickly. My bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. I can attract noble N6 (BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3) by gaining one more BLUE bonus. L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point, costing RED4. After RED bonus=2, I need 2 RED tokens. Currently I have RED=2 tokens, so I could buy L1_16 NOW. Wait, check: my tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. Total 9 tokens. L1_16 cost: RED4. After RED bonus=2, need RED2. I have exactly 2 RED tokens. So I can purchase L1_16 immediately. That would give me 1 point and increase BLUE bonus to 3, which would then attract noble N6 (since I already have WHITE=3 and BLACK=4). N6 gives 3 points, so total gain = 4 points, bringing my score to 6. That's the fastest point gain available. I should do that this turn. However, I must verify that I won't exceed 10 tokens after purchasing. Purchasing consumes 2 RED tokens, leaving me with RED=0, total tokens = 7, well under 10. So purchasing L1_16 is possible and optimal. There's no need to take tokens first. I had previously planned to take tokens because I thought I only had 1 RED token, but now I see I have 2 RED tokens. Therefore, I should purchase L1_16 now. Alternative: L1_32 gives 1 point and GREEN bonus, but that doesn't attract a noble (GREEN bonus is not needed for any noble I'm close to). N10 requires RED3, I have RED2, so need one more RED bonus, but no RED bonus cards available. N5 requires RED4, far away. So L1_16 is the best immediate point gain. I should buy L1_16 now.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I need to set up to purchase L1_16 next turn, which costs 4 RED tokens, but with my RED bonus of 2, I need to pay 2 RED tokens. Currently I have 2 RED tokens, so I already have enough to buy L1_16. However, I also need to consider my token count: I have 9 tokens total (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2). That's below 10, so I could purchase L1_16 now if I wanted. But wait, I just took tokens in the previous turn? The game state shows my tokens as WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2, which matches the planned token grab from previous reasoning (I took GREEN, RED, BLACK). The error message says 'Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.' That suggests my previous action was not properly formatted. I should now take the correct action. Given I already have the tokens, I should purchase L1_16 this turn to gain the BLUE bonus and 1 point, attracting noble N6 for 3 points. That will bring my score from 2 to 6. However, I must verify that I have enough tokens to purchase L1_16. Effective cost: L1_16 costs RED=4. My RED bonus is 2, so I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I have exactly 2 RED tokens. I also have other tokens that could be used as substitutes, but I don't need them. I can purchase L1_16 now. That is the best move because it gives immediate points and triggers N6. Let's confirm: after purchasing, my BLUE bonus increases from 2 to 3. That gives me WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=3, attracting N6. My total tokens after purchase will be 9 - 2 = 7 tokens, which is fine. No need to return tokens. Therefore, I should purchase L1_16.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I need to gather tokens to purchase L1_16, which costs RED4. After my RED bonus of 2, I need 2 RED tokens. I currently have 1 RED token, so I need one more. I have 6 tokens total, so I can take 3 more without exceeding 10. Available tokens on board: WHITE=3, BLUE=0, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=5. I must take exactly 3 different colors, each 1 token. Since BLUE is 0, I cannot take BLUE. I need RED, so I will take RED. I also need other colors that might be useful. GREEN and BLACK are available. Taking GREEN and BLACK could be useful for future purchases (e.g., L1_32 requires BLACK1 after bonuses; I have BLACK bonus 4, so L1_32 costs BLACK0? Actually L1_32 costs BLACK4, after BLACK bonus 4 -> 0, so I could buy it for free later). But taking GREEN and BLACK now gives me flexibility. So I will take RED, GREEN, and BLACK each 1. This will bring my tokens to: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1+1=2, RED=1+1=2, BLACK=1+1=2, total 9. Next turn, I can purchase L1_16 using 2 RED tokens, gaining 1 point and a BLUE bonus, which will increase my BLUE bonus to 3, satisfying the BLUE requirement for noble N6. Since I already have WHITE=3 and BLACK=4, noble N6 will be attracted immediately, giving me 3 points. Total points will be 2 (current) +1 (card) +3 (noble) = 6 points, closing the gap with opponent's 11. This is the fastest path to points given the current board. I must avoid taking tokens that would require returning, but I am at 6 tokens, taking 3 to 9, so no return needed.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I need to reach 15 points from my current score of 11. The most efficient path is to purchase L2_63, which gives 2 points and increases my green bonus to 3. However, I currently have only 2 green tokens, but I need 3 green tokens to pay for L2_63 after my green bonus of 2 reduces the cost from 5 to 3. Therefore, I must take at least one green token this turn. Since I must take exactly three tokens, I will also take one red and one black token, as these will be useful for future purchases, such as L2_50, which gives 2 points but requires black tokens. After this turn, I will have enough green tokens to purchase L2_63 next turn, bringing my score to 13, and then I can focus on acquiring black tokens for L2_50 to reach 15 points. Taking these tokens does not exceed the 10-token limit, so no returns are needed.

======================================================================================

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=6}
Reasoning: I have 2 points, opponent has 11, so I'm far behind and need to catch up quickly. My current tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2, total 9 tokens. My bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. I want to purchase L1_16 to gain a BLUE bonus (bringing BLUE to 3) and 1 point, which will attract noble N6 (requirements: BLACK3, WHITE3, BLUE3) for an additional 3 points, netting 4 points total and bringing my score to 6. L1_16 costs RED=4. After applying my RED bonus of 2, I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I currently have exactly 2 RED tokens, so I can afford L1_16 right now. However, I need to consider that I have 9 tokens; purchasing L1_16 will consume 2 RED tokens, leaving me with 0 RED, and total tokens 7, which is fine. But I must check if there are any other immediate point opportunities. L1_32 gives 1 point and GREEN bonus, costing BLACK=4; after BLACK bonus=4, cost is 0 tokens, so it's free and gives 1 point. That would bring my score to 3 without consuming tokens, but it doesn't attract a noble because GREEN bonus is not needed for N6 or N10. However, it does increase my GREEN bonus to 2, which might help for other nobles later. But the noble N6 attraction is more valuable (3 points). So I should prioritize L1_16. However, I should also consider that my opponent is at 11, and if they reach 15, I lose. So I need to maximize points per turn. Could I attract N10? I need RED=3, currently RED=2, so one more RED bonus. There is no RED bonus card available on the board; opponent has reserved L1_39 (RED bonus), but it's not available. So N10 is not imminent. N5 requires RED=4 and BLACK=4; I have BLACK=4, but RED=2, so need two more RED bonuses. That's further away. So N6 is the closest noble. I should buy L1_16 now to get 1 point and attract N6 for 3 points, total 4 points this turn. That would bring my score to 6. Then next turn I can aim for another card. But wait, I have 9 tokens currently. If I purchase L1_16, I will have 7 tokens left, which is fine. However, I must ensure I don't exceed 10 tokens when taking tokens; but I'm not taking tokens now, I'm purchasing. So purchase is valid. I should also consider if there's any risk of returning tokens if I take tokens later; but that's future. So purchasing L1_16 now is the best move. But I need to verify that L1_16 is still available on the board. Yes, it's in the face-up cards under LEVEL_1. So I will purchase L1_16. However, I must be careful: my previous error was attempting to purchase L1_16 without enough tokens. Now I have 2 RED tokens, and after applying bonuses, I need 2 RED tokens, which I have. So it's affordable. Let's double-check: L1_16 cost: RED=4. My RED bonus=2, so I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I have 2 RED tokens. Yes. I also have gold tokens? No. So I can purchase. Therefore, I should set action_type to PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_16.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently have 2 points, opponent has 11 points and is close to winning. I need to score points quickly. My best immediate path is to attract noble N6, which requires BLUE=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3. I already have WHITE=3 and BLACK=4, but BLUE=2. L1_16 provides the missing BLUE bonus and costs RED=4. After my RED bonus=2, I need 2 RED tokens. I currently have 1 RED token. I can take tokens to get the second RED token. Available tokens on board: WHITE=3, BLUE=0, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0, GOLD=5. Wait, the board shows availableTokens counts: WHITE=3, all others 0. That's critical: only WHITE tokens are available. I cannot take RED, GREEN, BLACK because they are 0. I must take tokens from available colors. The only color with tokens is WHITE, but there are 3 WHITE tokens. However, to take tokens, I must either take 3 different colors each 1, or 2 of the same color if at least 4 are available. WHITE has only 3, so I cannot take 2 WHITE (since need 4+). Therefore, I cannot take any tokens because there are not three different colors with at least 1 token each. This is a problem. I must consider alternative actions: reserve a card or purchase a card. I should purchase a card if possible. Let's check affordable cards given my tokens and bonuses. My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. Bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. Check each face-up card: L1_32 (GREEN bonus, 1 point, cost BLACK=4). After BLACK bonus=4, cost 0 tokens. I can buy it for free, gaining 1 point and GREEN bonus. L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points, cost BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1). After bonuses: BLUE=2 reduces BLUE cost by 2? Wait, BLUE bonus is 2, but cost includes BLUE=1, so after applying bonus, BLUE cost becomes 0. GREEN bonus=1 reduces GREEN=3 to 2. RED bonus=2 reduces RED=1 to 0. So effective cost is 2 GREEN tokens. I have only 1 GREEN token, so not affordable. L1_16 (BLUE bonus, 1 point, cost RED=4). After RED bonus=2, need 2 RED tokens. I have 2 RED tokens exactly, so I can buy L1_16 now! Wait, I have 2 RED tokens. That's enough. I can purchase L1_16 immediately. This will give me BLUE bonus, increasing BLUE to 3, and 1 point. Then I will have WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=4, which satisfies N6 (requires BLACK=3, WHITE=3, BLUE=3). So at the end of my turn, noble N6 will be attracted, giving me 3 additional points. Total points: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 points. That's a significant jump. I should do this now. I previously thought I needed another RED token, but I actually have 2 RED tokens already. The board shows RED=0, but that's the board supply; I have my own RED tokens. Yes, I have RED=2. So I can purchase L1_16 now. This is the best move. No need to take tokens. Also, purchasing now denies the card to opponent. I will go ahead and purchase L1_16.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I must take tokens to set up for purchasing L1_16 next turn, which gives 1 point and the BLUE bonus I need to attract noble N6 (3 points). My current tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2, total 9. Available tokens on board: WHITE=3, BLUE=0, GREEN=0, RED=0, BLACK=0, GOLD=5. I can only take tokens from colors with at least 1 token on board. Currently, only WHITE has tokens (3). However, I cannot take 3 different colors because BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK are all 0. I could take 2 WHITE tokens if there are at least 4 WHITE tokens? There are only 3 WHITE tokens, so I cannot take 2 of the same color because it requires at least 4 available. Therefore, I cannot take any tokens via the normal TAKE_TOKENS action because there are not enough tokens of different colors. This is a critical situation. I must consider alternative actions: I could purchase a card, reserve a card, or take tokens if possible. Since I cannot take 3 different colors (only WHITE available), and I cannot take 2 WHITE (requires 4+), the only legal token-taking move is to take 1 token? No, the rules require exactly 3 tokens of 3 different colors, or exactly 2 tokens of the same color if 4+ available. Taking 1 token is invalid. Therefore, TAKE_TOKENS is impossible. I must choose another action. I can purchase a card: I have 9 tokens, and I need to avoid exceeding 10. Purchasing a card would reduce my token count. I should buy L1_16 now if I can afford it. L1_16 costs RED=4. My RED bonus is 2, so I need 2 RED tokens. I have exactly 2 RED tokens. So I can purchase L1_16 immediately. This will give me 1 point and increase my BLUE bonus to 3, which will attract noble N6 (since I already have WHITE=3 and BLACK=4). That will give me 3 additional points, bringing my total from 2 to 6. This is the fastest way to gain points. I should do this now. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_32 for 1 point using a BLACK token, but that doesn't attract a noble. L1_16 is clearly better. I will purchase L1_16.

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 11, needing 4 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:0, and my bonuses are WHITE:4, BLUE:3, GREEN:2. I have reserved cards L1_39 and L2_50. After evaluating the board, I can purchase L2_63 immediately, which gives 2 points and increases my green bonus to 3. This is efficient because it directly advances my score and improves my engine. After purchasing L2_63, my score becomes 13, and I can then purchase L2_42 next turn without using green tokens (due to the increased green bonus), gaining 1 point and a black bonus, bringing my score to 14. From there, I will need to acquire one more point, likely by reserving cards to get gold tokens to purchase L2_50 or other opportunities. Taking tokens is not possible this turn because only white tokens are available, and I cannot take three different colors or two of the same color due to supply limits. Purchasing L2_63 is the most point-efficient action now.

======================================================================================

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=6}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 points, opponent has 13 and is close to winning (15 points). I need to score points immediately. My bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. Total tokens: 9. I am at 9 tokens, so if I take 3 tokens, I will exceed 10 and must return tokens. That's inefficient. Better to purchase a card now to reduce tokens and score points. I can afford L1_16 (cost RED=4, after RED bonus=2, need RED=2 tokens). I have exactly RED=2 tokens, so I can purchase L1_16 immediately. This gives 1 point and increases BLUE bonus to 3. With BLUE=3, WHITE=3, BLACK=3, I attract noble N6 for 3 points, totaling 1+3=4 points, bringing my score to 6. That's a significant gain. Alternatively, I could buy L1_32 (cost BLACK=4, after BLACK bonus=4, need BLACK=0, but I also need to pay any remaining cost? Actually, BLACK bonus of 4 covers the BLACK=4 cost entirely, so effective cost is 0 tokens. But L1_32 gives 1 point and GREEN bonus, no noble attraction. That's only 1 point. L1_12 costs BLUE1, GREEN3, RED1; after bonuses: BLUE bonus=2 reduces BLUE1 to 0, GREEN bonus=1 reduces GREEN3 to 2, RED bonus=2 reduces RED1 to 0, so need 2 GREEN tokens. I have 1 GREEN token, not enough. L1_18 costs BLUE1, GREEN2, RED1, BLACK1; after bonuses: BLUE2 covers BLUE1, GREEN1 reduces GREEN2 to 1, RED2 covers RED1, BLACK4 covers BLACK1, so need 1 GREEN token. I have 1 GREEN token, so I could buy L1_18 for 0 points, WHITE bonus, which increases WHITE to 4, not immediately helpful for nobles. So L1_16 is the best: it gives points, triggers noble, and reduces my token count (using 2 RED tokens) from 9 to 7, allowing me to take tokens next turn. I must verify that I have the tokens: RED tokens =2, yes. Purchasing L1_16 is legal. I should do that now.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I must correct my previous illegal move. I attempted to purchase L1_16 but lacked sufficient tokens (only 1 RED token, needed 2). My plan is to take tokens to acquire the second RED token and other useful tokens to enable purchasing L1_16 next turn, which will give me 1 point and the BLUE bonus, triggering noble N6 (3 points) because I already have WHITE=3, BLACK=3, and will have BLUE=3. That yields 4 total points, bringing my score to 6, catching up to opponent's 13. I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2). Available tokens on board: WHITE=3, BLUE=0, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=0, GOLD=5. I cannot take BLUE, RED, or BLACK because they have 0 tokens. However, I can take WHITE and GREEN, but I need exactly 3 different colors. Since only WHITE and GREEN have tokens, I cannot take 3 different colors. Wait, the board shows WHITE=3, GREEN=3, but RED=0, BLACK=0, BLUE=0. So only two colors are available. This means I cannot take 3 different colors. I can only take 2 tokens of the same color if at least 4 are available. WHITE has 3, so I cannot take 2 WHITE. GREEN has 3, so I cannot take 2 GREEN. Therefore, taking tokens is impossible! I must choose another action. I need to purchase a card or reserve. Let's examine affordable cards. My tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2. Bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. L1_32 costs BLACK=4. After BLACK bonus=4, cost is 0 tokens. I can purchase L1_32 for free, gaining 1 point and GREEN bonus. That increases my score to 3 and GREEN bonus to 2. That's immediate points and a bonus, but doesn't trigger a noble. L1_12 costs BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1. After bonuses: BLUE bonus=2 reduces BLUE cost to 0, GREEN bonus=1 reduces GREEN cost to 2, RED bonus=2 reduces RED cost to 0. So I need 2 GREEN tokens. I have only 1 GREEN token, so not affordable. L1_16 costs RED=4. After RED bonus=2, need 2 RED tokens. I have 2 RED tokens exactly, so I can purchase L1_16 now! Wait, I have 2 RED tokens, and the cost after bonuses is RED=2. So I can afford L1_16. Why did I think I needed another RED token? Because earlier I had only 1 RED token. But in the current state, I have RED=2. Let's verify: my tokens according to the state: RED=2. Yes. So I can purchase L1_16 now. That gives 1 point and BLUE bonus, making my BLUE bonus=3. That satisfies noble N6 requirements (WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=3). So at the end of this turn, N6 will visit, giving 3 points. Total points added: 1 (card) + 3 (noble) = 4. My score becomes 2+4=6. That's good. However, note that my opponent has 13 points, dangerously close to 15. I need to move faster. But this is the best immediate point gain. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token, but that doesn't give points. Purchasing L1_32 gives 1 point but no noble. Purchasing L1_16 is better. I should also consider future moves: after buying L1_16, I will have RED=0 tokens left. But I will have attracted N6, and my bonuses will be WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. Next, I can aim for N10 (needs RED=3) or N5 (needs RED=4). I need more RED bonuses. There's a face-up L2_70 (RED bonus, 3 points) but expensive. L2_65 (RED bonus, 1 point) costs WHITE=2, RED=2, BLACK=3. After bonuses: WHITE=3 reduces WHITE cost to 0, RED=2 reduces RED cost to 0, BLACK=4 reduces BLACK cost to 0. So it would be free! But I need to have the tokens to pay upfront before discounts. The cost is WHITE=2, RED=2, BLACK=3. I have WHITE=1, RED=0 after buying L1_16, BLACK=2. So I would need more tokens. So not immediately affordable. But after buying L1_16, I'll have tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=0, BLACK=2. That's 7 tokens total, so I could take tokens next turn to gather WHITE and BLACK to afford L2_65. L2_65 gives 1 point and RED bonus, which would bring my RED bonus to 3, attracting N10 for another 3 points. That's a good path. So purchasing L1_16 now is optimal. I must ensure I set action_type correctly. So action: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id="L1_16".
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I currently have 2 points, opponent has 13 and is close to winning. I need to score points quickly. My path to immediate points is attracting noble N6: I have WHITE=3, BLACK=3, and need BLUE=3 (currently BLUE=2). Purchasing L1_16 gives BLUE bonus and 1 point, and would attract N6 for 3 points, totaling 4 points, bringing me to 6. That's my fastest route. To buy L1_16, I need 2 RED tokens (cost RED4, RED bonus=2). I currently have RED=2 tokens, so I could buy L1_16 now! Wait, check: L1_16 cost RED4. My RED bonus is 2, so I need to pay 2 RED tokens. I have exactly 2 RED tokens. I also have enough other tokens? The card only costs RED, no other colors. So I can purchase L1_16 immediately. That gives me 1 point and BLUE bonus, making BLUE=3. At the end of my turn, I will have WHITE=3, BLUE=3, BLACK=3, so noble N6 will be attracted, giving 3 more points. Total points added: 4. My score becomes 6. Opponent is at 13, still ahead but I'm closer. However, I must consider that after purchasing, I will have 0 RED tokens, and my token count will be 5 (since I spend 2 RED tokens, leaving WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, BLACK=2). That's fine. This is better than taking tokens because I get the points now. Taking tokens would delay by one turn, and opponent might win next turn. So I should purchase L1_16 now. But wait, I need to verify that L1_16 is still face-up. In the current state, L1_16 is in faceUpCards LEVEL_1. So yes, it's available. Therefore, I should purchase L1_16 now.

Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I need to reach 15 prestige points from my current score of 13. The most efficient action this turn is to purchase L2_42 from the board, which gives 1 point. I can afford this card with my current tokens and bonuses: with WHITE bonus 4, the WHITE cost of 3 is reduced to 0; with GREEN bonus 3, the GREEN cost of 3 is reduced to 0; and with no BLACK bonus, the BLACK cost of 2 requires 2 BLACK tokens, which I have. This action increases my score to 14 and gives me a BLACK bonus. After this purchase, I will need only one more point to win. While I have reserved cards like L2_50 that give 2 points, I cannot afford it yet due to insufficient BLACK tokens. However, by reserving cards in future turns to gain gold tokens, I can eventually purchase a card like L2_65 (which gives 1 point) using gold tokens to cover the missing BLACK costs. Purchasing L2_42 now is the best way to gain a point immediately and progress toward 15 points.

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=6}
Reasoning: Opponent has 14 points and can win next turn by purchasing L2_49, which costs WHITE5 and BLUE3. After their bonuses (WHITE=4, BLUE=3), they only need 1 WHITE token, which they can easily take. To block this immediate win, I must deny L2_49. Reserving it removes the card from the board and gives me a gold token. My current token count is 9, and adding a gold token brings me to 10, avoiding the need to return tokens. This delay gives me a chance to purchase points on my next turn while preventing opponent from reaching 15 points now.

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I need one more point to reach 15 prestige points. My plan is to purchase L2_65, which gives 1 point. I have enough RED tokens for it after bonuses, but I need two BLACK tokens. Currently, I have zero BLACK tokens. Since I can only take one BLACK token per turn (because I must take three different colors and only two BLACK tokens are available, preventing me from taking two at once), I need to take one BLACK token this turn to start accumulating. After this turn, I will have one BLACK token, and then on the next turn, I can take another BLACK token, and on the following turn, I can purchase L2_65. Taking one WHITE and one GREEN token this turn does not interfere with this plan and may be useful for other opportunities, but since I am close to winning, it is safe to take these tokens. This action does not exceed the token limit, so no returns are needed.

Turn 29 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=6, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have 10 tokens (WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2, GOLD=1). My bonuses: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=4. I need to score points immediately. Opponent is at 14 points and could win next turn if they can purchase a high-point card. However, I have reserved L2_49, denying them an easy win. Now I must maximize my points this turn to possibly win or get closer. Purchasing L1_16 costs RED=4. After RED bonus=2, I need 2 RED tokens, which I have exactly. This purchase gives me 1 prestige point and a BLUE bonus, increasing my BLUE bonus from 2 to 3. This satisfies the BLUE requirement for noble N6 (requires BLACK=3, WHITE=3, BLUE=3). I already have BLACK=4, WHITE=3, and after this purchase BLUE=3, so N6 will be attracted at the end of my turn, giving me an additional 3 prestige points. My total score will increase from 2 to 6 (2 + 1 + 3). That's a significant jump. Additionally, this reduces my token count by 2 RED tokens, leaving me with 8 tokens, which is below the limit. Alternative purchases: L1_32 costs BLACK=4, after BLACK bonus=4, cost is 0, but it gives only 1 point and a GREEN bonus, no noble attraction. L1_12 costs BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=1; after bonuses: BLUE=2 reduces BLUE1 to 0, GREEN=1 reduces GREEN3 to 2, RED=2 reduces RED1 to 0, so I need 2 GREEN tokens, but I only have 1 GREEN token, so not affordable. L1_18 costs BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1; after bonuses: BLUE=2 reduces BLUE1 to 0, GREEN=1 reduces GREEN2 to 1, RED=2 reduces RED1 to 0, BLACK=4 reduces BLACK1 to 0, so I need 1 GREEN token, which I have, but it gives 0 points and a WHITE bonus (I already have WHITE=3). Not useful. Purchasing L1_16 is clearly the best move for immediate points and noble attraction. I should not take tokens because I'm already at 10 tokens, and taking would require returning tokens, which is inefficient. I could purchase my reserved card L2_49, but it costs WHITE=5, BLUE=3; after bonuses: WHITE=3 reduces WHITE5 to 2, BLUE=2 reduces BLUE3 to 1, so I need 2 WHITE and 1 BLUE tokens, but I have only 1 WHITE and 3 BLUE tokens, so not affordable. Therefore, purchasing L1_16 is optimal.

Reasoning: Opponent is at 14 points and can win immediately by purchasing L2_65 (1 point, cost WHITE2, RED2, BLACK3) since they have exactly the required tokens and bonuses. I must block this. Purchasing L2_65 myself costs 0 tokens after applying my bonuses (WHITE3, RED2, BLACK4), giving me 1 point and increasing my RED bonus to 3. This attracts noble N10 (requires BLACK3, WHITE3, RED3), adding 3 points. Total points gained: 4, bringing my score from 6 to 10. This is the most efficient move to score points and prevent opponent's win.

Turn 30 - Player 1's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I need one more prestige point to reach 15 and win. I can purchase L2_66 from the board, which gives 1 point. After bonuses, the cost requires 2 RED and 2 BLACK tokens, which I have exactly. This action will increase my score to 15 and win the game immediately.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_66]
