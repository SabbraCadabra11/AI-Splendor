Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: This is turn 1, and I need to establish a strong foundation. I'm taking 3 different colored tokens (RED, BLACK, GREEN) to maximize my resources and flexibility. This combination is optimal because: (1) All three colors are required by noble N7, making it a viable long-term goal. (2) RED and BLACK set me up to purchase L1_21 next turn or the turn after, giving me an early WHITE bonus which is highly valuable for Level 2 and 3 cards. (3) GREEN is needed for multiple nobles (N7, N9) and useful for various cards. Available tokens on board confirm all three colors have 4+ tokens available, and I currently have 0 tokens so no returns are needed. This balanced opening keeps multiple strategic paths open.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: At the start of the game, I have no tokens and need to build liquidity to purchase cards. Taking three distinct colors of different types is the optimal opening move to maximize options. I selected WHITE and BLUE because they have the highest supply (4 each) and are required for many cards on the board (e.g., L3_76, L2_51). For the third token, I chose BLACK. This decision is driven by synergy with available Level 1 cards, specifically L1_20, which costs 3 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black. Holding one of each allows me to purchase this card quickly to start generating White bonuses. This approach also puts minor pressure on the opponent's single Black token.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: On turn 2, I need to position myself to purchase L1_21 next turn to get an early WHITE bonus. L1_21 costs RED:2, BLACK:1, and I currently have RED:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and RED gives me: (1) The additional RED token needed to buy L1_21 next turn (will have RED:2), (2) WHITE tokens which are universally valuable for Level 2 and 3 cards, (3) BLUE tokens which open paths to noble N9 and various cards. After this action, I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 (6 total tokens), perfectly positioned to purchase L1_21 on turn 3 for the crucial early WHITE bonus. The board has 3+ of each color available, this is a valid 3-different-color take, and I won't exceed 10 tokens so no returns needed. This maintains strategic flexibility while executing on my plan to secure the easiest available bonus card.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: My current hand (1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Black) puts me within reach of two Level 1 White-bonus cards: L1_20 (needs 2 more White) and L1_21 (needs 2 Red). Since I cannot take 2 tokens of the same color (supply is low), I must take 3 different tokens. I will take 1 White, 1 Red, and 1 Green. Taking White is critical to pursue L1_20 and the high-value Level 3 White cards (L3_76, L3_81). Taking Red sets up L1_21 and acts as a denial against my opponent who already holds 2 Red tokens and could potentially purchase L1_21 immediately. Taking Green supports the available Nobles (N7, N9) and adds diversification. This brings my total to 6 tokens, keeping me flexible for the next turn.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 3: Time to execute on my strategy and purchase L1_21. I currently have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 (6 tokens total). L1_21 costs RED:2, BLACK:1, which I can afford exactly. This purchase gives me: (1) My first WHITE bonus, which is highly valuable for Level 2 and 3 cards like L2_54, L2_41, and the Level 3 options, (2) Reduces my token count from 6 to 3 (keeping WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1), giving me flexibility for future token acquisition, (3) Positions me to purchase more cards efficiently in upcoming turns. The WHITE bonus will reduce effective costs on many valuable cards. This executes perfectly on the plan I established in turns 1-2, and I'm now securing my first bonus card efficiently.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card this turn. L1_20 (White bonus) costs 3 White, 1 Blue, 1 Black; I have 2 White, 1 Blue, 1 Black and need exactly 1 more White. L1_37 (Red bonus) costs 2 Blue, 1 Green; I have 1 Blue, 1 Green and need 1 more Blue. Prioritizing L1_20 is better because a White bonus synergizes with the high-value Level 3 cards on the board (L3_76, L3_78, L3_81 all require White). Since the board only has 1 White token available, I must take it along with two other distinct tokens. I choose Red and Black as the other two tokens: they have high supply (3 each), they support the Nobles N5 and N7 (which opponent is not close to), and they deny resources the opponent currently lacks (0 Red, 0 Black). Taking these three brings my total to 9 tokens, staying under the 10-token limit.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: Turn 4: I need to catch up on tokens - I have 3 while my opponent has 9. Taking BLUE, GREEN, and RED accomplishes multiple goals: (1) BLUE:2 total enables purchasing L1_37 next turn for my first RED bonus, (2) GREEN:2 positions me well for nobles N7 and N9 which both require GREEN:3, (3) RED:1 is needed for those same nobles and many valuable cards. All three colors have 2+ tokens available on the board. After this move I'll have 6 tokens total, perfectly positioned to buy L1_37 next turn using BLUE:2, GREEN:1. The RED bonus from L1_37 will then make Level 2 cards like L2_54 and L2_59 much more affordable. This maintains strong board position while executing my engine-building strategy efficiently.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can afford L1_20 (3 White, 1 Blue, 1 Black) with my current tokens (3 White, 1 Blue, 2 Black). Purchasing this card is the optimal move for several reasons: 1) It acquires my first permanent bonus (White), which is essential for the high-value Level 3 cards on the board (L3_76, L3_78, L3_81) that heavily require White. 2) It prevents the opponent, who already has a White bonus, from easily acquiring a second low-cost White card. 3) It efficiently reduces my token count from 9 to 4, avoiding the need to waste a turn returning tokens or managing the 10-token limit. 4) Securing a White bonus puts me on a direct path to scoring points via the expensive Level 3 cards.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: Turn 5: After careful analysis, I'm pivoting from my original plan to buy L1_37. While getting a RED bonus would be valuable long-term, I've identified a faster path to prestige points. By taking WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 this turn, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 (9 tokens total). This perfectly positions me to purchase L2_41 next turn, which costs WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2 (effective WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2 with my WHITE bonus). L2_41 gives me: (1) My first prestige point (crucial for the race to 15), (2) A BLACK bonus, which is extremely valuable - it saves 6 tokens on L3_81 and is needed for nobles N5 and N7, (3) Gets me to Level 2 cards one turn faster than buying L1_37 then taking tokens. BLACK bonus is strategically stronger than RED bonus for high-value plays. All three colors are available on board (WHITE:3, RED:1, BLACK:3), I'm at 6 tokens so won't exceed the 10 limit, and this is a valid 3-different-colors take. This is the optimal path to scoring.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: Turn 5: I made an error last turn trying to take tokens. Looking at my current state more carefully, I have BLUE:2, GREEN:2 and L1_37 costs exactly BLUE:2, GREEN:1. I can purchase it RIGHT NOW! This is far better than taking tokens because: (1) I immediately get my second bonus (RED), which reduces effective costs on valuable Level 2 cards like L2_54 (RED:3→2 with bonus) and L2_59 (RED:3→2 with bonus), (2) I reduce my token count from 6 to 3 (keeping WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1), maintaining flexibility, (3) With WHITE:1 and RED:1 bonuses, I'm strongly positioned for Level 2 purchases. L1_37 is confirmed on the board in LEVEL_1 face-up cards. This executes my engine-building strategy perfectly and gets me the RED bonus I was planning for.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: My current tokens (1 Green, 2 Red, 1 Black) and bonuses (1 White) are not sufficient to purchase any available card immediately. My long-term strategy should focus on the high-value Level 3 cards on the board (L3_76, L3_78), which provide Blue bonuses and have high White costs. Since I already have a White bonus, acquiring a Blue bonus is the highest priority to unlock these cards. The most efficient path to a Blue bonus is L1_15 (costs 3 Black). I currently have 1 Black token. Taking 2 Black tokens this turn (allowed as there are 3 available) will bring my total to 3 Black, allowing me to purchase L1_15 on the next turn. This move also strongly denies the opponent Black tokens, which are critical for the available Nobles (N5, N7) that the opponent might be eyeing.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLACK tokens: only 3 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I am focusing on acquiring a Blue bonus to access the high-value Blue cards on the board (L3_76, L3_78) and L2_51. The cheapest Blue card is L1_15 (cost 3 Blue). Currently, I have 0 Blue tokens. The board has 4 Blue tokens available, allowing me to take 2. Taking 2 Blue is the most efficient way to start this engine, as it significantly depletes the Blue pool (denying the opponent who has 0 Blue tokens) and puts me within one turn of purchasing L1_15. My other tokens (1 Green, 2 Red, 1 Black) are sufficient to hold me over until I secure the Blue bonus. This move increases my total tokens to 6, staying safely under the 10-token limit.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: Turn 6: I need to transition from engine-building to scoring points. My analysis shows that my opponent can likely purchase L1_2 on their turn (they have the exact tokens needed: BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2 with their WHITE bonus covering the WHITE:1 cost). L1_40 is the most achievable point-scoring card for me - it costs WHITE:4 (effective WHITE:3 with my bonus) and gives 1 point plus a second RED bonus. I currently have WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (3 tokens). Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 positions me optimally because: (1) WHITE:1 brings me to WHITE:2, just 1 token away from buying L1_40 next turn or the turn after, (2) BLUE:1 provides flexibility for Level 2 cards like L2_54 and L2_41, which are future targets, (3) BLACK:1 keeps options open for L1_15 and builds toward noble requirements. This is a valid 3-different-color take (board has WHITE:3, BLUE:2, BLACK:3 available). After this move I'll have 6 tokens total, staying well under the 10-token limit. This aggressive point-scoring approach is critical - I have strong bonuses (WHITE:1, RED:1) but 0 points, so I must start converting my engine into prestige. The RED:2 bonus from L1_40 will be highly valuable for expensive Level 2 cards and long-term noble pursuits.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I analyzed the board and my current hand (0 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, 2 Red, 1 Black tokens, plus 1 White bonus). I discovered that I can immediately purchase L1_2, which costs 1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. My 1 White bonus covers the White cost, and my tokens cover the rest (2 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red). Purchasing this card is optimal because: 1) It secures a Black bonus, which synergizes with the available Nobles (N5, N7) and facilitates future purchases like L1_15 (Blue bonus) by effectively reducing its cost. 2) It drastically reduces my token count from 6 to 2, avoiding token management issues and freeing up space for new liquidity. 3) It adds a second permanent bonus to my engine, putting me ahead of the opponent who only has one bonus. 4) It clears my Blue tokens, which were accumulating without a clear path to a Blue card, resetting my strategy to build towards high-value cards using White and Black discounts.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 7: I'm executing on my plan to purchase L1_40 for my first point and a crucial RED:2 total bonus (L1_40 gives RED bonus, adding to my existing RED:1 from L1_37). I currently have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 (6 tokens total). L1_40 costs WHITE:4, which with my WHITE:1 bonus becomes WHITE:3 effective cost. Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 this turn accomplishes: (1) Gives me the WHITE:3 tokens needed to purchase L1_40 next turn, (2) BLUE:1 positions me well for Level 2 cards like L2_54 and L2_41, (3) GREEN:1 builds toward nobles N7 and N9 which both require GREEN:3 in bonuses. After this action I'll have WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 (9 tokens), perfectly positioned to purchase L1_40 next turn. The board has WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:3 available, making this a valid 3-different-color take. Next turn I'll secure my first point and RED:2 total bonus, dramatically improving my position for Level 2 purchases. I considered purchasing L1_10 this turn for a BLUE:1 bonus, but that would delay my first point by an extra turn, and the RED:2 from L1_40 is more valuable strategically. This maintains my aggressive point-scoring approach while building the engine I need for mid-game dominance.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card this turn. My strategic focus is acquiring a Blue bonus to unlock the high-value Level 3 cards (L3_76, L3_78) on the board. The best path to a Blue bonus is L1_15, which costs 3 Black tokens. I currently have 1 Black bonus and 1 Black token, so I need exactly 1 more Black token. Since I cannot take 2 Black tokens (board supply is only 2, and rules require 4+ to take a double), I must take 3 distinct tokens including 1 Black. For the other two tokens, I select White and Green: White is scarce (only 1 left) and essential for the expensive White/Blue cards; Green supports the available Nobles (N7, N9) and provides liquidity. Taking these three brings my total to 5 tokens and guarantees the purchase of L1_15 next turn, securing my third bonus.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can now afford L1_40, which has been my target for the past 3 turns. With WHITE:3 tokens and my WHITE:1 bonus, I can cover the WHITE:4 cost. This purchase accomplishes three critical goals: (1) I score my first prestige point, (2) I gain a RED bonus, bringing my total to RED:2, which significantly reduces costs on valuable cards like L2_54 (RED:3→1 effective), L2_59 (RED:3→1 effective), and Level 3 cards like L3_81 and L3_89, (3) I reduce my token count from 9 to 6, staying well under the 10-token limit while maintaining flexibility. The RED:2 bonus is strategically superior to taking L2_41 (BLACK bonus) because RED costs appear more frequently on high-value cards, and RED:2 helps me progress toward nobles N7 and N9, which both require RED:3. The board currently has WHITE:0 tokens available, confirming I cannot take WHITE tokens to accumulate more. This executes on my established 3-turn strategy perfectly and positions me strongly for Level 2 purchases in upcoming turns.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I can afford L1_15 (Blue bonus, cost 3 Black) immediately using my 1 Black bonus and 2 Black tokens. This purchase is the optimal move because: 1) It secures a third distinct bonus (Blue), which is critical for affording the high-value Level 3 cards on the board (L3_76, L3_78) and differentiating my engine from the opponent who has 0 Blue. 2) It efficiently spends my accumulated Black tokens, reducing my total token count from 5 to 3, preventing potential return-waste scenarios in future turns. 3) Securing Blue now sets me up to potentially contest Noble N9 or pivot to the heavy Blue/White end-game cards.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_54 (1 point, WHITE bonus) next turn if I position correctly. L2_54 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3, but with my WHITE:1 and RED:2 bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:3, RED:1. I currently have WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 (6 tokens). Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 gives me exactly what I need: WHITE:1✓, BLUE:3✓, RED:1✓, positioning me to purchase L2_54 next turn. This is far superior to purchasing L1_10 or L1_4 right now (both 0 points), as it keeps me in scoring mode. GREEN:1 is the optimal third color because nobles N7 and N9 both require GREEN:3 bonuses, and the board only has GREEN:1 left. After this move I'll have 9 tokens total. Next turn I purchase L2_54 for my second point and a second WHITE bonus, extending my lead to 2-0.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold 4 tokens (1 White, 1 Green, 1 Red, 1 Black) and possess 3 bonuses (White, Blue, Black). My immediate goal is to build liquidity to afford the high-value Level 3 cards (L3_76, L3_78) which cost significant White/Blue resources. The board shows Green is empty (0), so I cannot target cards needing Green this turn. I need to accumulate White and Blue to reach the 6+ White/Blue cost required for the top-tier cards. I will take 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Red. Taking White and Blue is critical as they are the keys to the 4 and 5-point cards on the board. There is only 1 Blue token available; taking it secures that scarce resource for my engine. Taking Red provides flexible liquidity. This brings my total tokens to 7 (1W, 1B, 1G, 2R, 1B, 1G), keeping me safely under the 10-token limit.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have positioned myself perfectly to purchase L2_54 this turn, exactly as I planned last turn. L2_54 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:3, RED:3, and with my WHITE:1 and RED:2 bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:3, RED:1. I currently have exactly these tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:3, RED:1 (plus GREEN:3, BLACK:1). This purchase accomplishes three strategic goals: (1) I score my second prestige point, extending my lead to 2-0 against an opponent who cannot purchase any Level 2 cards this turn, (2) I gain a WHITE bonus, bringing my total to WHITE:2, which opens up future purchases like L2_59 (WHITE:3→1 effective cost), L3_76 (WHITE:7→5 effective), and L3_78 (WHITE:7→5 effective), (3) I reduce my token count from 9 to 4, creating room for future token-taking actions. The WHITE:2 bonus is particularly valuable for expensive Level 3 cards worth 4-5 prestige points. After this purchase, my bonuses will be WHITE:2, RED:2, making me highly efficient at purchasing expensive cards. This is the optimal continuation of my scoring strategy - I maintain momentum while my opponent remains at 0 points.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: My current focus is accumulating resources to purchase high-value Level 2 or Level 3 cards that provide prestige points. I have 6 tokens and 0 points. Buying L1_10 (0 points) would leave me with only 1 token, stalling my economy. Instead, I will build liquidity to target L2_60 (1 point) or higher cards next turn. Taking 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black allows me to reach a total of 9 tokens while positioning myself to afford L2_60 (cost 2W, 3B, 2Bk - I will have 3W, 2B, 1Bk plus bonuses covering the rest) or L3_76/L3_78 in the near future. White and Blue are essential for my Level 3 targets, and Black synergizes with my Black bonus and the available Nobles (N5, N7).

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 2 points with WHITE:2 and RED:2 bonuses, positioning to score my third point next turn. L2_59 (1 point, GREEN bonus) costs WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, but with my bonuses the effective cost is WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1. Currently I have WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, RED:0, BLACK:1 (4 tokens). Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1 this turn gives me exactly what I need for L2_59 next turn: WHITE:1✓, GREEN:2✓ (from my existing 3), RED:1✓. After taking these tokens I'll have 7 tokens total (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1), safely under the 10-token limit. The BLUE:1 also positions me for future high-value cards like L3_78 (5 points, needs WHITE:5 and BLUE:3). Board has WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:2 available, making this a valid 3-different-color take. My opponent at 0 points with 9 tokens will likely buy L2_60 (1 point) this turn, but I'll maintain my lead at 3-1 after purchasing L2_59 next turn. This maintains my aggressive scoring strategy while building toward Level 3 cards.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can afford L2_60 (Cost 2W, 3B, 2Bk). With my current bonuses (1W, 1B, 1Bk), the effective cost is reduced to 1W, 2B, 1Bk. I hold 3 White, 2 Blue, and 1 Black token, so I can pay exactly 1W, 2B, 1Bk. This purchase grants 1 prestige point (bringing my total to 1) and a Green bonus. Acquiring a Green bonus is crucial because Green tokens are currently depleted (0) on the board, effectively locking other players out of Green costs unless they have a bonus. This diversifies my engine to four distinct bonus colors (White, Blue, Black, Green), which is superior for meeting Noble conditions and future card costs compared to stacking a duplicate Blue bonus. Additionally, purchasing this card reduces my token count from 9 to 5, removing the risk of exceeding the 10-token limit and allowing me to take 3 fresh tokens next turn without waste.

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_59 exactly as planned last turn. L2_59 costs WHITE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, but with my WHITE:2 and RED:2 bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1. I currently have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1 (7 tokens), which exactly covers the effective cost: WHITE:1✓, GREEN:2✓ (from my 3), RED:1✓. This purchase accomplishes three critical goals: (1) I score my third prestige point, extending my lead to 3-1, (2) I gain a GREEN bonus, bringing my total to WHITE:2, RED:2, GREEN:1, which positions me toward nobles N7 (needs BLACK:3, RED:3, GREEN:3) and N9 (needs BLUE:3, RED:3, GREEN:3), (3) I reduce my token count from 7 to 3, maintaining excellent flexibility. After this purchase I'll have WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1 (3 tokens), positioning me to take tokens next turn for expensive Level 3 cards like L3_78 (5 points, needs WHITE:5+BLUE:3 effective) or L3_76 (4 points, needs WHITE:5 effective). This executes my planned strategy perfectly and maintains aggressive scoring momentum while my opponent at 1 point will struggle to catch up.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: My objective is to reach 3 prestige points to tie my opponent. I have identified L2_61 (2 points) as the most efficient card to achieve this. It costs 4 White, 2 Blue, and 1 Black. With my current bonuses (1W, 1B, 1Bk), I need to acquire 1 additional White token and 1 additional Blue token to afford it on my next turn. I also choose to take 1 Black token to build liquidity for potential Noble claims (N5, N7 require Black) and future high-cost cards, as my opponent lacks a Black bonus and cannot easily utilize Black tokens. This move brings my token count to 8, keeping me safely under the 10-token limit while perfectly positioning me to purchase the 2-point card next turn.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 3 points with WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2 bonuses and only 3 tokens. My opponent at 1 point with 8 tokens can purchase L2_61 (2 points) this turn to tie me at 3-3. I need to maintain scoring momentum. I've identified L2_41 (1 point, BLACK bonus) as my next purchase target - it costs WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, but with my WHITE:2 and GREEN:1 bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1. I currently have WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1. I need WHITE:1 and BLUE:1 more to purchase L2_41 next turn. Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1 this turn positions me perfectly: after taking, I'll have WHITE:1✓, BLUE:2✓, GREEN:1✓ (6 tokens total). Next turn I purchase L2_41 to reach 4 points and gain a BLACK bonus, putting me at 4-3 lead. Taking RED:1 as the third token is optimal because it maintains token diversity after L2_41 purchase (I'll have RED:1, BLACK:1 remaining = 2 tokens), giving me flexibility for future Level 3 purchases like L3_81 or L3_78. Board has WHITE:1, BLUE:2, RED:2 available, making this a valid 3-different-color take. My token count after taking will be 6, safely under the 10-token limit.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am analyzing my current situation. I have 8 tokens (3W, 1B, 1G, 2R, 1Bk) and 1 prestige point. My bonuses are W:1, B:1, G:1, Bk:1. My primary target, as planned in the previous turn, is L2_61 (2 points, Green bonus). It costs 4W, 2B, 1Bk. With my bonuses (1W, 1B, 1Bk), the effective cost is 3W, 1B. Checking my token inventory: I have 3 White and 1 Blue. This matches the effective cost exactly. I can purchase L2_61 immediately. Consequences of Purchase: 1) Score: I gain 2 prestige points, bringing my total to 3. This ties me with the opponent. 2) Bonus: I gain a Green bonus. This upgrades my Green count to 2. 3) Tokens Spent: I spend 3 White and 1 Blue. My remaining tokens will be: 0W, 0B, 1G, 2R, 1Bk (Total: 4). 4) Strategic Positioning: Holding only 4 tokens after purchase gives me immense flexibility next turn. I can take up to 3 distinct tokens or a pair without hitting the limit. I also set myself up for Nobles. With this purchase, my bonuses will be W:1, B:1, G:2, Bk:1. I am close to N7 (needs 3B, 3R, 3G) and N9 (needs 3B, 3R, 3G). Having 2 Green is strong. Buying L2_61 is the definitive power move to secure points and maintain token efficiency.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_41 (1 point, BLACK bonus) this turn as planned! L2_41 costs WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, but with my WHITE:2 and GREEN:1 bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:1. I currently have exactly these tokens: WHITE:1✓, BLUE:2✓, GREEN:1✓ (plus RED:1, BLACK:1), which perfectly covers the cost. This purchase achieves three strategic goals: (1) I score my 4th prestige point, taking the lead 4-3 (my opponent tied me at 3-3 last turn), (2) I gain a BLACK bonus, bringing my total to WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, which moves me closer to noble N7 (needs BLACK:3, RED:3, GREEN:3 - I'd have RED:2/3, BLACK:1/3, GREEN:1/3), (3) I reduce my token count from 6 to 2 (RED:1, BLACK:1 remaining), maximizing flexibility for future token accumulation. After this purchase, my next targets are L2_68 (2 points, needs WHITE:1+BLACK:4 effective) or working toward Level 3 cards like L3_76 (4 points, needs WHITE:5 effective) or L3_81 (4 points, needs WHITE:1+RED:1+BLACK:5 effective). My opponent at 3 points with only 4 tokens cannot purchase high-value cards this turn, so I maintain momentum and extend my lead to 4-3.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am currently at 3 points, trailing the opponent who has 4. I have 4 tokens (1 Green, 2 Red, 1 Black) and cannot afford any of the high-value cards on the board this turn. My strategy is to build liquidity for the Level 3 cards (specifically L3_76 and L3_78) while disrupting my opponent's Noble and development options. The opponent possesses 2 White bonuses, making them the primary competitor for the White-heavy Level 3 cards; therefore, I must take White tokens to remain competitive. Additionally, the opponent requires Black tokens to secure Nobles N5 and N7 (they have 1 Black bonus), and there are only 2 Black tokens on the board. Taking a Black token significantly hinders their progress. Finally, Blue is required for the highest value card (L3_78) and Noble N9. Taking 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black optimizes my resource density for future turns and applies maximum strategic pressure.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 4 points with only 2 tokens (RED:1, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. My opponent will buy L2_65 (1 pt) this turn to tie at 4-4, leaving them with 2 tokens and a strong GREEN:3 bonus. I need to position for a high-value Level 3 purchase to pull ahead. My best target is L3_81 (4 pts, WHITE bonus): base cost is WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:6, but with my bonuses, the effective cost is WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:5. Currently I have RED:1 and BLACK:1 tokens. Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 this turn gives me exactly what I need: WHITE:1✓, BLUE:1, RED:1✓, BLACK:2 (total 5 tokens). After this move, for L3_81 I'll have WHITE:1✓, RED:1✓, and BLACK:2 of the 5 needed - only 3 more BLACK tokens required! Board has WHITE:3, BLUE:3, BLACK:1 available, making this a valid 3-different-color take. The BLUE token also keeps L3_78 (5 pts) as a backup option. This is superior to buying L1_10 (0 pts, BLUE bonus) because taking tokens advances me 2/5 of the way toward L3_81 immediately, while buying L1_10 only saves 1 token on future BLUE purchases. Next turn I'll take tokens including BLACK to get closer to L3_81, potentially purchasing it 2 turns from now to reach 8 points.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am currently at 3 prestige points, trailing my opponent who has 4. I need to secure points immediately to prevent the gap from widening. After evaluating the board, L2_65 is the only affordable card that provides prestige points. Its cost is 2 White, 2 Red, and 3 Black. With my current bonuses (1 White, 1 Black), the effective cost is reduced to 1 White, 2 Red, and 2 Black. My current token inventory (1 White, 2 Red, 2 Black) covers this exactly. Purchasing this card brings my total to 4 points, tying the opponent, and provides a Red bonus. This Red bonus is crucial for positioning myself towards Noble N7 and N9, as well as affording high-value Level 3 cards like L3_89. This move reduces my token count from 7 to 2, keeping me flexible for future turns.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I'm tied 4-4 with my opponent. Buying L1_4 for RED:1 (effective cost with my bonuses) gives me a second BLACK bonus (total BLACK:2), which is the KEY to unlocking L3_81. Let me verify: L1_4 costs GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1. With my bonuses (GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1), the effective cost is RED:1 which I have. After this purchase, my bonuses become WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. Now for L3_81 (4 pts, cost WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:6), the effective cost becomes WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:4 instead of WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:5. I'll have WHITE:1 (have it), RED:0 (need 1), BLACK:2 (need 2 more). That's only 3 tokens needed total! Board has BLACK:2 available - perfect. Next turn I take RED:1, BLACK:1, +one other. Turn after I take BLACK:1 +two others. Then I purchase L3_81 for 8 points total (4+4), taking the lead. This is faster than L2_68 path (which only gets me to 6 points), and the WHITE bonus from L3_81 sets up future L3_76 or L3_78 purchases. Buying this 0-point card now accelerates my path to 8 points by making L3_81 affordable in just 3 turns.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am currently tied with my opponent at 4 prestige points. I cannot afford any face-up card this turn that provides prestige points. My strategy is to target L1_8 (1 point, Black bonus) which costs 4 Blue. With my 1 Blue bonus, the effective cost is 3 Blue tokens. I currently hold 1 Blue token. By taking the 2 available Blue tokens from the board, I will have 3 Blue tokens, allowing me to purchase L1_8 on my next turn to take the lead in points (5 vs 4). Additionally, taking both Blue tokens denies my opponent the liquidity needed to pursue Blue-heavy cards like L3_78 or L2_51, forcing them to pivot. Acquiring the Black bonus from L1_8 is also valuable as Black is a scarce resource (only 2 tokens available) and is required for Nobles N5 and N7.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLUE tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I am currently tied with the opponent at 4 prestige points. My token inventory is low (1 Blue, 1 Green), so I need to build liquidity to purchase Level 3 cards. The Level 3 cards available (L3_76, L3_78, L3_89) require significant investment in White, Blue, or Red/Black. My opponent has strong bonuses in White, Red, and Black, and is low on Blue. To remain competitive and apply pressure, I will diversify my token holdings. Taking 1 White, 1 Red, and 1 Black gives me one of every color (except Green, which I have a bonus for). This spread prepares me for potential purchases of L2_46 (Black), L2_70 (Red), or the White-heavy Level 3 cards, while simultaneously denying the opponent a Black token (they need 4 more for L2_46 or Nobles) and a White token (they are leading the race for White-heavy cards). This move keeps my total tokens at 5, well under the 10-token limit, and maximizes my strategic options for the next turn.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I need to take RED:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1 this turn to position for buying L2_68 next turn. Here's my analysis: (1) L2_68 costs WHITE:3, BLACK:5, but with my bonuses (WHITE:2, BLACK:2), the effective cost is WHITE:1, BLACK:3. (2) I currently have WHITE:1, BLACK:2, so I need BLACK:1 more. (3) The board has BLACK:1 available – this is a scarce resource I must secure NOW. (4) After taking RED:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1, I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 (7 tokens total), which exactly meets L2_68's requirements. (5) Next turn I buy L2_68 for 2 points (reaching 6 total) AND gain RED:3 bonus. (6) With RED:3 bonus, L3_81 (4 pts) becomes much more affordable: effective cost drops to WHITE:1, RED:0, BLACK:4 instead of WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:4. (7) This path gives me concrete scoring progress (6 pts by turn 18) while positioning for L3_81 (10 pts by turn 21). The alternative of buying a 0-point card like L1_34 now doesn't score points, and waiting risks losing the scarce BLACK token. Taking RED:1 also helps since RED:3 are available and I'll need it later. All three colors are available on the board, making this a valid 3-different-color take, and my token count stays at 7 (under the 10 limit).

Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am currently tied with the opponent at 4 prestige points. I cannot afford any available cards this turn, so I must build liquidity. The Level 3 cards L3_76 and L3_78 offer the highest points (4 and 5), but both require 7 White tokens. I have 1 White bonus and 1 token, requiring 5 more. Taking 1 White token is essential to progress towards these. Additionally, taking 1 Blue and 1 Red provides flexibility for other high-value cards like L3_89 and Nobles N7/N9. Taking these specific colors also denies the opponent resources they lack (Blue/White for Nobles and Red for L2_70), applying passive pressure. My token count will be 8, safely under the limit.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I can buy L2_68 (2 points, RED bonus) this turn! L2_68 costs WHITE:3, BLACK:5, but with my bonuses (WHITE:2, BLACK:2), the effective cost is WHITE:1, BLACK:3. I currently have exactly these tokens: WHITE:1✓, BLACK:3✓. This purchase achieves three critical goals: (1) I score 2 points immediately, extending my lead from 4-4 to 6-4. (2) I gain a RED bonus, bringing my total to RED:3, which is HUGE because it makes L3_81 (4 points) much more affordable - the effective cost drops from WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:4 to WHITE:1, RED:0, BLACK:4. (3) I reduce my token count from 7 to 3 (BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 remaining), giving me flexibility to accumulate tokens toward L3_81. My opponent at 4 points with 8 tokens cannot buy any high-value cards this turn - they lack the tokens for L2_51 (need BLUE:4 effective), L2_46 (need BLACK:5 effective), or any Level 3 cards. After this purchase, my path to 15 points is clear: accumulate tokens (using gold if needed for BLACK) to buy L3_81 (reaching 10 points), then pursue nobles or additional Level 3 cards. Board has BLACK:0, but there are 5 gold tokens available that can substitute. This is the correct execution of my turn 17 plan - I took RED:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1 last turn (securing the last BLACK token from the board), and now I buy L2_68 as intended.

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 8 tokens and cannot afford any card that gives points this turn. My opponent needs 2 Green bonuses to secure Noble N7, and only 2 Green tokens are available on the board. By taking 2 Green tokens, I completely deplete the Green supply, effectively blocking my opponent from completing Noble N7 in the near future. This move also sets me up to purchase L2_43 (2 points, Black bonus) on my next turn. L2_43 costs 1 Blue, 4 Green, 2 Red. With my current bonuses (1 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Red), the effective cost is 2 Green and 1 Red. Adding 2 Green tokens to my inventory (bringing my total Green tokens to 3) allows me to cover this cost exactly next turn. Taking 2 tokens keeps my total at 10, avoiding the need to return tokens and maintaining maximum efficiency.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 GREEN tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: I currently have 4 points and 8 tokens. My current bonuses and token totals fully satisfy Noble N9 (needs 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Green; I have 1B+2t, 1R+2t, 2G+1t). This grants me 3 points immediately, bringing my total to 7 and taking the lead. My opponent is close to securing Noble N7 (needs 3 Black, 3 Red, 3 Green). I have 1 Black bonus and 1 Black token (2 total), so I am 1 short. L1_6 is available, costs 1 White token (I have 2), and provides a Black bonus. Purchasing L1_6 upgrades my Black total to 3 (2 bonus + 1 token), fully satisfying Noble N7 as well for my next turn. This move secures my current Noble eligibility and sets up a double Noble swing, effectively denying the opponent a major source of points while maximizing my own score with minimal token cost.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 6 points, opponent at 4 points. My goal is to buy L3_81 (4 points, WHITE bonus) which effectively costs WHITE:1, BLACK:4 (with my bonuses WHITE:2, RED:3, BLACK:2). I currently have 3 tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. While I could buy L1_10 for free (it costs 0 tokens with my bonuses), gaining a BLUE bonus, this would delay my token accumulation by one turn without significantly helping toward L3_81. Instead, I'll take WHITE:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1 to directly progress toward L3_81's requirements. After this move, I'll have 6 tokens: WHITE:1✓ (meeting L3_81's WHITE requirement), BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1. I'll still need BLACK:3 more for L3_81. Board has WHITE:3✓, BLACK:3✓, GREEN:2✓ available, making this a valid 3-different-color token take. Next turn I'll take BLACK:2 (same-color take) plus another token, getting me to BLACK:3 total. The turn after, I can accumulate the final BLACK token or use gold tokens to substitute, then purchase L3_81 for 10 points total. This path reaches 10 points in approximately 2-3 turns, faster than pursuing nobles or other Level 3 cards.

Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 4 prestige points. My bonuses are White:1, Blue:1, Green:2, Red:1, Black:2. My tokens are White:1, Blue:2, Green:1, Red:2, Black:1. I satisfy Noble N7 (3 Black, 3 Red, 3 Green) and Noble N9 (3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Green) with my current holdings. I need to purchase a card to trigger the visit and claim these 6 points. Looking at the board, L1_25 is available for 0 effective cost (Cost: 1W, 1B, 1R, 1Bl; my bonuses cover all). Purchasing this 'free' card is the most efficient move, adding a Green bonus and triggering the Noble visit without spending any tokens. This brings my score to 10, taking a significant lead over the opponent's 6, and preserves my liquidity for future high-level purchases.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I'm at 6 points, opponent at 4 points. I've discovered an EXCELLENT intermediate target: L2_43 (2 points, BLACK bonus). Let me verify: L2_43 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:2. With my bonuses (WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:2), the effective cost is BLUE:1, GREEN:3 (RED covered by RED:3 bonus). I currently have BLUE:1✓, GREEN:2, so I need GREEN:1 more. Taking BLACK:1, WHITE:1, GREEN:1 gives me exactly what I need. After this move: WHITE:2, BLUE:1✓, GREEN:3✓, RED:1, BLACK:2 (9 tokens, under limit). Next turn I buy L2_43 for 2 points, reaching 8 points! The BLACK bonus from L2_43 is CRITICAL: it raises my BLACK bonus from 2 to 3, making L3_81's effective cost drop from WHITE:1, BLACK:4 to WHITE:1, BLACK:3 - one fewer BLACK token needed! Taking BLACK:1 now secures a scarce resource (board has only BLACK:2). This path (take tokens → buy L2_43 for 8 pts → buy L3_81 for 12 pts) is superior to buying L1_10 for free because it scores 2 points immediately while positioning for L3_81. Board has WHITE:2✓, GREEN:1✓, BLACK:2✓ available - valid 3-different-color take.

Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 4 prestige points. My bonuses are White:1, Blue:1, Green:2, Red:1, Black:2. My tokens are White:1, Blue:2, Green:1, Red:2, Black:1. I satisfy Noble N7 (3 Black, 3 Red, 3 Green) and Noble N9 (3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Green) with my current holdings. I need to purchase a card to trigger the visit and claim these 6 points. Looking at the board, L1_25 is available for 0 effective cost (Cost: 1W, 1B, 1R, 1Bl; my bonuses cover all). Purchasing this 'free' card is the most efficient move, adding a Green bonus and triggering the Noble visit without spending any tokens.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card L1_25 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I am currently at 4 prestige points, trailing the opponent who has 6. My previous reasoning incorrectly assumed I satisfied the nobles; I lack the necessary Red and Blue bonuses. I need to score points immediately to stay competitive. Card L2_43 (Level 2, Black bonus, 2 prestige points) is affordable. Its cost is 1 Blue, 4 Green, and 2 Red. With my bonuses (1 Blue, 3 Green, 1 Red), the effective cost is 0 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. My current tokens (1 White, 2 Blue, 1 Green, 2 Red, 1 Black) cover this exactly. Purchasing L2_43 brings my score to 6, tying the opponent, and increases my Black bonus to 3. This positions me closer to Noble N5 (needs 4 Red/Black) and Noble N7 (needs 3 Black/Red/Green), while efficiently utilizing my Green tokens.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I'm tied 6-6 with my opponent. My goal is to buy L3_81 (4 points, WHITE bonus) to reach 10 points. L3_81 effectively costs WHITE:1, BLACK:4 (with my bonuses WHITE:2, RED:3, BLACK:2). I currently have WHITE:2✓, BLACK:2, so I need BLACK:2 more. This turn, I'll take BLACK:1, WHITE:1, RED:1, converting less-useful tokens (BLUE:1, GREEN:2) into tokens needed for L3_81. After this move, I'll have WHITE:3, BLACK:3, RED:2, GREEN:1, BLUE:0 (9 tokens). Next turn, I'll reserve a card to get a gold token, reaching BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (10 tokens). Turn 23, I'll buy L3_81 using WHITE:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1, reaching 10 points. This 2-turn path to 10 points is faster than buying L1_10 for free (0 points, BLUE bonus), which would delay my L3_81 purchase by an extra turn without scoring points. Board has WHITE:1✓, RED:2✓, BLACK:1✓ available, making this a valid 3-different-color take.

Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: My current score is 6, tied with the opponent. I cannot afford any high-point cards directly, but I can trigger a Noble visit. By purchasing L1_34 (Cost: 1 White token effectively, thanks to my bonuses), I gain a Red bonus. This brings my Red total to 3 (2 bonus + 1 token), satisfying Noble N7 (requires 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Black) alongside my existing 3 Green and 4 Black (3 bonus + 1 token) bonuses. Claiming Noble N7 gives me 3 prestige points, increasing my total to 9. This move secures a significant lead over the opponent's 6, denies them a path to a noble (as they were close to satisfying N7 as well), and efficiently utilizes my low White token count without compromising my token economy for future turns.

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=5}
Reasoning: I'm tied 6-6 with my opponent. My goal is to buy L3_81 (4 points, WHITE bonus) to reach 10 points and break the tie. L3_81 costs WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:6. With my bonuses (WHITE:2, RED:3, BLACK:2), the effective cost is WHITE:1, RED:0, BLACK:4. I currently have WHITE:3✓, BLACK:3, so I need BLACK:1 more. CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: The board has BLACK:0 available - I cannot take BLACK tokens! My only option is to use a gold token as a substitute. This turn, I'll reserve L2_70 (RED:6, 3 points, RED bonus) to get GOLD:1 (bringing me to 10 tokens: WHITE:3, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3, GOLD:1). Next turn (turn 23), I'll buy L3_81 using WHITE:1, BLACK:3, GOLD:1 (gold substitutes for the missing BLACK), reaching 10 points. Reserving L2_70 specifically is strategic because: (1) After L3_81, L2_70's effective cost drops to RED:3 (RED:6 - RED:3 bonus), and I'll have RED:2, needing only RED:1 more - a clear 3-point path. (2) Buying L2_70 later would give me 13 points and RED:4 bonus total, meeting noble N5's RED:4 requirement (N5 needs RED:4, BLACK:4 for 3 additional points). (3) It prevents my opponent (who has RED:2 bonus) from taking this valuable card. This 2-turn path to 10 points is faster than buying L1_10 for free, which delays L3_81 to turn 24 for only a BLUE bonus with no points.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am currently tied with the opponent at 6 prestige points. My most efficient path to a lead is through Noble N7, which requires 3 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Black bonuses. I have 2 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Black bonuses, so I need exactly 1 more Red bonus. Card L2_67 (Red, 2 prestige points) fits perfectly; buying it would grant me 2 points and trigger Noble N7 for another 3 points, a total gain of 5 points. The effective cost of L2_67 is 3 Blue tokens (Cost: 1W, 4B, 2G; covered by 1W, 1B, 3G bonuses). I currently have 2 Blue tokens and need 1 more. The board has exactly 2 Blue tokens available. Taking both serves two critical purposes: it ensures I have the liquidity to purchase L2_67 next turn, and it completely denies Blue tokens to my opponent, who currently has 0 Blue tokens and needs them to compete for high-value Blue cards or Noble N9. Taking 2 Blue tokens is the optimal aggressive and strategic play to secure my victory path.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLUE tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: My score is tied with the opponent at 6, but they are token-capped at 10, forcing them to waste efficiency on their next turn. I need to accelerate my scoring. My current bonuses (White:1, Blue:1, Green:3, Red:2, Black:3) are 1 Red short of triggering Noble N7 (3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Black). Card L2_67 (Red bonus, 2 pts) is available. Its cost is 1 White, 4 Blue, 2 Green. With my bonuses, I need to pay 0 White, 3 Blue, 0 Green. I currently have 2 Blue tokens. By taking 1 Blue, 1 Red, and 1 White token, I will have exactly 3 Blue tokens next turn to purchase L2_67. This purchase grants the Red bonus, triggering Noble N7 immediately for a total of 5 points (2 card + 3 noble), jumping my score to 11. Taking White also denies the opponent the single White token available, which is critical for them to purchase the Level 3 White cards (L3_76, L3_78) on the board. Taking Red (only 1 available) further denies their Noble progress.

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=5, GLD=1}
Reasoning: This is the moment I've been building toward! I can finally buy L3_81 (4 points, WHITE bonus) to reach 10 points. Let me verify the purchase: L3_81 costs WHITE:3, RED:3, BLACK:6. With my bonuses (WHITE:2, RED:3, BLACK:2), the effective cost is WHITE:1, RED:0 (covered by RED:3 bonus), BLACK:4. I currently have WHITE:3✓, BLACK:3, GOLD:1. Using GOLD:1 to substitute for the missing BLACK token, I can complete the purchase: WHITE:1 + BLACK:3 + GOLD:1 = 5 tokens spent. After purchase, I'll have WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2 remaining (5 tokens), and my score increases from 6 to 10 points, breaking the 6-6 tie with a 4-point lead. This purchase also gives me WHITE:3 bonus total, which is valuable for future cards. My opponent at 6 points with 7 tokens cannot match this - they lack the resources for any Level 3 cards (L3_76 needs WHITE:7 effective cost WHITE:6, L3_78 needs WHITE:7 + BLUE:3, L3_89 needs BLUE:3 + GREEN:3). From 10 points, my path to 15 is clear: I have L2_70 reserved (3 points, RED bonus), which after gaining WHITE:3 bonus costs RED:6 - RED:3 = RED:3 effective. I have RED:2, so I need RED:1 more token to buy L2_70 next turn (reaching 13 points). Then nobles or Level 2 cards finish the game. This is the correct execution of my multi-turn strategy.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am currently at 6 prestige points, trailing the opponent who has 10. My bonuses are White:1, Blue:1, Green:3, Red:2, Black:3. I am exactly 1 Red bonus short of triggering Noble N7 (requires 3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Black). Card L2_67 (Red bonus, 2 pts) is available on the board. Its cost is 1 White, 4 Blue, and 2 Green. With my bonuses, the effective cost is 0 White, 3 Blue, and 0 Green. I currently hold exactly 3 Blue tokens. Purchasing L2_67 is immediately affordable. This purchase grants 2 prestige points and the Red bonus, bringing my Red total to 3. This satisfies the requirements for Noble N7, which will visit immediately, granting an additional 3 prestige points. In total, this move increases my score from 6 to 11, overtaking the opponent. It also reduces my token count from 7 to 4, keeping my economy flexible for future turns.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 points, opponent at 11 points - they're ahead by 1! Critical threat analysis: My opponent (with BLACK:3 bonus) can take BLACK:2 next turn, then purchase L2_46 (3 points, effective cost BLACK:3) on turn 26, reaching 14 points with only 1 point needed for victory. I MUST block L2_46 to prevent this winning sequence. By reserving L2_46 this turn: (1) I permanently block opponent's fastest 3-point card, forcing them toward slower 1-point options like L2_42, (2) I gain GOLD:1, bringing my total to 6 tokens (WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, GOLD:1), (3) Next turn (25), I can purchase my reserved L2_70 (3 points, RED bonus) - L2_70 costs RED:6, with my RED:3 bonus = effective RED:3, and I can pay with RED:2 tokens + GOLD:1 wildcard, reaching 13 points with RED:4 bonus total. From 13 points with RED:4 bonus, I have clear paths to 15: accumulate GREEN:1 and buy L2_42 (1 point, effective GREEN:2 with bonuses) for 14 points, then pursue another 1-2 point card, or build toward qualifying for Noble N5 (RED:4 check, BLACK:4 - I have BLACK:2, need 2 more). This defensive-yet-advancing strategy prevents opponent from reaching 14 points quickly while setting up my own 15-point finish. Without blocking L2_46, opponent reaches 14 points in 2 turns and wins on turn 27.

Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: My current score is 11, and my opponent is at 10. The opponent has a Level 3 card (L3_76, 4 points) that costs 7 White. They currently have 2 White tokens and 3 White bonuses, meaning they are exactly 1 White token short of purchasing it and jumping to 14 points. The board only has 1 White token available. By taking this White token, along with Blue and Green (to build towards my own win condition via L3_89 or L3_76), I effectively block their strongest scoring move for this turn. Additionally, I maintain a token count of 7 (below the limit of 10) and gather resources necessary to reach the 15-point threshold myself before they can recover.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=2, RED=5, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 points, opponent at 11 - they're ahead by 1! This is the critical moment to purchase L2_70 (my reserved card) for 3 points, reaching 13 points and retaking the lead. L2_70 costs RED:6; with my RED:3 bonus, effective cost is RED:3. I have RED:2 tokens + GOLD:1 wildcard = exactly RED:3 payment. After purchase: 13 points, RED:4 bonus total, remaining tokens WHITE:2, GREEN:1 (3 total). Strategic rationale: (1) Opponent's threat: They can buy L2_50 next turn (costs WHITE:2, RED:1, BLACK:4, effective WHITE:1, BLACK:1 with their bonuses WHITE:1, RED:3, BLACK:3) for 2 points → 13 points, tying me. But buying L2_70 NOW puts me ahead first. (2) From 13 points, my path to 15 is clear: L2_42 costs WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLACK:2, with my bonuses (WHITE:3, GREEN:1, BLACK:2) effective cost is GREEN:2 only. I have GREEN:1, board has GREEN:2. Turn 27 I take GREEN:1, turn 28 I buy L2_42 for 1 point → 14 points. (3) RED:4 bonus from L2_70 qualifies me halfway for Noble N5 (needs RED:4✓, BLACK:4 - I have BLACK:2, need 2 more). (4) Alternative (taking tokens) delays scoring by a full turn, letting opponent catch up. My reserved L2_46 (3 points, BLACK:6) requires BLACK:4 effective but I have BLACK:0 - too expensive to pursue immediately. L2_70's RED cost aligns perfectly with my RED:2 + GOLD:1, making it the optimal purchase to maintain tempo in the race to 15.

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: The opponent is at 13 points and poised to win on their next turn (Turn 26) by taking 2 Black tokens (3 available) to trigger Noble N5 (4 Red/4 Black), which would give them 3 points for a total of 16. I am currently at 11 points. To prevent this, I must deny them Black tokens. I will take 2 Black tokens, leaving only 1 on the board, which makes it impossible for them to reach 4 Black (they have 2 bonus + 1 token = 3). This effectively blocks their immediate win condition. I will also take 1 Blue token to build towards my own potential purchases (L1_8 or L2_51) in the following turns. While this move delays my own scoring, blocking the opponent's guaranteed win is the critical priority. My tokens will be White:2, Blue:2, Green:1, Red:2, Black:3 (Total 10), which is exactly at the limit.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: I am at 11 points, trailing the opponent who has 13. I need to score immediately to stay in the game. Card L2_50 (2 points, Blue bonus) is affordable. Its cost is 2 White, 1 Red, and 4 Black. With my bonuses (1 White, 3 Red, 3 Black), the effective cost is 1 White and 1 Black. I have 2 White tokens and 1 Black token, so I can purchase it immediately. This brings my score to 13, tying the opponent, and increases my Blue bonus to 2. With 2 Blue, 3 Red, and 3 Green bonuses, I am now only 1 Blue bonus away from triggering Noble N9 (requires 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Green). Card L1_10 (Blue bonus) is available on the board and effectively free with my current bonuses. By purchasing L2_50 this turn, I set up a guaranteed win on the following turn: buying L1_10 will grant the 3rd Blue bonus, triggering Noble N9 for 3 additional points, totaling 16 points. The opponent cannot win on their next turn, so this aggressive scoring path secures my victory.

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I'm tied 13-13 with my opponent in a critical endgame position. CRITICAL THREAT ANALYSIS: Opponent can buy L1_10 next turn (turn 27) for FREE - L1_10 costs WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, and with opponent's bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:3), every single cost is covered by bonuses: WHITE:1-1=0, GREEN:1-3=0, RED:2-3=0, BLACK:1-3=0. Buying L1_10 gives them BLUE:3 total bonus (currently BLUE:2 + 1), which INSTANTLY qualifies them for Noble N9 (requires BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3 - they already have GREEN:3✓, RED:3✓). This means 13 + 0 (L1_10 points) + 3 (N9 noble) = 16 points on turn 27, winning immediately. I MUST block L1_10 to prevent this instant loss. By reserving L1_10: (1) I permanently block opponent's N9 path, (2) I gain GOLD:1 (reaching WHITE:2, GREEN:1, GOLD:1 = 4 tokens), (3) Opponent is forced to slower alternatives. After blocking L1_10, opponent's best move is L2_56 (RED:5, BLACK:3 cost, effective RED:2, BLACK:0 with their bonuses - they have RED:2 tokens, so affordable) for 2 points → 15 on turn 27, triggering endgame. Turn 28 becomes final turn, where I can buy L2_42 (effective GREEN:2 cost) using GREEN:1 + GOLD:1 wildcard for 1 point → 14. While 14<15 means defeat, reserving L1_10 is the ONLY move preventing immediate turn-27 loss. ALL alternatives (reserving other cards, taking tokens, buying 0-point cards) allow opponent's L1_10+N9 instant win. This is the best defensive play in a losing position.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_10, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am currently tied with the opponent at 13 prestige points. I have identified a winning move. Card L2_56 is available on the board, providing 2 prestige points. Its cost is 5 Red and 3 Black. I possess 3 Red bonuses and 3 Black bonuses. I also hold 2 Red tokens. My bonuses cover the full Black cost and 3 of the 5 Red cost. My 2 Red tokens cover the remaining cost. By purchasing L2_56, I spend 2 Red tokens, gain 2 prestige points, and increase my score to 15. This meets the victory condition and ends the game immediately before the opponent can make their move. This action also denies the opponent the opportunity to buy this same card (which would have given them 15 points) or trigger Noble N5 (which would have given them 16 points).
