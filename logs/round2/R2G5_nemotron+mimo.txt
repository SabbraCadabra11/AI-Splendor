Reasoning: At the start of turn 1 I have no tokens, so I must take either three different colors or two of the same color. None of the visible prestige cards can be afforded yet, so the goal is to acquire a flexible set of resources that can be built toward the most common costs. Green appears on the majority of Level 1 and Level 2 cards (L1_24, L1_7, L2_53, L2_70, L3_86, L3_90) and is also required for several nobles. White and Blue are also needed for several cards (e.g., L1_28, L2_65, L3_76). Taking one White, one Blue, and one Green gives me a foundation to eventually purchase L1_28 (cost WHITE 1, BLUE 3, GREEN 1) after gathering more Blue tokens, or to work toward L2_53 (cost GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2) later. Taking two of a single color would give only one resource type and limit future purchasing options. Therefore I choose to take one token of each of these three colors.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: It's turn 1, and I have only 3 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1). I cannot purchase any card immediately because all visible cards require more tokens than I have. The best course is to take tokens to set up for purchasing a card on my next turn. The card L1_25 (GREEN bonus, cost WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) is a good target because it costs only 4 tokens and provides a GREEN bonus, which will help reduce future costs for green-bonus cards. I already have WHITE and BLUE tokens, so I need RED and BLACK tokens. Since I must take exactly 3 tokens (or exactly 2 of the same color), I take one RED, one BLACK, and one GREEN token as the third color. This combination is available on the board (RED:4, BLACK:4, GREEN:3). After taking these tokens, I will have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, which allows me to purchase L1_25 on my next turn using WHITE, BLUE, RED, and BLACK tokens, leaving me with GREEN:2 tokens and a GREEN bonus. This efficiently builds my engine with minimal risk.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: My current token pool is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1 (total 3). To be able to purchase any of the visible cards, especially the Level‑1 card L1_25 which requires exactly one WHITE, one BLUE, one RED, and one BLACK, I need to acquire both RED and BLACK this turn. I can take exactly three tokens of three different colors; no color has 4 or more tokens on the board, so I cannot take a double of the same color. The board supplies at least one of each color, so I can safely take RED, BLACK, and one additional distinct color. Adding WHITE as the third distinct color increases my WHITE count to 2, still leaving me with at least one WHITE and one BLUE for the future purchase, while also giving me the RED and BLACK required to finally afford L1_25 on my next turn. This move does not exceed the 10‑token limit (I will have 5 tokens after the take), so no tokens need to be returned. Taking RED and BLACK now sets up a direct path to buying L1_25 next turn, which is the cheapest visible purchase and moves me toward prestige points. Therefore I will take one WHITE, one RED, and one BLACK token.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L1_25 immediately with my current tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1). This card costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, which I have exactly. Purchasing it will give me a GREEN bonus and reduce my token count to WHITE:1 and GREEN:1, setting me up for future purchases. No other face-up cards are affordable with my current tokens and no bonuses. This action is efficient as it follows my previous plan and avoids unnecessary token management.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_25]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_25
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens currently: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. The card L1_25 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, which I can afford exactly. Purchasing it will give me a GREEN bonus and reduce my token count to 2 (WHITE:1, GREEN:1), setting me up for future purchases. No other face-up cards are affordable with my current tokens. This move efficiently builds my engine without wasting tokens.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_25]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_25
Reasoning: I am currently player 1 with tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I can purchase the card L1_25 immediately because its cost (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) matches my token holdings. Purchasing this card gives me a GREEN bonus, which will reduce future costs for green-bonus cards, and it costs only 4 tokens, making it an efficient engine-building move. After purchase, I will have WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 tokens, which is within the token limit and sets me up for future actions. There are no other affordable cards on the board, and taking tokens or reserving would delay acquiring this bonus without clear benefit.

Player 1 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_25. Skipping turn.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently hold 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK tokens (total 5). The board provides tokens of each color, allowing me to take any three distinct colors, but I do not need to take more tokens because I can already afford a visible card. Among the face‑up cards, L1_25 is the only one I can purchase this turn: it costs exactly 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 RED, and 1 BLACK—tokens I already have. Buying L1_25 gives me the GREEN bonus gem, which expands my flexibility for future purchases and moves me closer to the 15 prestige points needed to win. No other visible card is affordable, and purchasing this card also prevents my opponent from potentially taking it later. Therefore I will purchase L1_25, spend the required tokens, and gain a development card that contributes to my engine.

Action chosen: PURCHASE_CARD with card_id "L1_25".
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_25]

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have current tokens GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1, and no bonuses or purchased cards. I cannot afford any face-up card directly with my current tokens. I plan to purchase L1_1 on my next turn, which costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 and provides a BLACK bonus. I already have GREEN:1 and RED:1, so I need WHITE and BLUE tokens. Since I must take exactly 3 tokens (or exactly 2 of the same color), I take one WHITE, one BLUE, and one GREEN token. This combination is available on the board (WHITE:3, BLUE:4, GREEN:2). After taking these tokens, I will have GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, WHITE:1, BLUE:1, which is exactly what I need to purchase L1_1 on my next turn without exceeding the token limit of 10. This action efficiently sets up for acquiring a BLACK bonus, which will help reduce costs for future black-inclusive cards and align with noble requirements like N6.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2}
Reasoning: Current token pool is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED1, BLACK1 (total 6). I can take exactly three distinct colors. The board has limited tokens, so I must choose colors that advance my engine and block the opponent. Taking a GREEN token brings my GREEN count to 3, which combined with the permanent GREEN gem gives a total of 4 GREEN resources, enabling me to purchase the Level‑1 card L1_24 next turn (cost 4 GREEN) for 1 prestige point. Adding WHITE and BLUE provides additional WHITE (needed for many high‑cost cards and nobles) and extra BLUE (useful for L1_28, L2_65, L3_76, and noble N4). This combination keeps my total tokens at 9, staying below the 10‑token limit, so no tokens need to be returned. The chosen take advances my path to both a prestige card and noble completion while denying the opponent access to these key colors.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0) because all face-up cards require tokens I lack, such as RED for L1_1 or BLUE for L1_28. Therefore, I must take tokens to set up for a future purchase. The most efficient target is L1_1, which costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 and provides a BLACK bonus. I already have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, so I need only one RED token to afford L1_1 on my next turn. Since I must take exactly three tokens of three different colors (as no color has 4+ available for taking two of the same), I take one RED token to meet the requirement for L1_1. Additionally, I take one WHITE token and one BLACK token because WHITE tokens are scarce (only 1 available on the board), and BLACK tokens are useful for future purchases like L2_65 or L2_53, especially after acquiring a BLACK bonus from L1_1. This action leaves me with 8 tokens, under the limit, and positions me to purchase L1_1 next turn efficiently.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3}
Reasoning: We currently have 9 tokens (WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK2). The only face‑up prestige cards we can afford next turn are L2_65 (1 prestige point) and L2_53 (1 prestige point), but both require 3 BLACK tokens while we only have 2. The board supplies only BLUE, RED, and BLACK tokens, so we must take exactly one of each colour. Taking these three would bring us to 12 tokens, so we must return 2 tokens to stay ≤10. By returning one BLUE and one GREEN we keep our BLACK count at 3 (2+1) while ending the turn with a token pool of WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED3, BLACK3 – exactly 10 tokens. This gives us the 3 BLACK tokens needed to purchase L2_65 on the following turn, netting 1 prestige point and a RED bonus gem, bringing us closer to the 15‑point goal while also denying the opponent access to these key resources.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can purchase card L1_1 immediately with my current tokens: I have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, and the cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. This purchase is efficient because it requires no additional token-taking, saving a turn. After purchasing, I gain a BLACK bonus, which will help reduce costs for future black-inclusive cards and align with noble requirements like N6 (which requires BLUE:3, WHITE:3, BLACK:3 in bonuses). This action builds my engine without risking token overflow or wasting turns on unnecessary token acquisition.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current token pool is WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK1. The most promising prestige card to purchase soon is L2_53 (1 prestige point) which costs GREEN3, RED2, BLACK2. We already have one RED and one BLACK, so taking one RED and one BLACK this turn will bring RED to 2 and BLACK to 2, satisfying those requirements. Adding a GREEN token gives us GREEN2 tokens; combined with the permanent GREEN bonus gem we will have exactly 3 GREEN resources, meeting the GREEN3 cost. This set of three distinct colors also uses only colors that are present on the board, stays under the 10‑token limit, and blocks the opponent from gaining these key resources. No return tokens are needed. Therefore we take one RED, one BLACK, and one GREEN.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Malformed JSON response: Unrecognized token 'I': was expecting (JSON String, Number, Array, Object or token 'null', 'true' or 'false')
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2) and one BLACK bonus from purchased card L1_1. I can purchase card L2_65 from the face-up cards in LEVEL_2. Its cost is WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3, but with my BLACK bonus, the effective cost is WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:2. I have exactly these tokens, so I can afford it. Purchasing L2_65 gives me 1 prestige point and a RED bonus, which helps my engine and moves me closer to 15 points. This is better than taking tokens, as taking tokens would likely require returning tokens due to my current token count (9), which is inefficient. Reserving a card would give me a gold token but no points, so purchasing now is more efficient for scoring.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_65]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_65
Reasoning: I am Player 1 with tokens WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2 and a GREEN bonus from L1_25. I can purchase card L2_53 because its cost is GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:2. After applying my GREEN bonus, I need to pay GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2, which matches my current tokens exactly. Purchasing this card gives me 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus, aligning with my strategy to build bonuses for nobles like N6 (which requires WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK bonuses). This action is efficient as it scores a point immediately and frees up tokens for future moves without risking token overflow.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: The current token pool (WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK2) together with the permanent GREEN gem allows us to afford L2_53, which costs GREEN3 RED2 BLACK2. After applying the GREEN discount we need to spend exactly GREEN2 RED2 BLACK2 – all of which we have. Purchasing L2_53 nets 1 prestige point and grants a permanent WHITE gem, which is highly valuable for future high‑cost cards and nobles. This is the only visible card we can buy that yields prestige this turn, and acquiring a WHITE gem accelerates progress toward the 15‑point goal while also denying the opponent the chance to claim L2_53 later. No token take is required, we stay well under the 10‑token limit, and no return actions are needed.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card directly with my current tokens (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2). The best immediate goal is to acquire L2_65, which costs WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3 but with my BLACK bonus, effective cost is WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:2. I already have BLACK:2, so I need one more WHITE and one more RED. Since I must take exactly three tokens of different colors (no color has 4+ available for taking two of the same), I take one WHITE and one RED to meet the requirements for L2_65. The third color is BLUE, as it may be useful for future cards like L1_2 or L1_28 and doesn't hinder my plans. After taking these tokens, I will have enough tokens to purchase L2_65 on my next turn, gaining 1 prestige point and a RED bonus, which efficiently progresses my engine.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: We have 3 tokens (WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN0, RED0, BLACK0). No visible card can be purchased with the current resources, even after any legal token take, because all prestige cards require more RED, BLACK, or GREEN than we can generate this turn. The board supplies BLUE, GREEN, RED, and BLACK tokens, so we must take exactly three distinct colors. Our long‑term goal is to acquire enough RED and BLACK tokens to later buy L2_65 (1 prestige point) and to build toward higher‑value cards such as L2_59 or L3_86. Taking a RED, a BLACK, and a GREEN token gives us one of each of those critical colors, moves us closer to the 2‑RED/3‑BLACK requirement for L2_65, and also provides a GREEN token that can help meet the cost of L2_59 later. This take also removes one RED and one BLACK token from the board, limiting the opponent’s ability to use those colors. Adding the three tokens brings our total to 6, well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. Therefore the optimal action is to take one RED, one GREEN, and one BLACK token.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens because I lack the required tokens for all face-up cards. Specifically, for L2_65, I need one more WHITE and one more RED, but WHITE tokens are not available on the board (WHITE:0). Therefore, I cannot take WHITE tokens to complete the purchase. Instead, I reserve L2_65 to secure it for future purchase and gain a gold token. The gold token can be used as a substitute for any color, so when I reserve L2_65, I obtain a gold token that can later be used as a WHITE token. After reserving, I will have one gold token, and on my next turn, I can take one RED token (and two other tokens) to then purchase L2_65. This strategy prevents the opponent from potentially acquiring L2_65 and allows me to efficiently gain points and a RED bonus.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: The board currently provides only BLUE, GREEN, RED, and BLACK tokens. I have 6 tokens and must take exactly three distinct colors. I choose to take GREEN, BLUE, and BLACK. Taking a BLACK token removes the only remaining BLACK from the board, preventing the opponent from obtaining the third BLACK needed for their reserved L2_65 card, thereby blocking a direct path to 15 prestige points. Simultaneously, gaining a GREEN token moves my GREEN count toward 3, which, combined with my permanent GREEN gem, will allow me to purchase the Level‑1 prestige card L1_24 (1 prestige point) in the near future. Adding a BLUE token increases my BLUE resources, supporting future high‑value cards and noble N4. This take adds exactly 3 tokens, raising my total to 9, well below the 10‑token limit, so no tokens need to be returned. Thus the optimal move is to take one GREEN, one BLUE, and one BLACK token.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase L2_65 from my reserved cards because I have sufficient tokens and bonuses to cover its cost. The cost is WHITE:2, RED:2, BLACK:3, and with my bonuses (WHITE:1 and BLACK:1), I only need to pay 1 WHITE, 2 RED, and 2 BLACK tokens, which I currently have. Purchasing this card will give me 1 prestige point and a RED bonus, increasing my score to 1 and building my engine for future cards. This action is efficient as it reduces my token count from 9 to 4, avoiding token overflow and setting up for future moves. There are no other affordable face-up cards, and taking tokens would likely require returning tokens due to my high token count, which is inefficient.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current token pool is 9. No color has 4+ tokens, so we must take exactly three distinct colors, which adds 3 tokens, exceeding the 10‑token limit, so we must return two tokens. Our long‑term goal is to purchase the Level‑2 prestige card L2_65, which requires WHITE 2, RED 2 and BLACK 3. We already have WHITE 2, RED 1 and BLACK 2, so we need one RED and one BLACK. Taking WHITE, RED and BLACK satisfies those needs while preserving the two whites needed for the purchase. After taking these three colours we would have 12 tokens, so we must return two. We return one BLUE and one GREEN, which are the colours we have in surplus and do not hurt our immediate plan. This leaves us with WHITE 3, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 3 – exactly 10 tokens and precisely the resources to buy L2_65 next turn for 1 prestige point and a RED gem. Therefore the optimal move is to TAKE_TOKENS with the specified take/return values.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens because I lack sufficient tokens for all face-up cards. Specifically, for L2_59, I need one more GREEN and one more RED to afford it. Since I am at the token limit of 10, I must take tokens and return some to stay within the limit. I decide to take one GREEN, one RED, and one BLACK token to gain the necessary tokens and secure a scarce BLACK token. After taking, I will have 13 tokens, so I must return three tokens. I will return one BLUE token and two BLACK tokens, as I don't immediately need BLUE tokens for L2_59, and returning some BLACK tokens keeps my token count manageable while preserving GREEN and RED tokens for the purchase. This sets me up to purchase L2_59 on my next turn, gaining 1 prestige point.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1, BLACK=2}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot return 2 BLACK tokens: player only has 1 available (including taken).
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card with my current tokens because all face-up cards require tokens I lack. Specifically, for L2_59, I need one more RED token to afford it, but with 10 tokens, taking tokens would require returning 3 tokens, which is inefficient. Instead, I reserve L2_59 to secure it for future purchase and gain a gold token. By returning one BLACK token, I stay at 10 tokens and have the gold token. On my next turn, I can purchase L2_59 using my tokens and the gold token, gaining 1 prestige point and a GREEN bonus. This strategy allows me to gain a point card without wasting turns on token management.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_59, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn={BLACK=1}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot return 1 BLACK tokens: player only has 0 available.
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1. My bonuses are RED:1 and BLACK:1. I cannot purchase any face-up card with my current tokens because all cards require tokens I lack. For example, L1_28 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, but I have no WHITE and only one BLUE, so I need to take tokens to afford it. The most efficient target is L1_28, which provides a GREEN bonus that I don't have yet, helping future purchases. To afford L1_28, I need one WHITE token and two BLUE tokens (since I have GREEN:1). I currently have one BLUE, so I need one more WHITE and one more BLUE. I must take exactly three tokens of different colors since no color has 4+ available for taking two of the same. I will take one WHITE, one BLUE, and one GREEN token. Taking GREEN is useful for other cards like L2_59 or L1_24. After taking these tokens, my token count will be WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, which allows me to purchase L1_28 on my next turn by paying WHITE:1, BLUE:2, and GREEN:1 (using my existing GREEN token). This action sets up an efficient purchase without token overflow and builds my engine with a new bonus.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current token pool is at the maximum of 10 tokens (WHITE3, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED2, BLACK3). To afford the Level‑2 prestige card L2_59 (cost WHITE3, GREEN2, RED3) next turn we need one additional RED token while still keeping enough WHITE tokens for its WHITE3 requirement. We have an excess of WHITE tokens (3) and can safely discard one. By taking three distinct colors—RED, BLUE, and GREEN—we add one RED and keep the token count at 13, which exceeds the limit, so we must return three tokens. Returning one WHITE, one BLUE, and one GREEN brings the total back to exactly 10 while netting a net gain of one RED token and a loss of one WHITE token (WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED3, BLACK3). This gives us the required RED3, WHITE2+WHITE gem = 3 WHITE, and GREEN1+GREEN gem = 2 GREEN to purchase L2_59 next turn for 1 prestige point and a GREEN gem, accelerating our path to 15 points while denying the opponent key resources.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}]

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1. My bonuses are RED:1 and BLACK:1. I can directly purchase L1_28 from the face-up cards because its cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1. With my current tokens, I have WHITE:1 (covers WHITE:1), BLUE:2 (need one more BLUE), and GREEN:2 (covers GREEN:1). I can use my GOLD:1 token as a substitute for the missing BLUE token. This purchase is efficient as it requires no additional token-taking, saving a turn. After purchasing, I gain a GREEN bonus, which complements my existing bonuses and helps with future purchases like L2_59 or noble requirements (e.g., N4 requires GREEN:4, BLUE:4). I considered purchasing L1_7 or L1_2, but they offer redundant bonuses (BLACK) and no prestige points, whereas L1_28 provides a new bonus type. Taking tokens or reserving cards would be less efficient since I can already afford this card directly.

Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: With 10 tokens currently in hand (WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED3, BLACK3) and permanent gems WHITE:1 and GREEN:1, the only prestige card we can afford this turn is L2_59 (cost WHITE3, GREEN2, RED3). Our token counts plus the permanent gems exactly meet the requirement (2 WHITE + permanent WHITE = 3, 1 GREEN + permanent GREEN = 2, 3 RED). Purchasing L2_59 yields 1 prestige point, adds a GREEN permanent gem (increasing our GREEN bonus from 1 to 2), and moves us closer to the 15‑point goal. No other visible prestige card can be bought (L2_70 needs 6 RED, L3_86 needs 7 BLUE, etc.). Since we can purchase the card directly without needing to take or return tokens, the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD L2_59.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I cannot purchase any card directly with my current tokens (only GREEN:1). The most efficient target is L1_24, which provides 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus—a new bonus type for me. However, its cost is GREEN:4, and with my GREEN bonus of 1, I need to pay GREEN:3 tokens. I currently have only GREEN:1 token, so I need two more GREEN tokens to purchase it. By reserving L1_24, I secure it for future purchase and gain a gold token, which can substitute for any color. This reduces the required GREEN tokens to two (since gold can act as one GREEN), meaning I only need to take one additional GREEN token to afford it. Reserving also prevents the opponent from acquiring this point-giving card and provides flexibility with the gold token. Taking tokens now would require multiple turns to accumulate enough GREEN tokens, and purchasing other cards like L1_7 would delay point scoring without adding significant value. Thus, reserving L1_24 is the optimal move to progress efficiently toward 15 points.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: We currently hold 3 BLACK tokens and need one more to reach the 4 required for Noble N3 (3‑point bonus). The board provides only a single BLACK token, so taking it is essential to advance toward that noble. Simultaneously, we have no WHITE tokens, and Noble N3 also demands 4 WHITE tokens; by taking two WHITE tokens we make significant progress toward that threshold while still respecting the rule that we may take at most two of a colour only when at least four are available (WHITE has four on the board). Taking 2 WHITE and 1 BLACK gives us exactly three new tokens, raising our total from 4 to 7, well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are necessary. This move also removes the only BLACK token from the board, preventing the opponent from gaining another BLACK token and further blocking their path to 15 points. After this take we will have WHITE2, BLUE1, BLACK4 plus our permanent gems (WHITE1, GREEN2), positioning us to either claim Noble N3 next turn or afford a prestige card such as L1_40 (cost WHITE4) in the near future. Therefore the optimal action is to TAKE_TOKENS with take_WHITE=2 and take_BLACK=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=2, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: Our current token pool is small (BLUE 1, BLACK 3) and we need more WHITE and RED gems to move toward high‑value prestige cards such as L1_40 (1 point, cost WHITE 4) and L2_65 (1 point, cost WHITE 2 RED 2 BLACK 3). The board has abundant WHITE (4) and RED (4) tokens, so we can legally take 2 WHITE and 1 RED in a single turn, satisfying the rule for taking exactly three tokens where one color appears twice. This move adds 3 tokens to our current 4, bringing us to 7 tokens—well below the 10‑token limit—so no returns are required. By gaining two WHITE tokens we edge closer to the 4 WHITE resources needed for L1_40, while also acquiring a RED token that contributes to the RED 2 requirement for L2_65. This acquisition also removes a RED token from the board, limiting the opponent’s options. Thus the optimal action is to TAKE_TOKENS with 2 WHITE and 1 RED.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=2, RED=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: Current token pool is WHITE0, BLUE1, GREEN0, RED0, BLACK3 (total 4 tokens). We need to acquire more WHITE tokens to eventually afford L1_40 (cost WHITE4, worth 1 prestige point and a RED gem) and to build toward other high‑value cards. White is the only color with 4+ tokens on the board (4 available), so we may legally take exactly 2 WHITE tokens in one action. Taking 2 WHITE adds only 2 tokens, keeping our total at 6, well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. This move also depletes the opponent’s supply of WHITE tokens, slowing any strategy that relies on them. Taking RED, GREEN, or BLUE would not bring us closer to a purchasable prestige card in the next turn, whereas 2 WHITE directly advances our near‑term goal and is a legal TAKE_TOKENS action.

Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 1 and need to reach 15 points. I have a reserved card L1_24 that gives 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus, which is a new bonus for me. To purchase L1_24, I need to pay GREEN:4 tokens, but with my GREEN bonus of 1, I only need to pay GREEN:3 tokens. Currently, I have GREEN:1 and GOLD:1, so I need one more GREEN token to cover the cost (using GOLD as GREEN). This turn, I must take tokens since I cannot purchase any card directly that gives points. I cannot take only one token; I must take exactly 3 tokens of different colors or 2 of the same color. No color has 4+ available tokens for taking two of the same, so I will take three different colors. I choose to take WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN tokens to acquire the needed GREEN token while also collecting WHITE and BLUE tokens for future purchases, such as L2_67 or L1_40. After taking these tokens, I will have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, and GOLD:1, which allows me to purchase L1_24 on my next turn by paying GREEN:3 tokens (using GREEN:2 and GOLD:1). This action efficiently progresses toward scoring points without token overflow and builds my engine with a new WHITE bonus.

Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: The board currently holds only one WHITE, two BLUE, two GREEN, four RED and one BLACK token. My current token pool is 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 3 BLACK (total 6 tokens). To make progress toward 15 prestige points I need to move from acquiring bonuses to buying prestige cards. The only prestige card I can purchase in the next turn is L1_40, which costs WHITE4 and is worth 1 prestige point plus a RED gem. By taking the single WHITE token on the board together with two other distinct colors I will reach exactly four WHITE resources (2 in hand + 1 permanent WHITE gem + 1 taken WHITE), enabling me to buy L1_40 on my next turn. I also want to hinder my opponent’s path to 15 points. They are working toward purchasing the reserved L1_24, which requires four GREEN resources; taking a GREEN token reduces the available GREEN tokens from 2 to 1, making it harder for them to meet that requirement. Choosing BLUE as the third color gives me an additional BLUE token, moving me closer to the many high‑value cards that need BLUE (e.g., L2_67). The chosen three colors are all distinct, satisfying the TAKE_TOKENS rule, and the total token count will rise from 6 to 9, well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. Therefore the optimal action is to take one WHITE, one BLUE and one GREEN token.

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I can purchase my reserved card L1_24 because I have sufficient tokens. The cost is GREEN:4, but with my GREEN bonus of 1, I need to pay GREEN:3. I have GREEN:2 and GOLD:1, so I can use GOLD as a substitute for one GREEN, covering the cost. This will give me 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus, increasing my score to 2 and building my engine with a new bonus type. Purchasing this card is efficient as it uses my reserved card and avoids token overflow.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current token pool is 3 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 3 BLACK (total 9). Permanent gems are WHITE 1 and GREEN 2. The only prestige card we can afford right now is L1_40 (LEVEL_1), which costs exactly 4 WHITE. We have 3 WHITE tokens plus the permanent WHITE gem, giving us the required 4 WHITE resources. No other visible prestige card can be purchased with our current resources, and taking tokens would not yield immediate prestige points while risking returning tokens and losing valuable resources. Purchasing L1_40 therefore gives us 1 prestige point immediately, adds a RED permanent gem (expanding our discount options), and does not require any token take or return, avoiding unnecessary token management. This is the most efficient move toward reaching 15 points while also denying the opponent the chance to claim the card later.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 2, needing 13 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:0, and my bonuses are WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I cannot purchase any face-up card directly due to insufficient tokens. The most efficient move is to reserve a point-giving card to secure it for future purchase and gain a gold token. L2_67 offers 2 prestige points and a RED bonus, which complements my existing RED bonus. After reserving, I will have a gold token that can substitute for any color, reducing the cost of L2_67 to 3 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens when purchased. This sets up a path to score points in the next few turns by taking tokens to accumulate the required BLUE and GREEN tokens. Reserving prevents the opponent from acquiring this card and aligns with my strategy to transition to point-scoring while building my engine.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: The current board holds 3 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 4 RED, and 1 BLACK token. Player 0 holds 0 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 3 BLACK tokens (total 6). All affordable prestige cards (L1_2, L1_7, L1_22, L1_18) give 0 prestige points, so immediate point gain is not possible. The most valuable next move is to accelerate toward a 3‑point RED‑cost card (L2_70) and to block the opponent’s reliance on BLUE and GREEN. By taking one WHITE, one BLUE, and one RED token we: (1) obtain a needed WHITE token for future high‑value purchases, (2) add a RED token toward the 6‑RED requirement for L2_70, and (3) remove the only BLUE token from the board, hindering the opponent who is working toward a GREEN‑intensive reservation. This take uses exactly three distinct colors, adds 3 tokens (total 9) without exceeding the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. It also preserves our existing BLUE tokens for later use and keeps our token distribution balanced. Therefore the optimal action is a TAKE_TOKENS move with WHITE, BLUE, and RED.

======================================================================================

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 2, needing 13 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1, and my bonuses are WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. I have one reserved card, L2_67, which requires 4 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens after bonuses, but BLUE tokens are currently unavailable on the board (available BLUE:0). This makes purchasing L2_67 difficult in the short term. Instead, I should focus on securing a point card that uses available tokens. L2_58 is a level 2 card with 3 prestige points and a WHITE bonus, and its cost is WHITE:6. With my WHITE:1 bonus, I need to pay 5 WHITE tokens. Currently, I have only 1 WHITE token, and available WHITE tokens are 2, so acquiring enough WHITE tokens will take multiple turns. By taking two GOLD tokens this turn, I increase my gold count to 3, which can substitute for up to 3 WHITE tokens. This reduces the number of actual WHITE tokens needed to 2. On my next turn, I can take one WHITE token, bringing my WHITE tokens to 2, and then on the following turn, I can purchase L2_58 by paying 2 WHITE tokens and 3 gold tokens (using gold as WHITE substitutes). This approach is efficient because it minimizes the number of turns required to purchase a point card and leverages gold tokens to overcome token shortages. Taking other tokens would not accelerate point acquisition as quickly, and reserving L2_58 would delay the process since I would spend a turn reserving instead of taking gold. Therefore, taking two gold tokens is the optimal move to progress toward scoring points.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I must take tokens this turn since I cannot purchase any card directly with my current tokens, and the game error indicates that a token take is required. My current tokens are WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1, and I have a reserved card L2_67 that requires GREEN:1 and BLUE:4 after bonuses. Since BLUE tokens are unavailable (board shows BLUE:0), I cannot take BLUE, so I focus on taking other colors that build towards my goals. I choose to take GREEN (essential for L2_67 and other cards), BLACK (scarce with only 1 available, denying it to the opponent), and RED (useful for cards like L2_70). This selection helps me accumulate resources for future purchases without token overflow, as I have only 3 tokens currently and will have 6 after taking. I avoid taking WHITE since it is less critical for my immediate needs, and I prioritize colors that align with my point-scoring strategy.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: The board currently only has WHITE, GREEN and RED tokens available. To make progress toward 15 prestige points I need to acquire more WHITE and GREEN resources (especially to block the opponent who is working toward a GREEN‑intensive reservation) and also gain a RED token for future high‑value cards. Because my token pool is already at the maximum of 10, taking three distinct colors would push me over the limit, so I must return three tokens. I return one BLUE and two BLACK tokens, which I have in surplus, preserving the remaining BLUE and keeping at least one BLACK for later play. This exchange gives me +1 WHITE, +1 GREEN and +1 RED while keeping my total token count at 10, advancing my resource base and hindering the opponent without wasting valuable BLUE or GOLD tokens.

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 2, and I need to reach 15 points. I have a reserved card L2_67 that gives 2 prestige points and a RED bonus, but I cannot afford it yet because I need BLUE:4 and GREEN:1 after bonuses. Currently, I have BLUE:1, GREEN:1, and GOLD:1, so I need 2 more BLUE tokens to cover the cost (using GOLD as one BLUE). The board has only 1 BLUE token available, so I must take it now to secure it before the opponent does. Additionally, I need to take two other tokens to meet the take tokens action rule. I choose to take WHITE and RED tokens because they are scarce (only 1 available each), which denies the opponent and may help with future purchases. After this turn, I will have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1. On my next turn, I can reserve a card to gain a second GOLD token, which will allow me to purchase L2_67 using BLUE:2 and GOLD:2 as BLUE:4, covering the cost with my existing GREEN:1. This strategy efficiently progresses towards scoring points without token overflow and secures a key point-giving card.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: The board currently shows only GREEN and BLACK tokens, so a legal TAKE_TOKENS move (3 distinct colors or 2 of a kind with ≥4 available) is impossible. Therefore we must either RESERVE a card or PURCHASE one of the visible cards. Purchasing gives immediate progress toward higher‑value cards while reserving only locks a card without improving our resource base. Our current tokens (WHITE2, BLUE2, GREEN2, RED2, BLACK1) together with permanent discounts (WHITE1, GREEN2, RED1) let us afford L1_7, which costs only GREEN3. After applying the GREEN2 discount we need just one GREEN chip, which we have. Buying L1_7 gives us a permanent WHITE gem, raising our WHITE discount from 1 to 2. This discount will dramatically reduce the cost of many high‑value prestige cards that require many WHITE resources (e.g., L3_76, L3_82, L3_90), bringing us closer to the 15‑point goal more efficiently than simply reserving a high‑point card that we cannot afford soon. It also removes L1_7 from the board, potentially changing the token pool in our favor. No immediate prestige points are available, so the optimal use of this turn is to secure the WHITE discount via L1_7. Hence the best action is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_7, taking no tokens and returning none.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_7]

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 2, needing 13 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1, and I have a reserved card L2_67 that requires 4 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens after bonuses. However, the board has no BLUE tokens available, so I cannot take tokens this turn because only GREEN and BLACK tokens are available, and neither has 4+ tokens to take two of the same, and I cannot take three different colors with only two available. I also cannot purchase any face-up card due to insufficient tokens, particularly for L2_67 where I need one more BLUE token. Therefore, the only feasible action is to reserve a card to gain a gold token. This will give me a second gold token, allowing me to purchase L2_67 on my next turn by using both gold tokens as BLUE tokens. I choose to reserve L1_32 from the face-up cards because it offers a prestige point and a GREEN bonus, which could be useful later, and it is visible on the board.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: The board currently contains only GREEN, BLACK and GOLD tokens, with no WHITE or BLUE tokens available. Because my token pool is already at the maximum of 10, any TAKE_TOKENS action would force me to return three tokens, which would waste valuable resources. The only prestige card I can afford right now is L1_8 (cost BLUE4, prestigePoints 1). I can pay its cost using my 2 BLUE tokens plus my 2 GOLD tokens, which substitute for the missing 2 BLUE units. Purchasing L1_8 gives me an immediate 1 prestige point, raising my score from 3 to 4, and grants a permanent BLACK discount (increasing it from 1 to 2). This discount will make future high‑value BLACK‑cost cards cheaper and brings me closer to the 15‑point goal. No other visible card provides prestige points, and purchasing L1_8 also removes a potential future resource for my opponent. Therefore the optimal move is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_8, spending the required tokens and gaining the prestige point and discount without any token take or return.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_8]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_8
Reasoning: The board currently only has GREEN and BLACK tokens, and taking three distinct colors would force us to exceed the 10‑token limit, requiring returns that waste valuable resources. Instead, we can purchase a visible card that is affordable with our current tokens and gives a permanent discount. L1_18 costs BLUE1 (after discounts on GREEN, RED, and BLACK), which we can pay with one of our two BLUE tokens. Purchasing L1_18 grants a WHITE gem, increasing our WHITE discount from 1 to 2. This will dramatically lower the effective cost of many high‑value Level‑3 prestige cards (e.g., L3_76, L3_82, L3_90), bringing us closer to the 15‑point goal more efficiently than any token‑taking move. The purchase is legal, does not require returning tokens, and directly improves our resource discount strategy.

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 2, needing 13 more points to reach 15. I currently have 10 tokens, so taking tokens would require returning an equal number, which is inefficient. I can purchase L2_58 from the face-up cards, which costs 6 WHITE tokens. With my WHITE bonus of 2, the effective cost is reduced to 4 WHITE tokens. I have WHITE:2 and GOLD:2, so I can pay with 2 WHITE tokens and use 2 GOLD tokens as substitutes for the remaining 2 WHITE tokens. Purchasing L2_58 gives 3 prestige points and a WHITE bonus, increasing my score to 5 and my WHITE bonus to 3. This is more efficient than purchasing my reserved card L2_67, which would only give 2 points. By purchasing now, I reduce my token count to 6, allowing flexibility for future token takes without immediate return, and I continue building towards point-scoring goals.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_58]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_58
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 2, needing 13 more points to reach 15. I have reserved card L2_67, which requires 4 BLUE and 1 GREEN tokens after bonuses (cost reduced due to my GREEN bonus). Currently, I have BLUE:2, GREEN:1, and GOLD:2. Since GOLD tokens can substitute for any color, I can use my BLUE tokens (2), both GOLD tokens as BLUE (2), and my GREEN token (1) to cover the cost exactly. Purchasing L2_67 gives me 2 prestige points and a RED bonus, increasing my score to 4 and building my engine. This action is efficient because it uses existing resources without taking tokens (I am at maximum token capacity, so taking tokens would require returning tokens, which is wasteful). I cannot purchase any face-up card directly with my current tokens, and reserving another card is unnecessary since I have two reserved cards already. Therefore, purchasing L2_67 is the optimal move to score points immediately.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: The board holds 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 2 BLACK, and 5 GOLD tokens. My current hand has 7 tokens total (WHITE2, BLUE1, GREEN1, RED2, BLACK1). To eventually purchase L1_22, which costs 2 BLUE and 2 BLACK and would give a permanent WHITE gem that raises my WHITE discount to 3 – a key long‑term advantage toward 15 points – I must acquire at least one more BLUE and one more BLACK token. The only legal way to gain tokens is to take exactly three distinct colors. I must therefore take BLUE and BLACK, and the third slot can be GREEN or GOLD. Taking GOLD provides a wild token that can be used as any color later, offering more flexibility than an extra GREEN token, which I already have sufficient of and which the opponent does not heavily rely on. Taking BLUE, BLACK, and GOLD adds one of each, bringing my total to exactly 10 tokens, so no returns are needed. This move secures the resources needed for the next turn’s purchase of L1_22, increases my WHITE discount permanently, denies the card to the opponent, and removes valuable BLUE and BLACK tokens from the board, all while avoiding any token return penalty.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: Current token pool has 2 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 2 RED, 1 BLACK (total 5 tokens). The board provides BLUE (3), GREEN (3), and BLACK (2) tokens, each with at least one available, allowing a legal TAKE_TOKENS move of three distinct colors. Taking one of each of these colors adds exactly 3 tokens, bringing the total to 8, which is under the 10-token limit, so no returns are needed. This acquisition gives us the missing BLUE token (essential for purchasing many high-value cards), a GREEN token (useful for future discounts and potential GREEN-cost cards), and an additional BLACK token (helps toward BLACK-cost cards and nobles). No other action is currently viable: no visible card can be purchased without additional tokens, and reserving a card would only yield a gold token without immediate resource gain. Therefore, the optimal move is to take one BLUE, one GREEN, and one BLACK token.

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 4, needing 11 more points to reach 15. My current tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:0, and my bonuses are WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1. I cannot purchase any face-up card directly due to insufficient tokens, as all cards require tokens I lack. I have one reserved card, L1_32, which requires 3 BLACK tokens after bonuses (cost BLACK:4, reduced to 3 due to my BLACK bonus). I currently have only 1 BLACK token, so I need 2 more BLACK equivalents. Since only 1 BLACK token is available on the board, I need at least one gold token to substitute for another BLACK. Gold tokens are obtained by reserving a card. Therefore, reserving a card this turn will give me a gold token, bringing me to 1 BLACK and 1 GOLD (equivalent to 2 BLACK). Next turn, I can take tokens to get the remaining 1 BLACK token from the board, and then purchase L1_32 on the subsequent turn. Reserving L1_8 from the face-up cards is a good choice because it gives me a gold token and a future point opportunity if I accumulate BLUE tokens, while also denying the opponent from using it. This strategy efficiently progresses towards scoring points without wasting turns on low-value purchases.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: The board currently contains only BLUE (2), GREEN (2) and BLACK (1) tokens. My token pool is at the maximum of 10, so any TAKE_TOKENS action would require returning an equal number of tokens and would not change my composition meaningfully. The only affordable cards are the Level‑1 cards L1_2, L1_22, L1_36 and L1_19. Among them, L1_19 costs only 2 BLUE tokens after applying my existing discounts (WHITE2, GREEN2, RED1, BLACK1) and yields a WHITE‑gem bonus. Purchasing it will increase my WHITE discount from 2 to 3, which dramatically lowers the effective cost of many high‑value Level‑3 prestige cards (e.g., L3_76, L3_82, L3_90) that require many WHITE resources. This discount is more impactful for reaching the 15‑point goal than the alternative WHITE‑discount cards that cost additional BLACK tokens, or the BLACK‑discount card L1_2 which offers less future benefit. Buying L1_19 also reduces my token count to 8, giving me headroom for future token‑taking without exceeding the 10‑token limit. Therefore the optimal move is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_19, which provides a vital discount upgrade while staying within all game constraints.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_19]

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, GRN=1, RED=4, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 4, needing 11 more points to reach 15. I have reserved card L1_32, which requires 3 BLACK tokens after bonuses (cost reduced from 4 due to my BLACK bonus of 1). Currently, I have 1 BLACK token and 1 GOLD token, so I need one more BLACK token to have 2 BLACK and 1 GOLD, which covers the cost of 3 BLACK equivalents. The board has only one BLACK token available, so I take it to secure it before the opponent does. Additionally, I take one BLUE and one GREEN token because they are available and will help me purchase other cards in the future, such as L1_8 (which requires BLUE tokens) or point-giving cards like L2_62. Taking three different tokens (BLUE, GREEN, BLACK) follows the rules and does not exceed my token limit of 10 (current tokens: 6, after taking: 9), so no tokens need to be returned. This action efficiently progresses towards purchasing L1_32 next turn, which will give me 1 point and increase my GREEN bonus, building my engine for future point-gaining opportunities.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: The board currently only shows BLUE (3) and GREEN (1) tokens, which is insufficient to perform a legal TAKE_TOKENS move (requires 3 distinct colors or 4 of a kind). Therefore the only viable actions are to either purchase an affordable face‑up card or to reserve a visible card. Purchasing the only affordable Level‑1 cards (L1_36 or L1_38) would give a RED gem but would not advance my prestige total and would consume valuable BLACK or RED tokens that I may need later for higher‑value purchases. The long‑term goal is to reach 15 prestige points while blocking my opponent, who is likely aiming for a GREEN‑intensive reservation. The highest‑value visible card that also grants a GREEN gem is L3_86 (5 prestige points). Reserving this card blocks the opponent from acquiring a major prestige source, grants me a gold token for future flexibility, and leaves open the possibility of purchasing L3_86 later when I have sufficient discounts. This move directly advances my 15‑point target and prevents the opponent from securing a key card.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=4, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 4, needing 11 more points to reach 15. I have two reserved cards: L1_32 (cost BLACK:4, reduced to 3 BLACK after my BLACK bonus) and L1_8 (cost BLUE:4). With my current tokens (BLACK:2 and GOLD:1), I can exactly cover the cost for L1_32 by using 2 BLACK tokens and 1 GOLD token as a BLACK substitute. Purchasing L1_32 gives me 1 prestige point and a GREEN bonus, increasing my score to 5 and my GREEN bonus to 2. This efficiently uses my tokens without exceeding limits and progresses towards scoring points. Other actions like taking tokens would require returning tokens due to my current 9 tokens, which is inefficient, or purchasing face-up cards would give no points. Reserving another card would not provide immediate points. Thus, purchasing L1_32 is the optimal move to gain points and build my engine.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_32]

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: The board provides only BLUE, GREEN, and BLACK tokens, so a legal TAKE_TOKENS move would add three tokens and push the total from 9 to 12, forcing us to return two tokens and waste resources. None of the visible prestige cards are affordable, and reserving a high‑value card would only give a gold token without immediate progress. The only affordable face‑up cards are L1_36 (cost 2 BLACK) and L1_38 (cost 1 RED after discounts). Purchasing L1_38 grants a WHITE gem, raising our WHITE discount from 3 to 4. This discount dramatically reduces the effective cost of many Level‑3 prestige cards (e.g., L3_76, L3_82, L3_71) that require many WHITE resources, accelerating our path to the 15‑point goal more effectively than the modest RED discount from L1_36 or any token‑taking move. Therefore the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_38, spending the single RED token we hold and improving our engine for future high‑value purchases.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Malformed JSON response: Unexpected character ('#' (code 35)): expected a valid value (JSON String, Number, Array, Object or token 'null', 'true' or 'false')
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 5, needing 10 more points to reach 15. I have one reserved card L1_8 that requires 4 BLUE tokens, but I only have BLUE:1, so accumulating enough BLUE tokens will take multiple turns. Instead, I can efficiently gain points by purchasing L1_16, which gives 1 point and a BLUE bonus. To purchase L1_16, I need RED:4 tokens; I currently have RED:2, so I need 2 more RED tokens. By reserving a card this turn, I will gain one GOLD token, which can substitute for any color. On the next turn, I can take tokens including RED (e.g., RED, BLUE, and another color), giving me one RED token, so I have RED:3 and GOLD:1, which is equivalent to RED:4, allowing me to purchase L1_16 from my reserved hand in the same turn after taking tokens. This strategy gains a point and a BLUE bonus in two turns, avoids token overflow, and denies L1_16 from the opponent. I choose to reserve L1_16 from the face-up cards.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: We have 8 tokens (WHITE2, BLUE0, GREEN2, RED1, BLACK2, GOLD1). The board provides BLUE3, GREEN1, RED1, BLACK2 tokens, enabling a TAKE_TOKENS move only if we stay ≤10 tokens, but any such move would require taking three distinct colors and would force us to return a token, wasting resources. Looking at affordable face‑up cards, L1_4 costs RED3 – GREEN1 – BLACK1 originally; after applying our discounts (RED2, GREEN2, BLACK1) the net cost is exactly 1 RED token, which we have. Purchasing L1_4 gives a BLACK‑gem bonus, raising our BLACK discount from 1 to 2. This strengthens our ability to pay future high‑cost BLACK cards (e.g., L1_36, nobles) and brings us closer to the 15‑point goal more efficiently than any token‑taking move, which would only add tokens without immediate prestige gain. The purchase is legal, does not exceed the 10‑token limit, and requires no token returns. Therefore the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_4.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_4]

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 5, needing 10 more points to reach 15. I have reserved card L1_16, which costs 4 RED tokens. With my current RED bonus of 2 (from purchased cards), the cost is reduced to 2 RED tokens. I currently have 2 RED tokens, so I can purchase L1_16 immediately without needing additional tokens. Purchasing this card gives me 1 prestige point (increasing my score to 6) and a BLUE bonus, which will help reduce the cost of future cards like L1_8 (which requires 4 BLUE tokens). This action is efficient because it gains points without wasting turns on token accumulation, and it avoids token overflow since I have only 7 tokens currently. Other actions, such as taking tokens or reserving cards, would not provide immediate points and might delay my progress. Therefore, purchasing L1_16 is the optimal move.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current token pool (WHITE 2, BLUE 0, GREEN 2, RED 0, BLACK 2, GOLD 1) gives us 6 colored tokens. Board offers BLUE (3), GREEN (1), RED (4), BLACK (2) tokens. Our discounts (WHITE 3, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 2) make the Level‑3 prestige card L3_71 cost exactly 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN and 1 RED after discounts; we already have 2 GREEN, so we need one more GREEN, plus one BLUE and one RED. Taking one BLUE, one GREEN and one RED satisfies this requirement while keeping total colored tokens at 9 (<10), so no returns are needed. This move enables us to purchase L3_71 on the next turn for 3 prestige points, directly advancing our goal of 15 points and also blocks a valuable card from the opponent. Other options (purchasing a Level‑1 card, reserving L3_86, or taking other token combos) either yield no immediate points or require more scarce resources and do not bring us closer to an affordable prestige card this turn. Therefore the optimal action is to TAKE_TOKENS with BLUE, GREEN and RED.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Malformed JSON response: Unexpected character ('#' (code 35)): expected a valid value (JSON String, Number, Array, Object or token 'null', 'true' or 'false')
Reasoning: I am player 1 with score 6, needing 9 points to reach 15. I have reserved card L1_8 which gives 1 point but requires 3 BLUE tokens after bonuses, and I currently have only 1 BLUE token. Instead, reserving L2_62 from the face-up cards gives 2 points and allows me to gain a gold token, bringing my gold to 2. On the next turn, I can take tokens to get one BLUE token, resulting in BLUE:2 and GOLD:2, which enables purchasing L2_62 on the following turn using 2 BLUE and 2 GOLD tokens. This strategy gains 2 points in three turns, which is more efficient than gaining 1 point from L1_8 in two turns. Additionally, reserving L2_62 denies the opponent from using it.

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: We are at the maximum of 10 tokens (including 1 gold). Any TAKE_TOKENS action would force us to return tokens and would not directly advance our goal, because we have no immediate affordable prestige card that can be bought without additional tokens. The only cards we can afford now are low‑cost Level‑1 purchases. After applying our current discounts (WHITE 3, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 2) the net costs are:
- L1_36 costs exactly 1 BLACK token, which we can pay (we hold 2 BLACK). Buying it will raise our RED discount from 2 to 3, further reducing the cost of red‑intensive prestige cards such as L3_90 and L2_57.
- L1_20 costs 1 BLUE token, but we only have 1 BLUE and we want to keep that token for future high‑value cards that require BLUE (e.g., L3_71).
- Other visible cards (L1_2, L1_22, L2‑cards, L3‑cards) require more tokens than we can currently spend without exceeding the 10‑token limit, and would necessitate a TAKE_TOKENS that would waste resources.
- Reserving a Level‑3 prestige card would only give a gold token and delay actual point gain; it does not improve our discounts and leaves us without immediate progress toward the 15‑point target.

Therefore the most efficient move is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_36. It costs only a single BLACK token, stays within the token limit, improves a key discount, and does not consume our scarce BLUE token. This purchase brings us closer to being able to afford the high‑value Level‑3 prestige cards that will push us toward the 15‑point goal while also limiting the opponent’s options.

Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 6, needing 9 points to reach 15. I have reserved cards L1_8 and L2_62. L1_8 gives 1 point but requires BLUE tokens, and L2_62 gives 2 points. Currently, I can purchase L1_10 from the face-up cards for free, as my bonuses (WHITE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1) cover its cost exactly (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1). Purchasing L1_10 increases my BLUE bonus from 1 to 2, which reduces the cost of L2_62 from requiring 4 BLUE equivalents (after bonus) to 3 BLUE equivalents. With my current tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:2), after increasing BLUE bonus, I can purchase L2_62 on the next turn by using 1 BLUE token and 2 GOLD tokens as BLUE equivalents (covering 3 BLUE equivalents), and 1 GREEN token. This strategy gains 2 points in two turns and improves my engine for future purchases. Other actions, such as purchasing L1_8 now (which gains only 1 point and uses tokens needed for L2_62) or taking tokens (which delays point gain), would be less efficient.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: We have 1 BLUE token and can afford any Level‑1 card that costs only BLUE after applying discounts. L1_20 costs 1 BLUE, 3 WHITE, 1 BLACK originally, but discounts reduce WHITE (3) and BLACK (2) to 0, leaving only the 1 BLUE payment. We have exactly the needed BLUE token, so purchasing L1_20 is legal and does not require any token returns. Buying L1_20 grants a WHITE gem, increasing our WHITE discount from 3 to 4, which will dramatically lower the effective cost of many high‑value Level‑3 prestige cards (e.g., L3_71, L3_82, L3_76) that require many WHITE resources. This move directly advances our long‑term goal of reaching 15 prestige points while also improving our engine for future purchases. Other affordable cards (L1_33) give a RED gem, which is less valuable for the upcoming high‑point cards, and taking tokens would waste a turn and force returns. Therefore the optimal action is to purchase L1_20.

Turn 27 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 6, needing 9 more points to reach 15. I have reserved cards L1_8 and L2_62. L2_62 gives 2 prestige points and costs BLUE:5 and GREEN:3. After my bonuses (BLUE:2, GREEN:2), the effective cost is 3 BLUE equivalents and 1 GREEN equivalent. I have tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, and GOLD:2. I can use BLUE:1 token, GREEN:1 token, and 2 GOLD tokens as BLUE substitutes to cover the cost exactly. Purchasing L2_62 increases my score to 8 and increases my GREEN bonus to 3. This is more efficient than purchasing L1_8 (which gives only 1 point) or taking tokens, which would delay point gain. Other face-up cards like L3_71 give 3 points but are not affordable due to token constraints. Thus, purchasing L2_62 is the optimal move to gain points and progress towards victory.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_62]

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=6, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current discounts are WHITE 4, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 2 with no BLUE discount. Evaluating every visible face‑up card:
- L1_11 costs WHITE1, GREEN2, RED2. After discounts these become 0, so the net cost is 0 – it can be purchased without spending any tokens.
- L1_11 also provides a BLUE‑gem bonus, which will increase our BLUE discount from 0 to 1, opening many Level‑3 prestige cards that require BLUE (e.g., L3_76, L3_71) and accelerating progress toward the 15‑point goal.
- All other affordable cards either require paying RED, BLUE, or other colored tokens that we do not have in sufficient quantity, or would only give smaller discounts. Reserving a card would only yield a gold token and delay point gain, while taking tokens would force us to return tokens and waste a turn.
- Purchasing L1_11 costs nothing, stays well within the 10‑token limit, and directly improves our engine for the high‑value Level‑3 cards we are targeting. Therefore the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD L1_11.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_11]

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with score 8, needing 7 points to reach 15. I have only 2 tokens (WHITE:2), and no tokens of other colors. The opponent can purchase L3_71 immediately from the face-up cards because they have sufficient tokens after bonuses (they have WHITE:2, GREEN:3, RED:1, GOLD:1, which covers the cost after bonuses: 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 RED by using GOLD for BLUE). To prevent the opponent from gaining 3 points, I should reserve L3_71. This also gives me a gold token, which will be useful when I accumulate the necessary tokens to purchase it later. Other actions, such as taking tokens or reserving other cards, would not deny the opponent this valuable card and would not provide immediate points.

Turn 29 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: We can afford L2_58 after applying our WHITE discount (4). The original cost is 6 WHITE; after discount we need 2 WHITE tokens, which we have exactly (2). Paying these tokens spends 2 WHITE, keeping total tokens below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required. Purchasing L2_58 gives 3 prestige points, the highest immediate point gain available among visible cards, and moves us closer to the 15‑point goal. Other visible cards are either unaffordable or give fewer points. Therefore the optimal action is to PURCHASE_CARD L2_58.

Turn 29 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 8, needing 7 points to reach 15. The opponent has a score of 6 and can immediately purchase L3_90 from the face-up cards, which gives 5 prestige points, bringing their score to 11 and putting them in a strong position to win. To prevent this, I must reserve L3_90. This action denies the opponent a critical 5-point card and grants me a gold token, increasing my gold to 2. Although this does not give me immediate points, it secures my lead by preventing the opponent from gaining significant points. After reserving, I can focus on accumulating tokens to purchase my reserved L3_71 (3 points) on subsequent turns, which is feasible with proper token management. Other actions, such as taking tokens or purchasing low-value cards, would not address the immediate threat from the opponent and would delay my point gain.

Turn 30 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: We examine all face-up cards and compute their net costs after current discounts (WHITE 5, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 2). The only prestige cards we can afford this turn are the Level‑2 cards. L2_70 needs 3 RED, L2_46 needs 4 BLACK and L2_47 needs 1 BLUE. L2_57 needs 2 RED after discounts, and we have exactly 1 RED and 1 GOLD token; a GOLD token may substitute any colour, so we can pay the second RED with the GOLD token. Paying this cost removes 1 RED and 1 GOLD from our pool, leaving us with 3 GREEN, 1 BLACK and 0 GOLD, well under the 10‑token limit. L2_57 is worth 2 prestige points, the highest immediate point gain available, and it also gives a WHITE gem that will increase our WHITE discount, helping us acquire later Level‑3 prestige cards. No other visible card offers more than 2 points this turn, and taking tokens would only waste a turn without direct points. Therefore the optimal action is to purchase L2_57.

Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 8, needing 7 points to reach 15. I have two tokens (WHITE:2) and two gold tokens (GOLD:2). After evaluating the face-up cards, I can purchase L3_76 for 4 points by spending one WHITE token (since my WHITE bonus of 6 reduces the cost from WHITE:7 to needing only 1 WHITE token). This action brings my score to 12, requiring only 3 more points to win. This is more efficient than purchasing L2_45 for 2 points, as L3_76 gives double the points for a minimal cost. Additionally, purchasing L3_76 increases my BLUE bonus from 1 to 2, which may aid in future card purchases. While the opponent can still purchase L2_45 on their turn, gaining 2 points and reaching 10, I maintain a 2-point lead, putting me in a strong position to win soon by leveraging my reserved cards or other high-value cards.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L3_76]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L3_76
Reasoning: I need 7 points to reach 15. I have L3_71 reserved, which gives 3 points, but I cannot afford it with my current tokens (WHITE:2, GOLD:2). After bonuses, I need to pay 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, and 1 RED. I have WHITE:2 covered, but lack BLUE, GREEN, and RED tokens. By taking one BLUE, one GREEN, and one RED token this turn, I will have the necessary tokens to purchase L3_71 next turn. This strategy gains 3 points in two turns, which is more efficient than purchasing smaller-point cards now (e.g., L2_45 for 2 points but leaving me with no tokens). Taking tokens now sets up a quick point gain and allows me to continue building towards victory.

Turn 31 - Player 0's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current discounts are WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 2. After applying these discounts, the net costs of visible face‑up cards are: L1_33 and L1_34 cost 0, L2_45 also costs 0 but awards 2 prestige points and gives a BLACK token, while all other cards either require tokens we do not have or give fewer points. Purchasing L2_45 therefore maximizes immediate point gain (raising score from 8 to 10), improves our token pool with an additional BLACK token for future purchases, and requires no token expenditure. Hence the optimal action is to purchase L2_45.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_45]

Turn 31 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 8, needing 7 points to reach 15. I can immediately purchase my reserved card L3_71, which gives 3 prestige points. My current tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, GOLD:2) and bonuses (WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:1) allow me to cover the cost: after bonuses, I need to pay 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 2 GREEN, and 1 RED. I have sufficient tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1) and can use one GOLD token as a substitute for the missing GREEN token. Purchasing L3_71 increases my score to 11, bringing me within 4 points of victory. The opponent (player 0) has score 10 but cannot purchase any card immediately due to lack of tokens, giving me a critical lead. Other actions, such as taking tokens or purchasing lower-value cards, would delay point gain and risk the opponent catching up.

Turn 32 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: We have 4 tokens (3 GREEN, 1 BLACK) and all visible cards cost at least 1 token except L1_33 and L1_34, which are free after our current discounts. Purchasing either gives a RED gem, raising our RED discount from 3 to 4. This will cut the net cost of the high‑value Level‑3 card L3_82 and, more importantly, reduce the cost of L2_70 from 3 RED to 2 RED, bringing a 3‑point prestige card within reach after one more turn. Buying a free card now costs no tokens, stays well under the 10‑token limit, and directly improves our engine for the next high‑point purchase, which is the fastest path to reaching 15 prestige points. Therefore the optimal action is to purchase the free Level‑1 card L1_33.

Turn 32 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with a score of 11, needing 4 points to reach 15. The opponent (player 0) has a score of 10 and needs 5 points. The opponent can potentially win on turn 37 by purchasing high-point cards like L3_76 or L3_77. To prevent this, I must deny them these cards by reserving them. On this turn, I reserve L3_76 from the face-up cards, which gives me a gold token and prevents the opponent from purchasing it immediately. This action also allows me to set up for future turns, where I can reserve another high-point card (L3_77) on my next turn. With three gold tokens from reserves, I can use them as substitutes for GREEN tokens when purchasing my reserved L3_90, which gives 5 points and would win the game. Although I cannot purchase L3_90 immediately, this strategy delays the opponent and secures my path to victory on turn 38 if necessary.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L3_76, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 33 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current discounts (WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 4, BLACK 3) reduce the net cost of all visible face‑up cards. The only cards that cost 0 tokens are L1_34, L1_29 and L2_45. Among these, L2_45 is the only one that grants prestige points (2) and also provides a BLACK gem, which increases our BLACK discount for future turns. Purchasing it costs no tokens, stays well under the 10‑token limit, raises our score from 10 to 12, and accelerates progress toward the 15‑point goal. All other affordable cards either give 0 points (L1_34, L1_29) or require tokens we do not have (e.g., L2_70 needs 2 RED). Taking tokens would not yield immediate points and would only delay our push to 15, while also risking giving the opponent more flexibility with their gold tokens. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase the free L2_45 card.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_45]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card L2_45 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: The only cards that can be purchased this turn are those whose net cost after discounts is zero. With the current discounts (WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 4, BLACK 3) the visible free cards are L1_34 and L1_29. Buying L1_34 gives a RED‑gem bonus, raising the RED discount from 4 to 5. This moves us closer to making the 3‑point Level‑2 card L2_70 (cost RED 6) affordable in fewer turns, and it also helps any future RED‑cost purchases. The alternative free card L1_29 would increase the GREEN discount, which is less critical for the high‑value cards we need to reach 15 points quickly. Since our goal is to accelerate toward 15 prestige points and also deny the opponent a chance to claim a 5‑point card, purchasing the RED‑gem card L1_34 is the optimal immediate action.

Reasoning: I need 4 points to reach 15. I have reserved L3_76, which gives 4 points, but I cannot afford it yet because I need 6 WHITE tokens after bonuses (cost WHITE:7, my bonus WHITE:1, so need 6 WHITE). I have no WHITE tokens but have 2 gold tokens. By taking 2 WHITE tokens this turn, I will have 2 WHITE tokens. On my next turn, if I take 2 more WHITE tokens, I will have 4 WHITE tokens and 2 gold, which exactly covers the 6 WHITE needed (4 WHITE + 2 gold as WHITE). This allows me to purchase L3_76 and win immediately. Taking 2 WHITE tokens is valid since there are 4 WHITE tokens on the board. Other actions, such as purchasing low-point cards or reserving, would not gain points efficiently and might allow the opponent to catch up. The opponent cannot purchase any high-point cards immediately due to lack of tokens, so this plan is safe.

Turn 34 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current discounts are WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 5, BLACK 3. Applying these discounts to the visible face‑up cards shows that the only cards we can afford are those whose net cost consists of a small number of a single gem. L3_77 (Level‑3, 4 prestige points) has a net cost of 2 BLUE tokens after discounts. We have 0 BLUE tokens, but the board contains 4 BLUE tokens, allowing us to take exactly 2 BLUE tokens this turn (the rule permits taking 2 of the same color when 4+ are available). Taking 2 BLUE tokens adds 2 to our token pool, bringing the total to 6 tokens (3 GREEN, 1 BLACK, 2 BLUE), which stays well below the 10‑token limit, so no returns are needed. With those 2 BLUE tokens we can immediately purchase L3_77, spending the 2 BLUE tokens and gaining 4 prestige points, raising our score from 10 to 14. This is the highest immediate point gain available among all visible cards (the only higher‑value cards remain unaffordable). The purchase also adds a BLUE gem, increasing our BLUE discount from 1 to 2, further strengthening our engine for future turns. Therefore the optimal action is to take 2 BLUE tokens and purchase L3_77.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L3_77]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L3_77
Reasoning: Current discounts are WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 5, BLACK 3. After discounts, the only high‑value prestige card we can afford is L2_70, which costs 1 RED token and is worth 3 prestige points. We have 0 RED tokens, so we must acquire one this turn. The board provides 4 RED tokens, allowing us to take exactly 2 RED tokens (TAKE_TOKENS with take_RED=2). This adds 2 RED tokens to our pool, raising our total from 4 to 6 tokens—well below the 10‑token limit—so no returns are needed. After taking the tokens we will have 2 RED tokens, enough to pay the 1 RED cost of L2_70 on the next turn, enabling us to gain 3 points immediately and move closer to the 15‑point goal. No other visible card can be purchased without first obtaining a RED token, and taking tokens is the only way to obtain the needed resource this turn.

Turn 34 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I need 4 points to reach 15 and have L3_76 reserved, which gives 4 points. The cost is WHITE:7, and with my WHITE bonus of 1, I need to pay 6 WHITE tokens. I currently have 2 WHITE tokens and 2 gold tokens. Since gold can substitute for WHITE, I need 4 more WHITE equivalents. The board has only 2 WHITE tokens available, so I can acquire both, giving me 4 WHITE tokens total. With 4 WHITE and 2 gold, I can cover the 6 WHITE cost. I need to take one WHITE token this turn to have 3 WHITE, then on turn 36 take the last WHITE token to have 4 WHITE, then on turn 38 purchase L3_76. Taking one WHITE is valid via a three-token set because there are 2 WHITE available, but I can only take one since I must take three different colors. I also take BLUE and RED tokens to utilize my action and potentially slow the opponent, as they may need these colors for their plans.

Turn 35 - Player 0's move
Points: 10, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=7, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current discounts are WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 5, BLACK 3. After applying these discounts, the only visible prestige card we can afford is L2_70, which requires 1 RED token (6-5=1). We hold 2 RED tokens, so we can pay the cost immediately without exceeding the 10‑token limit (we would end with 5 tokens). L2_70 is worth 3 prestige points, the highest immediate point gain available; all other visible cards either require tokens we lack or are worth 0‑1 points. Taking tokens would not yield direct points and would waste a turn, while purchasing L2_70 directly advances our score toward the 15‑point goal and also provides a RED gem for future discounts. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L2_70.

Turn 35 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I am player 1 with 11 points, needing 4 points to win. I have L3_76 reserved, which gives 4 points, but I need 6 WHITE tokens after bonuses (cost WHITE:7, bonus WHITE:1, so net 6 WHITE needed). I currently have 3 WHITE tokens and 2 gold tokens. Taking one more WHITE token gives me 4 WHITE tokens, and with 2 gold, I have exactly 6 WHITE equivalents. After this turn, I can purchase L3_76 on my next turn and win. I take one BLUE and one BLACK token to use my action fully and slow down the opponent, who likely needs BLUE and BLACK tokens for their plans. The opponent cannot win immediately, so this move secures my victory next turn.

======================================================================================

Turn 36 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=7, BLK=4}
Reasoning: The current discounts are WHITE 6, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 6, BLACK 3. Applying these discounts to all visible face‑up cards shows that L1_29, L1_33, L1_34 and L2_70 have net cost 0. Among them, L2_70 is the only card that yields prestige points (3), and my current score is 13. Purchasing L2_70 would bring the score to 16, surpassing the 15‑point goal and ending the game with a win. The card is visible, requires no tokens to pay, and does not affect the token limit. Therefore the optimal move is to purchase L2_70 directly.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_70]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card L2_70 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: We are at 13 prestige points and need 2 more to win. The highest‑value visible card is L2_46 (3 points) but it costs 3 black tokens after discounts. We currently have only 1 black token, so we must acquire more black tokens and a wild token to meet that cost. The board supplies black, blue and red tokens; taking one of each gives us a second black token and also adds a blue token for future purchases. This brings us closer to being able to purchase L2_46 on a subsequent turn and ultimately reach 15 points. Taking exactly three different colors is legal (black, blue, red each have tokens on the board) and does not exceed the 10‑token limit, so no returns are required.
