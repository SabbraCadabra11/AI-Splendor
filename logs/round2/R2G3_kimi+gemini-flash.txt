Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: It's the first turn and I have no tokens or cards. I need to build my token economy efficiently. The cheapest Level 1 card is L1_5 costing 2 GREEN + 1 RED (only 3 tokens total), which gives a BLACK bonus - useful for the N3 noble requiring BLACK:4 and WHITE:4. I should take 3 different colored tokens to maximize early flexibility. Taking GREEN, RED, and BLACK gives me: (1) both colors needed for L1_5 (GREEN and RED), (2) a versatile color (BLACK) used in multiple cards including L1_20, L1_22, L2_61, and L3_77, and (3) progress toward both N2 (RED+GREEN) and N3 (BLACK) nobles. This sets up a coherent early strategy: acquire L1_5 next turn or soon after, gain BLACK bonuses, then work toward higher-point cards and nobles. Since I have 0 tokens, taking 3 tokens won't exceed the 10-token limit, so no returns are needed.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: In the early game, I need to begin building a resource base to purchase Level 1 cards and establish bonuses. Looking at the board, card L1_5 requires green and red, and card L1_36 requires white, red, and black. By taking Red, Black, and Blue, I am positioning myself to afford several different low-level cards depending on how the next turns develop, while keeping my options open for a diverse range of colors.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (3 tokens total). I need 1 more GREEN to purchase L1_5 (cost: 2G+1R) which gives a BLACK bonus and aligns with my N3 noble strategy (needs BLACK:4, WHITE:4). Taking GREEN, WHITE, and BLACK tokens: (1) provides the missing GREEN for L1_5, which I can purchase next turn; (2) builds toward N3 noble with WHITE and BLACK; (3) acquires scarce BLACK tokens (only 2 remain); (4) maintains flexibility for future purchases. I will have 6 total tokens after this move (under the 10-token limit), so no returns are needed.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am currently holding 1 Blue, 1 Red, and 1 Black token. My goal is to acquire card L1_22 (cost: 2 Blue, 2 Black) to start my resource engine. By taking 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Black token this turn, I will have exactly 2 Blue and 2 Black tokens (plus 1 White and 1 Red), allowing me to purchase L1_22 on my next move. Taking the only available Black token also prevents my opponent from using it this round.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have WHITE=1, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=2 (6 tokens total). The card L1_5 costs 2 GREEN + 1 RED, which I can afford exactly with my current tokens. This was my planned target from the first two turns. Purchasing it now will: (1) Give me a BLACK bonus, directly progressing toward the N3 noble that requires BLACK:4 and WHITE:4; (2) Free up token space, dropping me from 6 to 3 tokens total; (3) Enable future purchases of BLACK-heavy cards like L1_20, L1_36, L2_61, and L3_77 more cheaply. No other cards are affordable at this moment. This is a highly efficient turn that executes my early game plan and positions me for mid-game point scoring via nobles and higher-tier cards.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 Blue and 2 Black tokens, which exactly matches the cost of card L1_22 (2 Blue, 2 Black). Purchasing this card allows me to start my engine with a White bonus without needing to take more tokens from the limited board supply. This White bonus is a strategic starting point for many visible Level 2 cards, such as L2_61 and L2_41, which require multiple White resources. This purchase follows through on the preparation made in the previous turns.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have WHITE=1, BLACK=2 tokens (total 3) with BLACK=1 bonus. I cannot purchase any cards this turn. My strategic goal is N3 noble requiring BLACK:4 and WHITE:4. 

Key insights:
1. Taking WHITE, BLACK, and BLUE now gives me: WHITE=2, BLACK=3 tokens + BLACK=1 bonus = effective BLACK=4, meeting the BLACK requirement for N3!
2. This denies scarce WHITE (2 left) and BLACK (2 left) tokens from my opponent who has WHITE=1 and may target N3 or N1.
3. I only need WHITE=4 total now (currently at WHITE=2 effective), so I need 2 more WHITE via tokens or bonuses.
4. This positions me to target WHITE-bonus cards like L1_20 (3W,1B,1Bl) or L1_19 (2B,2G,1Bl) to gain WHITE bonuses.
5. Taking BLUE gives flexibility for future purchases and card costs.
6. My token total will be 6, well under the 10-token limit, so no returns needed.

This is a highly efficient move that advances my noble strategy while denying resources to my opponent.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: With a White bonus already secured, my goal is to diversify my resource base and prepare for Level 1 and Level 2 cards. Card L1_30 (Green bonus) is a high-priority target as it only requires 2 Blue and 2 Red tokens. By taking White, Blue, and Red, I reach the necessary 2 Red tokens and move closer to the Blue requirement. Furthermore, this is a strong defensive play: there is only 1 White token left on the board, and my opponent (Player 0) needs 1 White token to afford L1_20. By taking it, I delay their progress while simultaneously advancing my own strategy.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have BLACK=3 tokens + BLACK=1 bonus = effective BLACK=4, meeting the N3 noble's BLACK requirement. I have WHITE=2 tokens with no WHITE bonus, so I need 2 more WHITE to claim N3 (3 prestige points). The board has 0 WHITE tokens available, so I cannot take WHITE directly this turn. 

Card L1_20 (bonus WHITE) costs 3W+1B+1Bl, which with my BLACK bonus reduces to 3W+1B. I currently have 2W+1B, so I'm exactly 1 WHITE short of purchasing it. This is the most accessible WHITE-bonus card available.

Critical threat assessment: Opponent has WHITE=2 tokens + WHITE=1 bonus = effective WHITE=3. They have 0 BLACK tokens. The board has only 1 BLACK token remaining. If opponent takes that BLACK token this turn (as part of a 3-different take), they would have the necessary resources (2W+1B+1Bl) to purchase L1_20 next turn, directly competing for my N3 strategy. 

Optimal move: Reserve L1_20 now. This action: (1) Secures the WHITE-bonus card before opponent can take it, (2) Grants me 1 GOLD token (board has 5 available), bringing my total tokens to 7 (under the 10-token limit), (3) Sets up a guaranteed purchase next turn where I can use the GOLD as the missing WHITE token, paying 2W + 1GOLD(as W) + 1B to acquire the card, (4) Denies opponent a key card that would synergize with their existing WHITE bonus. This creates a clear 2-turn path to my first WHITE bonus and advances me toward the 3-prestige N3 noble. No other action advances my strategy as efficiently while simultaneously blocking my opponent.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_20, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, RED=2}
Reasoning: I am currently focusing on building a versatile resource engine. To afford card L1_30 (Green bonus), I need 1 more Blue token (current: 1, cost: 2). To afford L1_33 (Red bonus), I need 1 Green and 1 Black token (current: 0 of each, cost: 1 each). By taking 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Black, I will have the necessary resources to purchase either of these cards on my next turn depending on the board state. This move also utilizes the last available Black token, preventing my opponent from using it to further their own objectives this round.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have WHITE=2, BLUE=1, BLACK=3, GOLD=1 (7 tokens) with BLACK=1 bonus. My reserved card L1_20 (WHITE bonus) costs WHITE=3, BLUE=1, BLACK=1. With my BLACK bonus, cost reduces to WHITE=3, BLUE=1. I can pay using WHITE=2 + GOLD=1 (as WHITE) + BLUE=1. This purchase will: (1) Give me WHITE=1 bonus, advancing my N3 noble strategy (need WHITE:4, currently at effective WHITE=3 with 2 tokens + 1 bonus); (2) Reduce my token count from 7 to 3, maintaining flexibility; (3) Execute my reserved plan immediately without wasting another turn. The board has no WHITE or BLACK tokens available, so I cannot efficiently take tokens to help my strategy. Opponent has effective WHITE=3 and may compete for N1 or N3 nobles, making it crucial I secure this WHITE bonus now. This is the most efficient path to gaining prestige points.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have exactly 2 Blue and 2 Red tokens, which satisfies the cost for card L1_30. Purchasing this card provides a Green bonus, which is a key component for acquiring more complex cards like L1_19 and the prestige-point-bearing Level 2 cards (such as L2_61 and L2_41). This move follows my established strategy of building a versatile resource engine rather than just accumulating tokens, as it puts my existing resources to immediate use and avoids the 10-token limit.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current state: I have BLACK=3 tokens with bonuses WHITE=1, BLACK=1. My N3 noble requires BLACK=4 and WHITE=4. I already have effective BLACK=4 (3 tokens + 1 bonus), so the BLACK requirement is met. I only need WHITE=3 more to claim N3 (3 prestige points). 

I cannot purchase any cards this turn with only BLACK tokens. Taking tokens is necessary.

Strategic considerations:
1. Taking WHITE directly advances my N3 noble strategy (need 3 more WHITE).
2. Taking BLUE builds toward N1 noble (needs BLUE=4) and is required for many cards.
3. Taking GREEN prepares me for L1_19 (WHITE bonus card) which costs B2,G2 after my BLACK bonus - this card would give me another WHITE bonus, bringing me to effective WHITE=3, only 1 away from N3.
4. Opponent has effective WHITE=3 and may compete for N1/N3; taking scarce WHITE tokens (only 2 remain) denies them resources.
5. This move keeps me at 6 total tokens, well under the limit, so no returns needed.

Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN is the most efficient path toward my noble strategy while maintaining flexibility for future card purchases.

Reasoning: I currently have White and Green bonuses and 1 Black token. My next objective is to acquire L1_33 for a Red bonus, which costs 1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Black. My existing bonuses cover the White and Green requirements, and I have the Black token, meaning I chỉ need 1 Blue token to afford it. By taking Blue, Green, and Red tokens, I prepare to purchase L1_33 on my next turn while also building a surplus of Green and Red for future cards (like L1_14 or L2_54). This move keeps my total token count at 7, avoiding the 10-token limit.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: My primary objective is to claim noble N3 (BLACK=4, WHITE=4) for 3 prestige points. Current status: BLACK requirement met (3 tokens + 1 bonus = 4), WHITE at 2 effective (1 token + 1 bonus), needing 2 more WHITE. The optimal path is acquiring L1_19 (WHITE bonus) next turn, which costs BLUE=2, GREEN=2 after my BLACK bonus. Currently I have BLUE=1, GREEN=1. The board shows only 1 WHITE token remaining, and opponent has effective WHITE=3 (2 tokens + 1 bonus) - they will likely take this last WHITE if I don't. Taking WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1 now achieves three critical goals: (1) Secures the scarce WHITE token I need for N3, denying opponent; (2) Completes the BLUE=2, GREEN=2 requirement for L1_19; (3) Sets up a guaranteed purchase next turn where I'll gain the WHITE bonus, reaching effective WHITE=4 to claim N3. This move results in 9 total tokens, well under the 10-token limit, requiring no returns. It's the most efficient path to scoring while blocking opponent's noble strategy.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have White and Green bonuses, and I possess 1 Blue and 1 Black token. Card L1_33 costs 1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Black. My bonuses cover the White and Green requirements entirely, and my tokens provide the necessary Blue and Black. Purchasing L1_33 grants me a Red bonus, which is vital for targeting higher-level cards like L2_54 or L2_59 later. This move efficiently advances my resource engine without hitting the token limit.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 9 tokens (W2,B2,G2,B3) with bonuses W1,B1. I'm one WHITE away from claiming noble N3 (requires BLACK=4, WHITE=4). I already have effective BLACK=4 (3 tokens + 1 bonus) and effective WHITE=3 (2 tokens + 1 bonus). 

Critical opportunity: Card L1_19 (WHITE bonus) is available and affordable. Cost is BLUE=2,GREEN=2,BLACK=1. With my BLACK bonus, cost reduces to BLUE=2,GREEN=2. I have exactly these tokens.

Strategic impact of purchasing L1_19:
1. Gain WHITE bonus, bringing me to WHITE=2 bonuses total
2. Effective WHITE becomes 4 (2 tokens + 2 bonuses), meeting N3 requirement
3. Can immediately claim N3 for 3 prestige points
4. This puts me at 3 points while opponent has 0
5. Removes N3 from board, denying opponent potential points
6. Leaves me with 5 tokens (W2,B3), well under limit for flexible future actions

Other options evaluated:
- Taking tokens: Cannot take WHITE/GREEN (none available), would need to return tokens due to 9-token count, and doesn't advance noble strategy
- Purchasing L1_14: Gives BLUE bonus but no immediate points, slower path to N1
- Reserving: Unnecessary since I can buy L1_19 now
- Level 2 cards: All unaffordable this turn

This is the most efficient path to scoring immediate points while maintaining board flexibility and blocking opponent's potential noble access.

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, GRN=3, RED=2}
Reasoning: I am focusing on expanding my resource engine while positioning myself for early prestige points. By taking Blue, Red, and Black tokens, I reach a state where I can afford multiple cards on my next turn. Specifically, L2_59 (1 prestige point) has an effective cost of 2 White, 1 Green, and 2 Red tokens given my current bonuses; taking a Red token gives me the necessary 2 Red tokens (since I currently have 2 White and 2 Green already). Alternatively, L1_12 (Blue bonus) will be affordable as it requires 1 Blue and 2 Green tokens. Taking the last available Black token also serves a defensive purpose, and taking the Red token limits options for Player 0 who needs Red for L1_36.

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current analysis: I have effective WHITE=4 (2 tokens + 2 bonuses) and effective BLACK=4 (3 tokens + 1 bonus), meeting N3 noble requirements for 3 prestige points. My card points are 0, so I'm at 3 total points once N3 is claimed. 

Strategic evaluation: The opponent has effective WHITE=3, GREEN=3, RED=3 and is close to N2 (needs RED=1, GREEN=1) and N1 (needs WHITE=2, BLUE=4). Board token availability: WHITE=0, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=0, GOLD=5.

I cannot purchase any cards this turn - all options are unaffordable with my current tokens (W2,B0,G0,R0,B3). I need to build toward high-point cards:
- L2_61 (2pts, GREEN bonus) needs W4,B2,B1 - need W2
- L2_54 (1pt, WHITE bonus) needs W2,B3,R3 - need R3
- L2_41 (1pt, BLACK bonus) needs W3,B2,G2 - need W1,B2,G2
- L2_59 (1pt, GREEN bonus) needs W3,G2,R3 - need W1,G2,R3

Taking BLUE, GREEN, RED achieves three objectives:
1. Provides resources needed for multiple Level 2 card purchases
2. Denies opponent critical RED and GREEN tokens they need for N2
3. Maintains token flexibility with final count of 8 (under 10 limit)

Reserving a card would give only 1 gold token, which is less valuable than taking 3 colored tokens that both advance my board position and block opponent's noble strategy. Taking 2-of-same-color is impossible as no color has 4+ tokens available.

This move optimally positions me for future high-point purchases while actively blocking opponent's path to nobles.

Reasoning: I can purchase L2_59 (1 prestige point) right now. Its cost is 3 White, 2 Green, and 3 Red. Using my existing bonuses (1 White, 1 Green, 1 Red) and current tokens (2 White, 2 Green, 2 Red), I meet the requirements exactly. This move advances my score to 1 point and improves my Green bonus engine, which is a more efficient use of my resources than accumulating more tokens when current board supply is low.

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 8 tokens (W2,B1,G1,R1,B3) with bonuses W2,B1, meeting N3 requirements (BLACK=4,WHITE=4) for 3 prestige points. At turn start, I should claim N3 automatically, putting me at 3 points vs opponent's 1 point. 

Strategic priorities after claiming N3:
1. Block opponent's N2 progression (they need RED=3, GREEN=1 more)
2. Build toward N2 for myself (need RED=4, GREEN=4)
3. Deny opponent scarce resources while maintaining flexibility

Token availability: WHITE=2, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=3. I cannot take 2-of-same-color (no color has 4+). Taking 3 tokens would put me at 11 tokens, requiring me to return 1.

Optimal move: Take WHITE, RED, GREEN and return WHITE. This effectively takes RED+GREEN (net), which both blocks opponent's N2 path and builds my own N2 progress. Denying WHITE also prevents opponent from building toward N1 later. This maintains N3 eligibility since I don't spend any WHITE or BLACK tokens. Final token count: W2,B1,G2,R2,B3 (10 tokens), keeping me under the limit while maximizing resource denial and strategic positioning.

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am preparing to purchase card L2_43, which provides 2 prestige points and a black bonus. Its cost is 1 Blue, 4 Green, and 2 Red. My current bonuses provide 1 White, 2 Green, and 1 Red, meaning the net token cost for me is 1 Blue, 2 Green, and 1 Red. I currently possess 1 Blue and 1 Green token, so taking 1 Green and 1 Red token now will allow me to afford the card on my next turn. I am also taking 1 White token to satisfy the requirement of taking 3 different colors and to build toward high-cost level 2 or level 3 cards later. This plan is more efficient than purchasing the affordable L1_12 this turn, as it prioritizes points over a marginally improved engine.

======================================================================================

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 10 tokens (W2,B1,G2,R2,B3) with bonuses W2,B1, and should have claimed N3 already for 3 prestige points. Opponent has 1 point and is close to N2 (needs 2 more RED). I cannot purchase any cards - all are unaffordable. Since I'm at max tokens, I must either reserve a card (returning 1 token) or take tokens and return 3 (wasteful). The board has only WHITE=1, BLUE=2, RED=1 available, so taking 3 different colors is possible but inefficient.

Strategic evaluation reveals that reserving L2_61 (2pts, GREEN bonus) is optimal because:
1. It secures a 2-point card that builds toward my N2 strategy (GREEN bonus brings me to effective GREEN=3)
2. I get a flexible gold token (board has 5 available)
3. I only need to return 1 token (minimal waste) vs 3 if taking tokens
4. Cost is manageable: W4,B2,B1 becomes W4,B2 with my BLACK bonus - I need only W2,B1 more
5. It blocks opponent from reserving this valuable 2-point card
6. Returning BLACK=1 is safe - I keep 2 BLACK tokens and maintain my N3 eligibility

Opponent threat assessment: They need RED=2 for N2. While taking RED would deny them, the gold token's flexibility and reserving the 2-point card provides better long-term value. Gold can substitute for RED later when I need it.

Final token count after reserving: W2,B1,G2,R2,B2,GOLD=1 (10 tokens), keeping me under the limit while maximizing strategic positioning for future purchases.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_61, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn={BLACK=1}]

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have calculated that I can afford card L2_43 this turn. Its cost is 1 Blue, 4 Green, and 2 Red. My current bonuses provide 2 Green and 1 Red. My tokens provide the remaining 1 Blue, 2 Green, and 1 Red needed. Purchasing this card grants me 2 prestige points, bringing my total to 3, and adds a Black bonus to my engine. This is the most efficient move as it prioritizes immediate points and engine growth over further token accumulation.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current status analysis: I have 10 tokens (W2,B1,G2,R2,B(black)2,G1) with bonuses WHITE=2, BLACK=1. Critically, I am at effective BLACK=3 (2 tokens + 1 bonus), just 1 short of N3 requirements (BLACK=4, WHITE=4). The opponent has 3 points and is close to N2 (needs 2 more RED). 

Strategic priority: Secure N3 THIS TURN for immediate 3 points while blocking opponent's resources. The board has only 1 BLACK token available - if I don't take it, opponent could deny my N3 path.

Optimal move: Take BLACK=1, BLUE=1, RED=1 and return BLUE=1, GREEN=1, GOLD=1. This efficient conversion gives me net +BLACK, +RED, -GREEN, -GOLD while staying at the 10-token limit.

Results: New token count W2,B1,G1,R3,B(black)3,G0 gives effective BLACK=4 (3 tokens + 1 bonus), immediately claiming N3 for 3 prestige points. I maintain effective WHITE=4 (2+2) for N1 eligibility. The return choices are optimal: returning GREEN doesn't help opponent's N2 (they already have enough effective GREEN), returning BLUE denies me nothing critical (I keep B1 token), and returning GOLD is acceptable for immediate point gain. I also build toward my own N2 with RED=3 effective.

This scores now while maintaining flexibility and blocking opponent's token access.

Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 2
Reasoning: I am at 10 tokens (max) with effective BLACK=3 (needs 4 for N3). No affordable cards give BLACK bonus. I can purchase L1_39 for RED bonus (helps N2) at cost W1, or reserve L2_41 to secure BLACK bonus for future N3. Since opponent has 3 points and I need to secure N3 quickly, reserving L2_41 is optimal. This guarantees I can get BLACK bonus next turn (cost W1,B2,G2, I have W2,B1,G2 now, need B1 more). I'll return WHITE=1 (I have 2) to make room, get GOLD token, and secure the card. This blocks opponent from this 1-point card and sets up my N3 claim.

Reasoning: I can afford L1_14 this turn using my existing engine and one Black token.

This move efficiently advances my resource engine.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 8 tokens (W1,B1,G2,R2,BLACK=2,GOLD=2) with bonuses W2,BLACK=1. My effective counts are WHITE=3 (1 token + 2 bonuses) and BLACK=3 (2 tokens + 1 bonus). I need one more of each to claim N3 for 3 prestige points and tie the opponent (who has 3 points). 

No face-up or reserved cards are affordable for immediate purchase that would give points. My reserved L2_61 (2 pts) needs W3,B1 more, and L2_41 (1 pt) needs W2,B1 more - both unaffordable.

Token availability allows taking 3 different colors: WHITE=2, BLUE=3, BLACK=2. Taking WHITE, BLACK, and BLUE gives me the needed WHITE and BLACK tokens. Since this would put me at 11 tokens, I must return 1 token. Returning BLUE minimizes strategic loss as I already have sufficient BLUE tokens and opponent needs BLUE for N1.

This move achieves:
1. Effective WHITE=4 and BLACK=4, claiming N3 for 3 points
2. Ties the opponent's score
3. Denies opponent access to scarce WHITE and BLACK tokens this turn
4. Maintains 10-token maximum for future flexibility
5. Preserves my path to N2 (need more RED/GREEN)

Alternative of taking WHITE,BLACK,RED and returning RED was considered, but returning RED doesn't deny opponent since it returns to board. Taking BLUE for return is superior.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 1
Reasoning: Current analysis: I have 8 tokens (W1,B1,G2,R2,B2,G2) with bonuses W2,B1. Opponent leads 3-0. I am extremely close to claiming noble N3 which requires BLACK=4, WHITE=4. My effective counts are WHITE=3 (1 token + 2 bonuses) and BLACK=3 (2 tokens + 1 bonus). I need exactly 1 more WHITE and 1 more BLACK token to claim N3 for 3 prestige points, tying the score.

Strategic evaluation: The board has WHITE=2, BLUE=3, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2 available. Taking 3 tokens is mandatory (no color has 4+ for 2-of-same-color). I'll take WHITE, BLACK, and RED, then return BLUE to stay at the 10-token limit.

This move accomplishes:
1. Claims N3 immediately (effective WHITE=4, BLACK=4) for 3 points
2. Increases RED to 3, blocking opponent's N2 progression (they need RED=3 more)
3. Sacrifices BLUE token (which I don't need for N3) to deny opponent's N1 path
4. Maintains 10-token count for future flexibility
5. Positions me to focus on purchasing reserved cards L2_61 (2pts) and L2_41 (1pt) next turn

I cannot purchase any cards this turn - all are unaffordable. Taking tokens to claim N3 is the highest-impact move available.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1}]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 1
Reasoning: Current state: I have 10 tokens (max) with 0 prestige points, while opponent has 3 points. My bonuses are WHITE=2, BLACK=1. I have two valuable reserved cards: L2_61 (2pts) and L2_41 (1pt), but cannot afford either this turn. I cannot purchase any Level 2 or 3 cards from the board with my current tokens. My only purchase option is L1_36 for 0 points, which is inefficient when I'm behind. 

Strategic evaluation: The opponent is at 3 points and likely aiming for more Level 2 cards. The best available board card is L2_50 (2pts, BLUE bonus), which would help toward N1 (WHITE=4, BLUE=4) and provides significant points. Since I'm at max tokens, I must either purchase, reserve, or waste tokens taking/discarding. Reserving L2_50 is optimal because:
1. It secures a 2-point card that I can purchase next turn (cost: WHITE=2, RED=1, BLACK=3 after my BLACK bonus, and I currently have RED=2, BLACK=2, GOLD=2)
2. It provides a flexible gold token for future purchases
3. It blocks opponent from this valuable card
4. It only requires returning 1 token (minimal waste) vs taking 3 and returning 3
5. It maintains my token count at 10, keeping flexibility

Action plan: Reserve L2_50, return WHITE=1 (I have 1 WHITE token), receive GOLD=1. This leaves me with tokens: WHITE=0, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, RED=2, BLACK=2, GOLD=3 (10 total), positioned to purchase L2_50 next turn while denying opponent the card.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_50, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn={WHITE=1}]

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I am taking Green, Red, and Black tokens to advance my strategy on two fronts. First, the Green token allows me to purchase L1_12 on my next turn for a net cost of only one token, further strengthening my Blue bonus engine. Second, accumulating Red and Black tokens positions me to afford point-bearing Level 2 cards like L2_66 (1 point) or L2_56 (2 points) in the near future. This move balances immediate engine expansion with long-term point acquisition while also claiming tokens that are currently in shorter supply on the board.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=3}
Reasoning: I am at 8 tokens with 0 prestige points (should be 3 once I claim N3). Opponent has 3 points and is extremely close to N2: they have effective GREEN=3 and RED=2, needing just 1 more GREEN to claim N2 (which would give them +3 points = 6 total). 

Critical board state: Only 1 GREEN token and 1 RED token are available. 

Strategic priorities: 
1. BLOCK opponent's N2 claim at all costs - taking GREEN is mandatory
2. Also take RED to further delay their N2 progress  
3. Maintain token flexibility and preserve needed resources

Analysis of options:
- Purchasing L1_36: Gives RED bonus but costs R1,B2, leaving GREEN token on board for opponent
- Reserving: Doesn't affect board tokens, lets opponent take what they need
- Taking tokens: Can deny opponent critical resources

Optimal move: Take GREEN, RED, and BLUE (3 different colors), then return BLUE. This effectively takes GREEN+RED while returning a token I have. 

Calculation:
- Current: W0,B1,G2,R2,B2,GOLD=3 (8 tokens)
- Take: G1, R1, B1 (board has supply: G1, R1, B3)
- Return: B1 (I have B1 to return)
- Final: W0,B1,G3,R3,B2,GOLD=3 (8 tokens)

Result: Opponent cannot take GREEN or RED this turn, completely blocking their immediate N2 claim. I gain resources toward my own N2. This is the highest-impact defensive move while maintaining flexibility.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1}, tokensToReturn={BLUE=1}]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 1
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 8 tokens (W0,B1,G2,R2,B2,G3) with 0 prestige points, while opponent has 3 points. My bonuses are WHITE=2, BLACK=1. I have three reserved cards (L2_61, L2_41, L2_50) but cannot afford any without spending most of my gold. Opponent is close to multiple nobles and I need to catch up in points quickly.

Evaluation of options:
1. Taking tokens: I can take 3 different colors (WHITE,BLUE,GREEN) and return 1 token, but this delays point acquisition while opponent continues to build.
2. Reserving another card: Would give me 1 gold but I'm already at 8 tokens, and this doesn't address my point deficit.
3. Purchasing from board: L2_50 costs WHITE=2,RED=1,BLACK=4. With my BLACK=1 bonus, effective cost is WHITE=2,RED=1,BLACK=3. I can pay RED=1 with tokens, BLACK=2 with tokens + BLACK=1 with gold, and WHITE=2 with gold. Total gold needed: 3 (exactly what I have). This gives me 2 prestige points immediately plus a BLUE bonus which helps toward N1 noble (WHITE=4,BLUE=4).

Strategic value of L2_50:
- Immediately scores 2 points (reducing opponent's lead from 3-0 to 3-2)
- Provides BLUE bonus, diversifying my economy and giving me a path to N1 in addition to N3
- Leaves me with 4 tokens (W0,B1,G2,R1,B0,G0), allowing me to take 3 tokens next turn without returns
- Blocks opponent from this valuable 2-point card
- Maintains my flexibility for future purchases

This is superior to taking tokens (which delays scoring) or reserving (which doesn't address the point gap). The 2-point gain is critical when trailing.

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I can afford L1_12 this turn using my existing bonuses and one Green token. Its cost is 1 Blue, 3 Green, and 1 Red; my current bonuses provide 1 Blue, 2 Green, and 1 Red, so only 1 Green token is required from my supply. This purchase adds a second Blue bonus to my engine, which will reduce the future cost of prestige-bearing cards such as L2_66 or L2_54. This move is efficient as it consumes a single token to permanently improve my purchasing power without hitting the token limit.

======================================================================================

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 6 tokens (W0,B1,G2,R1,B0,G2) and 2 prestige points. Opponent has 3 points. I have two reserved cards: L2_61 (2pts, GREEN bonus) and L2_41 (1pt, BLACK bonus). 

Key evaluation: I can immediately purchase L2_61 by paying 1 BLUE token and 2 GOLD tokens (cost: WHITE=4,BLUE=2,BLACK=1; with my bonuses WHITE=2,BLUE=1,BLACK=1, I need 2 WHITE and 1 BLUE. I can substitute the 2 WHITE with 2 GOLD).

Strategic benefits of purchasing L2_61:
1. Immediately scores 2 points, taking me from 2 to 4 points and putting me in the lead (4 vs opponent's 3)
2. Adds GREEN bonus, diversifying my economy to 4 different colors (WHITE=2,BLUE=1,BLACK=1,GREEN=1)
3. Leaves me with 3 tokens (all usable colors: G2,R1), allowing flexible token-taking next turn
4. Blocks opponent from this 2-point card
5. More efficient than reserving a Level 3 card, which would only give 1 gold and no immediate points

Alternative options:
- Purchasing L2_41: Only 1 point, less impactful
- Taking tokens: Delays scoring while opponent remains ahead
- Reserving (e.g., L3_78): Only 1 gold token, no immediate point gain
- Purchasing board cards: L2_56/L2_69 cost 2pts each but require RED/BLACK that I lack

The purchase of L2_61 is optimal because it maximizes immediate point gain, secures a lead, and maintains flexibility for future moves. After purchase, I'll have 4 points, bonuses in all needed colors for nobles, and 3 usable tokens remaining.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Card L1_18 is currently affordable for zero token cost because my current bonuses (BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1) completely cover its cost (BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1). Purchasing this card adds a WHITE bonus to my engine for free, bringing my total WHITE bonuses to 2. This move is highly efficient as it preserves my current token supply (WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) while strengthening my position for future high-point cards and nobles that require WHITE bonuses, such as L2_54, L3_78, or Noble N1.

======================================================================================

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: I have 4 tokens (B1,G2,R1) and 4 prestige points, leading opponent 4-3. My bonuses are W2,B1,G1,B1. I have L2_41 reserved but cannot afford it without gold. No Level 1 or 2 cards on the board are purchasable without gold. Since gold can only be obtained by reserving and the board has GOLD=5 available, reserving is the only productive action this turn. 

Evaluation of reserve options:
- L2_54 (WHITE,1pt): Cost W2,B3,R3. After bonuses, need B2,R3. RED tokens on board are scarce (R=2), making this difficult.
- L2_66 (RED,1pt): Cost B3,R2,B3. After bonuses, need B2,R1,B2. Requires both BLUE and BLACK.
- L2_56 (WHITE,2pt): Cost R5,B3. After bonuses, need R5,B2. Very expensive (7 tokens needed).
- L2_69 (RED,2pt): Cost B5. After B1 bonus, need B4. Simplest cost (just BLACK tokens) and highest point value.

Strategic value of L2_69:
1. Blocks opponent from a 2-point card (they have B1 bonus and could potentially collect BLACK tokens for it)
2. RED bonus diversifies my economy beyond WHITE/BLUE/BLACK and helps toward N2 noble (RED+GREEN)
3. Feasible to purchase: need 4 BLACK tokens total. Board currently has B=3, I can take 2 now and 2 after refill.
4. After buying L2_41 next turn (using the gold I get now), I'll be at 5 points and can work toward L2_69 for 7 total points.

Opponent cannot buy any Level 2 cards this turn (all require gold they don't have), but they could reserve L2_69 if I don't. Securing it now is critical.

Action plan: Reserve L2_69, receive 1 gold token, setting up L2_41 purchase next turn and securing a path to 7 points via L2_69.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L2_69, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Card L1_29 is currently available for purchase at zero token cost. Its requirement of 2 White and 1 Blue is fully satisfied by my existing bonuses (White: 2, Blue: 2). Purchasing this card adds a third Green bonus to my engine without depleting my current token supply (White: 1, Red: 1, Black: 1). This increases my power to buy higher-tier Green cards worth points, such as L2_63 or L3_83, and moves me closer to qualifying for the N2 Noble (4 Red, 4 Green). Obtaining engine components for free is always an optimal mid-game move to maintain token flexibility.

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 5 tokens (B=1,G=2,R=1,G=1) and 4 prestige points, leading opponent 4-3. My bonuses are W=2,B=1,G=1,B=1. I have two reserved cards: L2_41 (1pt, BLACK bonus) and L2_69 (2pt, RED bonus).

Key evaluation: I can immediately purchase L2_41 by paying 1 BLUE token, 1 GREEN token, and using my GOLD token for the required WHITE. This costs me 1 gold but gives me immediate benefits.

Strategic benefits of purchasing L2_41:
1. Immediately scores 1 point, extending my lead to 5-3
2. Adds BLACK bonus (bringing me to B=2), significantly helping toward N3 noble (need B=4,W=4)
3. Leaves me with 2 usable tokens (G=1,R=1), allowing flexible token-taking next turn
4. Uses gold efficiently - substituting for a WHITE token I don't have and can't easily get (board has W=3 but opponent also needs WHITE)
5. Blocks opponent from potentially acquiring this card
6. Sets me up to focus exclusively on collecting BLACK tokens for L2_69 next turn

Alternative options considered:
- Taking tokens now and buying L2_41 next turn: This saves the gold but delays scoring and risks opponent taking needed tokens or scoring points
- Reserving another Level 2 card: No immediate point gain while opponent remains close
- Waiting for L2_69: Requires 4 BLACK tokens which would take multiple turns to collect, delaying needed point progression

The immediate point gain and BLACK bonus are critical for maintaining my lead and progressing toward both N3 noble and my 2-point reserved card L2_69. After purchase, I'll have 5 points and can efficiently collect BLACK tokens next turn since the board currently has B=3 available and opponent has shown less interest in BLACK (their bonuses are heavier in GREEN/BLUE for N2/N1).

Key evaluation: I can immediately purchase L2_41 by paying 1 BLUE token, 1 GREEN token, and 1 GOLD token. The card costs WHITE=3,BLUE=2,GREEN=2. With my bonuses (WHITE=2,BLUE=1,GREEN=1), the effective cost is WHITE=1,BLUE=1,GREEN=1. I can substitute the WHITE requirement with my gold token.

Strategic benefits of purchasing L2_41:
1. Immediately scores 1 point, taking me from 4 to 5 points and extending my lead
2. Adds BLACK=2 bonus, bringing me closer to Noble N3 (requires BLACK=4,WHITE=4)
3. Costs only 1 gold token while preserving my remaining tokens (G1,R1) for flexibility
4. Blocks opponent from this 1-point card (though it's in my reserve, preventing them from reserving it)
5. More efficient than taking tokens (which delays scoring) or reserving another card (no immediate points)

Alternative options:
- Taking B,B tokens: Would give me B3 total but delays scoring while opponent could catch up
- Purchasing L1_39 or L1_1: 0 points, not impactful enough
- Reserving another card: Would only give 1 gold and no immediate point gain
- Purchasing L2_69: Cannot afford (requires BLACK=4, I have 0 black tokens)

The purchase of L2_41 is optimal because it maximizes immediate point gain while efficiently using my gold token and maintaining token flexibility for future purchases (including L2_69 which will need black tokens).
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_41]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_41
Reasoning: I am leading 4-3 but opponent has G3 bonus which makes L2_63 (cost G5, 2pts) extremely dangerous for them - they would only need G2 more tokens to purchase it and reach 5 points with G4 bonus. Currently board shows G=2 tokens available, so they could acquire the needed GREEN in one turn. Reserving L2_63 now blocks their most efficient path to 5+ points while securing me a 2-point card I can afford in 2 turns (I have G2 tokens now, need G2 more). My other reserved cards L2_41 (1pt) and L2_69 (2pts) are both too expensive currently without more tokens, and taking tokens now would allow opponent to take L2_63 next turn. This block is critical to maintain my lead and prevent opponent from accelerating their economy toward nobles N2 (RED+GREEN) or N1/N3.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_1, which is currently available for zero token cost as its requirements (1 White, 1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red) are fully satisfied by my existing bonuses (White: 2, Blue: 2, Green: 3, Red: 1). This purchase is strategically sound as it adds a second Black bonus to my engine without depleting my token supply. Strengthening my Black bonuses now will significantly lower the future cost of prestige cards like L2_66 or L2_56, and moves me closer to fulfilling the requirements for the N3 noble (4 Black, 4 White).

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=2}
Reasoning: I have 4 prestige points (leading 4-3) and 5 tokens: G2,R1,GOLD=2. My reserved cards are L2_41 (1pt), L2_69 (2pt), and L2_63 (2pt). 

**Key Analysis:**
1. **Immediate Purchase Available**: L2_63 costs G5. With my G1 bonus, I need to pay G4. I have G2 tokens + G2 gold = G4. I can purchase L2_63 RIGHT NOW.
2. **Opponent Threat**: Opponent has G3 bonus and could take G2 from the board to buy a 2-point card, reaching 5 points. I must maintain my lead.
3. **Score Acceleration**: I'm at turn 19 with only 4 points. I need to score aggressively. Buying L2_63 gives me 2 points immediately (4→6).
4. **Token Efficiency**: Using my 2 gold now is optimal. If I delay, I'll waste future token draws when I'm at max capacity.
5. **Post-Purchase Position**: After buying, I'll have R1 token left (0 gold). Next turn I can take 3 different colors without returns, maintaining flexibility.
6. **Bonus Diversification**: L2_63 adds GREEN bonus (G→2), bringing me closer to noble N2 (R4,G4).

**Alternative Evaluation:**
- Taking tokens: Delays scoring while opponent threatens to reach 5 points.
- Other purchases: L2_41 needs 3 gold (I have 2). L2_69 needs B4 tokens (I have 0). Neither is possible now.

**Decision**: Purchase L2_63 to secure 2 points, maintain lead, and efficiently use resources. This scores immediately while preventing opponent from overtaking me next turn.

Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am taking White, Blue, and Red tokens to transition from engine building to point acquisition. My current bonuses (White: 2, Blue: 2, Green: 3, Red: 1, Black: 2) place me in a strong position to begin purchasing level 2 prestige cards. By taking these specific tokens, I will be able to afford either L2_66 (1 point) or L2_54 (1 point) on my next turn, as they require exactly one additional Blue token and one or two additional Red tokens respectively. This move also begins the accumulation of White and Red tokens needed for high-value targets like L2_56 (2 points) or L3_78 (5 points), which are necessary to secure a lead over my opponent.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current game state analysis: I lead 6-3 with a strong bonus spread (W2,B1,G2,B1) but only 1 RED token. My path to victory involves purchasing L2_69 (2pts, RED bonus) for which I need BLACK tokens. Critically, opponent can purchase either L2_54 or L2_66 this turn, gaining 1 point and valuable bonuses. However, blocking them would require reserving a 1-point card that would slow my momentum toward higher-value targets. The most efficient path is to focus on my 2-point L2_69: taking 2 BLUE tokens now (B2) puts me at 3 total tokens, and taking 2 more BLUE next turn allows me to purchase L2_69 for 2 points (total 8) and acquire the RED bonus I lack. This is faster than taking 3 different colors or reserving a blocking card. Taking 2 BLUE tokens is valid (B3 available on board) and requires no returns. This maintains my lead while efficiently building toward my next 2-point purchase and diversifying my bonuses for noble competition.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLUE tokens: only 3 available (need 4).
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 6 prestige points (leading 6-3), 0 tokens, and two valuable reserved cards. My bonuses are WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=2, BLACK=1. 

**Immediate Goals:**
1. L2_41 (reserved, 1pt): After bonuses, costs only WHITE=1, BLUE=1 - extremely cheap and gives BLACK bonus
2. L2_69 (reserved, 2pt): After bonuses, costs BLACK=4 - moderate cost for 2 points and RED bonus
3. L3_78 (board, 5pt): After bonuses, costs WHITE=5, BLUE=2 - expensive but high value

**Token Availability:** Board has WHITE=2, BLUE=3, BLACK=3, GREEN=4. I can only take 3 different colors or 2 GREEN (only color with 4+ available).

**Strategic Decision:** I have 0 tokens, so I must build my economy. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK directly supports both my reserved cards:
- WHITE and BLUE enable L2_41 purchase next turn (only need 1 more BLUE token)
- BLACK builds toward L2_69 (need 3 more BLACK tokens)
- This positions me to score 3 points from reserves alone (6→9 points)

**Opponent Assessment:** Opponent has 3 points, G3 bonus, and could threaten Level 3 cards later, but no immediate win condition. Building my token economy now is higher priority than blocking.

**Conclusion:** Take 3 different colored tokens (WHITE, BLUE, BLACK) to efficiently progress toward my reserved cards and maintain lead.

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am currently at 3 prestige points while my opponent is at 6. To close this gap and secure a path to victory, I am prioritizing high-value level 3 cards. Card L3_83 offers 3 prestige points and its cost (5 White, 3 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Black) is nearly covered by my current bonuses (2W, 2B, 1R, 2BK) and token supply (2W, 1B, 2R, 1BK). Specifically, I am only one White token short of the 3 required. By reserving L3_83 now, I secure the card from my opponent and obtain a gold token. This gold token will act as the final White token needed, allowing me to purchase the card on my next turn. This move will bring me to 6 points and provide a fourth Green bonus, fulfilling half of the requirement for the N2 noble (4 Red, 4 Green). This strategy is more efficient for point accumulation than purchasing available 1-point cards (L2_54, L2_66) or 0-point engine builders this turn.

Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current state analysis: I have 6 prestige points (leading 6-3) and 4 tokens (W=1,B=1,R=1,Bk=1). My reserved cards are L2_41 (1pt, BLACK bonus) and L2_69 (2pt, RED bonus).

**Key Analysis:**
1. **Immediate Purchase Available**: L2_41 costs W3,B2,G2. With my bonuses (W=2,B=1,G=2), I need to pay W=1,B=1. I have exactly these tokens available.
2. **Scoring Priority**: Buying L2_41 immediately scores 1 point, taking me from 6→7 points and extending my lead. At turn 21, I need to maintain scoring momentum toward the 15-point goal.
3. **Economy Improvement**: L2_41 adds BLACK bonus (Bk→2), which strengthens my position for noble N3 (Bk4,W4) and future purchases like L2_69 (cost Bk5).
4. **Token Efficiency**: This purchase uses 2 tokens productively, leaving me with R=1,Bk=1. I stay well under the 10-token limit.
5. **Alternative Evaluation**: 
   - Taking tokens would delay scoring while opponent (3pts) builds toward Level 3 cards
   - Reserving another card would require discarding a valuable reserved card and provides no immediate points
   - No Level 1 purchases score points, and Level 2/3 cards on board are unaffordable
6. **Post-Purchase Position**: After buying L2_41, I'll be at 7 points with bonuses W=2,B=1,G=2,Bk=2. I can then focus on collecting BLACK tokens for L2_69 (needs Bk=4, I'll have Bk=2) or building toward Level 3 cards like L3_77 (4pts) or L3_78 (5pts).

**Decision**: Purchase L2_41 now for immediate scoring, improved economy, and maintained strategic flexibility.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I can now afford card L3_83, which I reserved on my previous turn. Its cost is 5 White, 3 Blue, 3 Red, and 3 Black. With my current bonuses (2W, 2B, 3G, 1R, 2BK) and tokens (2W, 1B, 2R, 1BK) plus one gold token acting as the final White token, I meet the requirements exactly. Purchasing this card grants me 3 prestige points, bringing my total to 6, and adds a fourth Green bonus to my engine. This move is crucial for closing the point gap with my opponent and puts me one step closer to the N2 noble (4 Red, 4 Green).

======================================================================================

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current state: I have 7 prestige points (leading 7-6) with only 2 tokens (R=1,Bk=1). My reserved L2_69 requires BLACK=3 tokens (cost Bk5 - Bk2 bonus). Board shows Bk=3 available. 

Strategic analysis:
1. **Immediate Goal**: Acquire L2_69 for 2 points to reach 9 total. I need Bk=2 more tokens.
2. **Token Selection**: Taking WHITE, BLUE, BLACK gives me diversity toward future Level 3 purchases while building BLACK for L2_69.
3. **Level 3 Preparation**: All visible Level 3 cards need BLUE (L3_78, L3_77, L3_86, L3_84). Acquiring BLUE now is strategic.
4. **Opponent Threat**: Opponent has 6 points and G=4 bonus. They could purchase L2_66 next turn if they take B,R,Bk. While I cannot fully block this, building my economy is higher priority than token denial.
5. **Noble Position**: I'm closer to N3 (Bk4,W4) with Bk=2,W=2. Taking W and Bk helps.
6. **Turn Efficiency**: This builds toward L2_69 purchase next turn while maintaining flexibility for Level 3 cards.

Final token count: Starting with R=1,Bk=1, taking W=1,B=1,Bk=1 gives me 5 total tokens (under limit), positioning me to buy L2_69 when I acquire one more BLACK.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am focusing on acquiring card L2_66, which provides 1 prestige point and a Red bonus. This Red bonus is essential for progressing toward the N2 noble (4 Red, 4 Green), as I already have the 4 Green bonuses required. The cost for L2_66 is 3 Blue, 2 Red, and 3 Black. With my current bonuses (2 Blue, 1 Red, 2 Black), I only need 1 Blue, 1 Red, and 1 Black token to make the purchase. All three colors are currently available in the board's bank. Taking these tokens now secures the ability to purchase L2_66 on my next turn, furthering my score and my engine toward a noble victory.

======================================================================================

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: Current state: 7 points vs opponent 6 points, leading but close. Reserved L2_69 (2pts) costs BLACK=5, I have BLACK bonus=2, so need 3 black tokens to purchase. Currently have 2 black tokens, board has 1 black token available. 

**Strategic Priority**: Secure the final black token NOW before opponent takes it, enabling L2_69 purchase next turn for 2 points (7→9). This also denies opponent a key token they need for L2_66 (costs Bk=3) and L2_54 (costs Bk=3).

**Token Selection**: Taking WHITE and BLUE in addition to BLACK serves multiple purposes:
1. WHITE: Need 4-5 more for Level 3 cards (L3_78:5pts, L3_77:4pts), board has W=3 available
2. BLUE: All Level 3 cards require BLUE (3 needed each), opponent has B=2 bonus and likely wants blue, so taking one denies them
3. Stay under 10-token limit: Current 5 tokens + 3 new = 8 tokens

**Opponent Threat**: Opponent has G=4 bonus and is building toward nobles (N2: R4,G4 or N1: W4,B4). They cannot purchase any face-up cards this turn (all unaffordable). Their best move is taking tokens, so denying them BLACK and BLUE is critical.

**Next Turn Plan**: With Bk=3 tokens, I can immediately purchase L2_69 for 2 points, reaching 9 total. Remaining tokens (W=2,B=2,R=1) position me to target Level 3 cards or collect toward nobles.

**Why not other actions?**
- Buying L1 cards: 0 points, wastes tokens needed for L2_69
- Reserving: Delays scoring while opponent closes gap
- Taking 2 GREEN: Unrelated to my goals

This is the most efficient path to maintain lead and continue scoring.

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L2_66, which grants 1 prestige point and a Red bonus. This purchase is strategically sound for two reasons. First, it brings my total score to 7, matching my opponent's current score. Second, it adds a second Red bonus to my engine, moving me closer to the N2 noble requirement (4 Red, 4 Green), as I already possess the 4 Green bonuses. My current bonuses (2 Blue, 1 Red, 2 Black) combined with my token supply (1 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Black) exactly meet the cost of L2_66 (3 Blue, 2 Red, 3 Black). This move effectively uses all my current tokens to increase my score and build towards a future noble visit.

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=5}
Reasoning: **Critical Situation Analysis:**

**Score:** I have 7 points, opponent has 7 points (TIED). This is a pivotal moment.

**My Resources:** 8 tokens (W2,B2,R1,Bk3), bonuses W=2,B=1,G=2,Bk=2

**Immediate Scoring Opportunity - L2_69 (reserved):**
- Cost: BLACK=5
- My bonus: Bk=2
- Tokens needed: 3 BLACK
- I have: Bk=3 tokens
- **I can purchase L2_69 RIGHT NOW for 2 points, reaching 9 total and retaking the lead.**

**Opponent Threat:**
- Opponent has G=4 bonus and is close to noble N2 (R4,G4)
- They could score 2-3 points next turn
- Taking tokens now would allow them to potentially overtake me

**Alternative Evaluation:**
- **Level 1 cards:** All 0 points - waste of turn while tied
- **Level 2/3 cards:** L2_54, L2_56, L2_58, L2_62 are unaffordable. Level 3 cards need 2-4 more tokens of specific colors
- **Taking tokens:** Delays scoring when opponent is tied and threatening
- **Reserving:** Also delays scoring and I'd need to discard a token

**Post-Purchase Position:**
- Score: 7→9 points (regain lead)
- New bonus: RED=1 (helps toward noble N2)
- Remaining tokens: W2,B2,R1 (5 total - well under limit)
- Can target Level 3 cards or continue building economy next turn

**Decision:** Purchase L2_69 immediately. This is the only action that scores points this turn, efficiently uses my accumulated black tokens, and is essential to maintain lead in this tied game state.

======================================================================================

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I am focusing on securing the N2 noble (4 Red, 4 Green) to gain 3 prestige points. I already have the 4 Green bonuses required, so I need 2 more Red bonuses. By taking White, Red, and Black tokens, I am setting up multiple paths. One White token allows me to purchase L1_39 (Red bonus, cost 3 White) next turn. The Red and Black tokens will then allow me to purchase L1_36 (Red bonus, cost 1 White, 1 Red, 3 Black) on a subsequent turn. These two purchases will trigger the N2 noble visit, bringing my score to 10. This set of tokens also keeps high-value cards like L2_56 (2 points) and L2_58 (3 points) within reach as I prepare for the endgame.

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 9 points (leading 9-7) with 5 tokens (W2,B2,R1) and strong bonuses (W2,B1,G2,R1,Bk2). No purchases are available this turn. I need to advance toward 15 points efficiently.

**Strategic Analysis:**
1. **Target Identification**: Level 3 cards offer the fastest path to victory. L3_78 (5pts) would put me at 14 points, and L3_77 (4pts) would put me at 13 points.
2. **Cost Analysis for L3_78**: Cost W7,B3. With bonuses W2,B1, I need W5,B2 in tokens. I currently have W2,B2, so I need W3 more tokens.
3. **Cost Analysis for L3_77**: Cost W6,B3,Bk3. With bonuses W2,B1,Bk2, I need W4,B2,Bk1. I currently have W2,B2,Bk0, so I need W2,B0,Bk1.
4. **Token Availability**: Board has W=1,B=2,G=4,R=2,Bk=3. I can take 3 different colors or 2 GREEN.
5. **Opponent Threat**: Opponent has G=4 bonus and is close to noble N2 (R4,G4). They have R2,G4, need R2 more. Taking GREEN would deny them, but I need WHITE and BLACK for my strategy.
6. **Optimal Move**: Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK serves multiple objectives:
   - WHITE (1 token): Directly advances toward both Level 3 cards (need 2-3 more WHITE)
   - BLUE (1 token): All Level 3 cards require BLUE, and I already have B=2 which is sufficient for both
   - BLACK (1 token): Builds toward noble N3 (Bk4,W4) which gives 3 points
   - This combination denies opponent resources they might need for L2_66 (requires Bk, BLUE) and maintains flexibility

**Result**: After taking W,B,Bk, I'll have W3,B3,R1,Bk1 (8 tokens total). This positions me to collect 1-2 more WHITE tokens in future turns to afford a 4-5 point Level 3 card, putting me within 1-2 points of victory. This is more efficient than taking 2 GREEN which doesn't advance my primary goals, or taking other combinations that don't build toward the high-value cards.

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am currently at 7 prestige points and targeting the N2 noble (4 Red, 4 Green) to reach 10 points. I already have 4 Green bonuses and 2 Red bonuses, so I need 2 more Red bonuses. I can immediately afford card L1_39, which provides a Red bonus and costs 3 White. With my 2 White bonuses and 1 White token, I meet this cost exactly. Purchasing L1_39 now brings my Red bonus total to 3. Following this, I have 1 Black token remaining, which is the exact amount needed to purchase the other visible Red bonus card, L1_36 (Cost: 1W, 1R, 3BK; Bonuses: 2W, 2R, 2BK), on my next turn. This sequence is the fastest path to triggering the noble visit and closing the gap with my opponent, who is at 9 points.

======================================================================================

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: **Current State Analysis:**
- I have 9 prestige points (leading 9-7) with 8 tokens (W3,B3,R1,Bk1)
- My bonuses: W=2, B=1, G=2, R=1, Bk=2
- No immediate purchases available
- Need to reach 15 points efficiently

**Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Level 3 Cards** are fastest path: L3_78 (5pts → 14 total) needs 2 more WHITE; L3_77 (4pts → 13 total) needs 1 more WHITE
2. **Noble N3** (3pts: Bk4,W4) - I have Bk2,W2, need 2 more of each
3. **Noble N1** (3pts: W4,B4) - I have W2,B1, need 2 more WHITE and 3 more BLUE

**Token Availability:** Board shows W=1, B=1, G=4, R=2, Bk=2

**Opponent Threat:** Opponent (7pts) has G=4 bonus and is building toward noble N2 (R4,G4). They need 2 more RED tokens. They could also target N1 (W4,B4) with their W2,B2. I must deny them key resources.

**Optimal Token Selection:**
- **WHITE (1 token):** Directly advances toward both Level 3 cards (need 2 more WHITE for L3_78, 1 more for L3_77). Also denies opponent's N1/N3 path.
- **BLACK (1 token):** Builds toward noble N3 and denies opponent from buying L2_66 (their high-value card costing Bk3) and L2_54.
- **BLUE (1 token):** All Level 3 cards require BLUE. Denies opponent from N1 and future Level 3 purchases. I already have sufficient BLUE for Level 3 cards.

**Result:** Taking W,B,Bk gives me W4,B4,R1,Bk2 (exactly 10 tokens). This denies opponent while positioning me to collect 1-2 more WHITE tokens next turn to purchase a 4-5 point Level 3 card, putting me at 13-14 points within 2 turns. Taking GREEN would be inefficient as I don't need it for my strategy.

**Conclusion:** This is the most efficient path to victory while simultaneously denying opponent resources.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 8, Taking: 3, Returning: 0
Reasoning: Current Analysis:
- I have 9 points (leading 9-7)
- Tokens: W=3, B=3, R=1, Bk=1 (total 8)
- Bonuses: W=2, B=1, G=2, R=1, Bk=2
- Available purchase: L1_36 (RED bonus) costs only Bk=1 token
- Level 3 targets: L3_77 (4pts) needs W4,B2,Bk1; L3_78 (5pts) needs W5,B2

Strategic Priority:
1. I cannot take 3 tokens without returning 1 (8+3=11 > 10), which is inefficient per the rules.
2. Purchasing L1_36 spends 1 token productively, keeping me under the limit at 7 tokens.
3. Gaining RED bonus (R=2) advances me toward noble N2 (R4,G4).
4. This blocks opponent from buying L1_36 themselves for RED bonus.
5. Next turn, I can take W=1,B=1,Bk=1 to reach exactly 10 tokens, positioning me to purchase L3_77 for 4 points (reaching 13 total).
6. This path is more token-efficient than taking 3 tokens now and returning 1.

Decision: Purchase L1_36 now to efficiently manage tokens, improve economy, and maintain strategic flexibility.

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 7, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L1_16 for 1 prestige point. It costs 4 Red, and with my 3 Red bonuses and 1 Red token, I can afford it immediately. This move increases my score to 8, narrowing the gap with my opponent (9 points). Additionally, the Blue bonus provided by L1_16 brings my total Blue bonuses to 3. This is strategically significant because it allows me to purchase card L2_54 (1 prestige point, White bonus) for zero tokens in a future turn, as its cost is 2 White, 3 Blue, and 3 Red, all of which I will cover with bonuses. This path ensures a steady increase in points and builds toward a more powerful engine.

======================================================================================

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current state: I lead 9-8 but opponent threatens noble N2 (needs R=1). I have 7 tokens (W3,B3,R1,Bk0) and strong bonuses (W2,B1,G2,R2,Bk2). 

Strategic Analysis:
1. **Opponent Threat**: Opponent has R=3,G=4 bonuses, needs R=1 token for noble N2 (3 points). Board has R=3, so they can get it this turn, reaching 11 points.

2. **Level 3 Targeting**: 
   - L3_77 (4pts): Cost W6,B3,Bk3. With bonuses I need W4,B2,Bk1.
   - L3_78 (5pts): Cost W7,B3. With bonuses I need W5,B2.
   - I currently have W3,B3,R1,Bk0.

3. **Optimal Token Selection**: Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK serves multiple objectives:
   - WHITE: I need 2-3 more for both Level 3 cards (W5 for L3_78, W4 for L3_77)
   - BLUE: All Level 3 cards require BLUE; taking it denies opponent who has B=3 bonus
   - BLACK: Needed for L3_77 denial and builds toward noble N3 (Bk4,W4)
   - This combination positions me to buy L3_77 next turn for 4 points

4. **Next Turn Execution**: After opponent likely takes noble (reaching 11 points), I will have W4,B4,R1,Bk1 tokens, exactly enough to purchase L3_77 for 4 points, reaching 13 total. Opponent cannot afford any Level 3 cards without collecting tokens first, giving me time to win.

5. **Why Not Purchase L2_54**: Buying the 1-point card now would leave me at 10 points while opponent reaches 11 from the noble, and I'd still need multiple turns to reach 15. Taking tokens now sets up a 4-point swing that puts me at 13, within striking distance.

6. **Token Limit**: Starting with 7 tokens, taking 3 reaches exactly 10, no returns needed.

This path efficiently denies opponent resources while building toward a game-winning 4-point purchase next turn.

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: 
Current state: I'm tied 9-9 with opponent. I have exactly 10 tokens (W4,B4,R1,Bk1) and strong bonuses (W2,B1,G2,R2,Bk2).

**Immediate Game-Winning Opportunity:**
Level 3 card L3_77 costs W6,B3,Bk3. With my bonuses, I need W4,B2,Bk1 - which I have exactly in tokens. This purchase gives me 4 points, bringing my score to 13 points, putting me within 2 points of victory.

**Opponent Threat Analysis:**
Opponent has 9 points with only 1 token, but strong bonuses. They're positioned to take noble N2 (R1 needed, board has R=3) for 3 points next turn, reaching 12 points. If I delay scoring, they could overtake me.

**Alternative Options:**
- L2_58 (3pts): Costs W4, would leave me at 12 points
- L1_25 (0pts): Saves tokens but wastes a critical turn while tied
- Taking tokens: At 10 tokens, I'd have to return tokens - inefficient

**Decision:**
Purchasing L3_77 now maximizes immediate point gain (4pts), denies opponent access to this high-value card, and positions me to win within 1-2 turns. This is the most aggressive and efficient path to victory in a tied game state.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L3_77]

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: To win as efficiently as possible, I am targeting a two-turn victory. By taking 2 GREEN tokens this turn, I will be able to purchase card L3_89 next turn. L3_89 costs 3 BLUE, 6 GREEN, and 3 RED. My current engine provides 3 BLUE, 4 GREEN, and 3 RED bonuses; adding 2 GREEN tokens will meet the requirement. Purchasing L3_89 will grant me 4 prestige points and provide a RED bonus, bringing my total RED bonuses to 4. Since I already have 4 GREEN bonuses, this purchase will simultaneously trigger a visit from the N2 noble (4 RED, 4 GREEN) for an additional 3 points. This combination will launch my score from 9 to 16 in just two turns, securing the win.

======================================================================================

Turn 29 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: **Game State Analysis:** I have 13 points (Player 0), opponent has 9 points (Player 1). I am 2 points away from victory.

**Current Resources:** Tokens: W2,B2,R1,Bk0 (total 5). Bonuses: W2,B1,G2,R2,Bk2. I cannot purchase any scoring card this turn.

**Path to Victory:**
- Level 2 card L2_58 offers 3 points (reaching 16 total) and costs W6.
- With my W2 bonus, I need W4 in tokens.
- I currently have W2 tokens.
- I need exactly 2 more white tokens to purchase L2_58 next turn.

**Token Availability:** Board has W=4 tokens, which meets the requirement (4+ available) to take 2 of the same color.

**Opponent Threat Assessment:**
- Opponent has 9 points and strong bonuses (W3,B3,G4,R3,Bk2) but only 3 tokens (G2,Bk1)
- They cannot afford any Level 3 cards this turn
- Even if they take tokens, they need at least 2 more turns to afford a Level 2 or 3 card
- L2_58 requires W3 tokens for opponent (W6 - W3 bonus). They have 0 white tokens, so they cannot secure it before me

**Action Efficiency:** Taking 2 white tokens now gives me exactly what I need with no waste. I'll have 7 total tokens (under the 10 limit), allowing me to purchase L2_58 next turn for an immediate victory. Any other token combination would delay my win by requiring additional turns to collect the needed white tokens.

**Decision:** Take 2 white tokens to set up L2_58 purchase next turn for the win.

Turn 29 - Player 1's move
Points: 9, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=6, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am purchasing card L3_89 to secure a victory. The card costs 3 BLUE, 6 GREEN, and 3 RED. My current engine provides 3 BLUE, 4 GREEN, and 3 RED bonuses, and I have the 2 GREEN tokens required to cover the remaining cost. Purchasing L3_89 grants me 4 prestige points, bringing my score to 13. Furthermore, the card provides a RED bonus, which gives me a total of 4 RED and 4 GREEN bonuses. This immediately triggers a visit from the N2 noble (4 RED, 4 GREEN) for an additional 3 prestige points. My final score will be 16, crossing the victory threshold of 15 points in a single turn.
