Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Turn 1: This is the opening move. I need to establish a strong foundation for my engine. Analyzing the Level 1 cards: L1_13 (BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1 BLACK:2) and L1_29 (GREEN bonus, costs WHITE:2 BLUE:1) are cheapest at 3 tokens each. L1_8 (BLACK bonus + 1 point, costs BLUE:4) is valuable but expensive. WHITE appears in 3 of 4 Level 1 cards, making it the most versatile color. Taking WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 positions me optimally: I can pursue L1_13 (need WHITE:1 BLACK:2 - will have WHITE:1 BLACK:1), L1_29 (need WHITE:2 BLUE:1 - will have WHITE:1 BLUE:1), or contribute toward L1_8 (need BLUE:4). This gives maximum flexibility for turn 2. Looking at nobles N6, N8, and N10, all require WHITE bonuses, and BLUE/BLACK bonuses are needed for 2 of 3 nobles. My plan: acquire L1_13 or L1_29 by turn 3, then leverage that first bonus toward Level 2 cards with prestige points. Board has 4 of each color available, so this move is legal. Current tokens: 0, taking 3, no returns needed (total=3).
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 1), 0 tokens, 0 score, no bonuses. Opponent has 1 white, 1 blue, 1 black. No cards purchasable with 0 tokens. Reserves would give gold but delay token accumulation. Optimal early play: take 3 different tokens to build towards quick purchase. Target L1_13 (0 prestige, blue bonus; cost: white 1, black 2). Blue bonus valuable for L1_29 (blue 1), L2_49 (blue 3), L3_83 (blue 3), L3_84 (blue 7). Plan: Turn 1 take white 1, black 1, blue 1 (all available on board >=3). Now hold white 1, blue 1, black 1. Turn 2: take black 1 + e.g. green 1, red 1 (black board will have 2 left, ok), hold white 1, blue 1, black 2, green 1, red 1; purchase L1_13 using white 1 black 2, left with blue 1 green 1 red 1 + blue bonus. Efficient ramp to bonuses. Diversified colors also progress towards nobles like N6. No token limit issue (0+3=3 <=10). No returns needed.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 2. Current position: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 (3 tokens total). Board tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:4, RED:4, BLACK:2, GOLD:5. I cannot purchase any cards yet. The two most accessible Level 1 cards are L1_13 (BLUE bonus, costs WHITE:1 BLACK:2) and L1_29 (GREEN bonus, costs WHITE:2 BLUE:1), both requiring only 3 tokens. To afford L1_13 next turn, I need 1 more BLACK. To afford L1_29, I need 1 more WHITE. Since I must take either 3 different colors or 2 of the same color (and only GREEN and RED have 4+ for the latter option), I will take WHITE:1, BLACK:1, GREEN:1. This gives me WHITE:2, BLUE:1, BLACK:2, GREEN:1 (total 6), positioning me to purchase either L1_13 or L1_29 on turn 3. All three colors are verified available on board. L1_13's BLUE bonus is strategically superior as it helps toward nobles N6 and N8, plus Level 2 card L2_49, making it my primary target with L1_29 as backup. No token returns needed (6 < 10). This efficiently sets up my first card purchase and begins building my bonus engine.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 2), tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 (total 3). Opponent has WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:2 (total 6), can afford L1_13 (cost WHITE:1, BLACK:2) on their next turn using their WHITE:2, BLACK:2. They could also buy L1_29 (WHITE:2, BLUE:1). Original plan to take BLACK:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 then buy L1_13 next turn fails because opponent snipes L1_13 first. No current purchases possible (short BLACK for L1_13). Solution: Reserve L1_13 now to deny opponent and secure it. Receive 1 GOLD (available). New tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 4 <=10). Next turn (turn 4?), purchase reserved L1_13 using WHITE:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (GOLD substitutes 2nd BLACK). Gain BLUE bonus (0 prestige). Left with BLUE:1 + BLUE bonus. BLUE bonus key for L1_29 (BLUE:1->0), L2_49 (BLUE:3->2), L3_83 (BLUE:3->2), L3_84 (BLUE:7->6). Gold versatile joker spent productively. Prevents opponent engine start. Better than taking tokens (opponent still buys it). No token limit/return issues. Board BLACK:1 remains for opponent if needed elsewhere.

======================================================================================

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 3 analysis: Opponent just reserved L1_13 (my original target), forcing strategy adjustment. Current tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:2 (6 total). Opponent will likely purchase L1_13 on their turn 3, gaining BLUE:1 bonus.

Affordability check: L1_29 (costs WHITE:2 BLUE:1) is THE ONLY card I can purchase now - I have exactly these tokens.

Strategic evaluation:
1. Gets my first bonus (GREEN:1) to keep pace with opponent
2. Frees token space (down to 3 tokens) for efficient collection
3. GREEN bonus enables key paths:
   - L1_12 costs BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1, with bonus need only BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 (4 tokens)
   - L2_63 costs GREEN:5, with bonus need only GREEN:4 (2 points for 4 tokens)
   - Contributes toward Noble N8 (WHITE:3 BLUE:3 GREEN:3)

Progression plan:
- Turn 4: Take BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 (positions for L1_12)
- Turn 5: Purchase L1_12 (BLUE:1 bonus, 0 points)
- Turn 6+: With GREEN+BLUE bonuses, efficiently buy L2_63 or L2_49 (2 points each)

Alternative rejected: Reserve L1_8 (1 point, BLACK bonus) would deny opponent points but delays my engine and creates BLUE token scarcity issues (costs BLUE:4, only BLUE:2 available on board).

This purchase builds foundation efficiently while maintaining competitive pacing. Verified: L1_29 confirmed in face-up Level 1 cards.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 3), tokens WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (total 4). Reserved L1_13 (cost WHITE:1, BLACK:2, BLUE bonus, 0pt). Exactly as planned last turn, I can purchase it now: use WHITE:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (GOLD substitutes 2nd BLACK). After purchase: tokens left BLUE:1 (total 1), gain BLUE:1 bonus, score still 0. BLUE bonus is highly valuable for upcoming cards: reduces L1_12 (BLUE:1->0), L1_16 no direct but BLUE good; L2_49 (BLUE:3->2), L2_50 (BLUE:4->3), L3_83 (BLUE:3->2), L3_84 (BLUE:7->6). Also progresses towards nobles N6 (needs BLUE:3). No other purchases possible (e.g., L1_8 needs BLUE:4, don't have). Taking tokens now (e.g., 3 different: board allows WHITE1 BLUE1 GREEN1 or RED1 since BLACK only 1 left) would leave L1_13 vulnerable? No, it's reserved by me, safe until I buy it. But delaying buy wastes a turn; opponent can't buy it (reserved by me). Still, buying now frees up hand, gets bonus immediately for next turns. Post-buy, next turn take 3 tokens (e.g., towards another cheap card or noble progress). Opponent has GREEN:1 BLACK:2, GREEN bonus:1; they bought L1_29 already (GREEN bonus). They can afford L1_38? (W2 R2, they have no W/R). L1_8 B4 no. L1_12 B1 G3 R1: have G1 B2, short. L1_16 R4 no. So no immediate buys for them. Board BLACK:1 low, so taking BLACK risky for others. No token limit (after buy total 1<10, no returns). Optimal: Buy now to secure engine start with BLUE bonus.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {GRN=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 4 - Engine Building Phase. Current position: GREEN:1 bonus from L1_29, tokens GREEN:1 BLACK:2 (3 total). Opponent has BLUE:1 bonus from L1_13. My goal remains acquiring L1_12 (BLUE bonus, costs BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1) as my fastest path to a dual-bonus engine. With my GREEN:1 bonus, L1_12 effectively costs BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 (4 tokens). Taking BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1 this turn gives me GREEN:2, BLACK:2, BLUE:1, RED:1 (6 tokens total), positioning me to purchase L1_12 on turn 5. Verification: I will have BLUE:1, GREEN:2 (plus bonus equals GREEN:3), RED:1 which exactly matches L1_12's cost - confirmed affordable next turn. This creates GREEN:1 + BLUE:1 bonuses, opening efficient paths to Level 2 scoring cards: L2_63 (costs GREEN:5, with bonuses need only GREEN:4 for 2 points) or L2_50 (costs WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:4, I already have BLACK:2). Alternative rejected: Taking RED:2 to rush L1_16 (1 point, BLUE bonus by turn 6) sounds faster but actually delays overall scoring - after getting L1_16 I'd still need 4+ turns to accumulate GREEN:4 for L2_63, versus my plan reaching 2 points by turn 8-9. Board verification: BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:4 all confirmed available. Token math: 3 current + 3 taking = 6 total < 10, no returns needed. This executes my turn 3 plan precisely.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 4), tokens BLUE:1 (total 1), bonuses BLUE:1, score:0, purchased L1_13. Opponent tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 (total 6), bonuses GREEN:1, score:0, purchased L1_29. Opponent can buy L1_12 (cost BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1, effective GREEN:2 after bonus) exactly with their tokens, gaining BLUE bonus (0pt). No other L1 buys for them. I cannot buy anything now. Reserving L1_12 denies them but I cannot buy it next turn (need GREEN:3 RED:1 after my BLUE bonus discount; current post-reserve BLUE:1 GOLD:1, take 3 e.g. GREEN:1 RED:1 WHITE:1 -> GREEN:1 RED:1 GOLD(as GREEN): still short 1 GREEN). Inefficient, delays my progress. Better: ramp to buy L1_8 (1pt BLACK bonus, cost BLUE:4 ->3 after my bonus). Board BLUE:2. Plan: Turn 4 take BLUE:1 WHITE:1 BLACK:1 (all available >=2 except WHITE4; 3 diff colors valid). New tokens: BLUE:2 WHITE:1 BLACK:1 (total 4). Opponent buys L1_12, pays BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 (board BLUE:1->2, GREEN:1->3, RED:2->3 after their pay). Turn 5: take BLUE:1 (board 2 avail) + WHITE:1 BLACK:1 or GREEN:1 RED:1 (diversify), tokens BLUE:3 WHITE:? BLACK:? etc., buy L1_8 paying BLUE:3, gain BLACK bonus +1pt, left with other tokens + bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1 score:1. Efficient: 1pt + valuable BLACK bonus (helps L2_50 B4->3, L3_83 B3->2, L3_81 B6->5) in 2 turns. WHITE/BLACK/BLUE tokens progress toward N6 (BLACK3 WHITE3 BLUE3 bonuses). No token limit/return issues (1+3=4<=10). L1_8 safe from opponent (they need 4 BLUE tokens post-buy, have BLACK:2 no BLUE left). Superior to L1_38 (0pt RED bonus, similar speed). No deck reserve needed.

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 5 - Execute Engine Completion. Current position: GREEN:1 bonus from L1_29, tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 (6 total). This is the planned purchase turn from my turn 4 strategy. Cost verification for L1_12 (BLUE bonus, 0 points): Base cost BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1, with my GREEN:1 bonus the effective cost is BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1. My tokens match exactly: BLUE:1 checkmark GREEN:2 checkmark RED:1 checkmark - confirmed affordable and L1_12 confirmed in face-up Level 1 cards. Strategic value: (1) Completes dual-bonus engine GREEN:1 plus BLUE:1 by turn 5, (2) Reduces token count to 2 (BLACK:2 remaining), creating collection space, (3) Opens efficient scoring paths to L2_63 which costs GREEN:5 but with my GREEN bonus I need only GREEN:4 tokens for 2 points, or L2_49, (4) Progresses toward Noble N8 requirement WHITE:3 BLUE:3 GREEN:3. Next-turn plan: Begin GREEN accumulation for L2_63 purchase. Alternative rejected: Pursuing L1_8 (1 point, costs BLUE:4) would require 3+ turns of BLUE collection with only BLUE:1 on board - inefficient. Opponent threat assessment: They have WHITE:1 BLUE:2 BLACK:1 plus BLUE:1 bonus (4 tokens total), cannot afford any currently visible cards - no immediate threat. This purchase maintains the strategy outlined in turn 4, establishing the dual-bonus foundation for mid-game scoring efficiency.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, BLK=1}

No immediate purchases possible for me (L1_8 needs BLUE:4 ->3 effective, have BLUE:2 short 1). Opponent cannot buy L1_8 (needs BLUE:3 effective, have BLACK:2 no BLUE). Follow previous optimal plan: take BLUE:1 WHITE:1 BLACK:1 (board allows: BLUE:2, WHITE:3, BLACK:1). New tokens: WHITE:2 BLUE:3 BLACK:2 (total 7 <=10, no returns). Next turn (turn 7), purchase L1_8 paying BLUE:3, gain BLACK:1 bonus +1 prestige, left WHITE:2 BLACK:2 + bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:1. Progresses towards N6 (BLACK/WHITE/BLUE bonuses). BLACK bonus valuable for L2_50 (BLACK:4->3), L3_83 (BLACK:3->2), L3_81 (BLACK:6->5). L1_8 safe post-take (board BLACK:0, opponent needs BLUE:3 but has none). Alternative takes (e.g., 2 WHITE? Board WHITE:3<4 invalid; GREEN/RED less relevant). No reserve/purchase better. Efficient ramp to 1pt + dual bonuses.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 6 - Green Collection for L2_63. Analysis: I have GREEN:1, BLUE:1 bonuses with BLACK:2 tokens (2 total). Opponent has BLUE:1 bonus with WHITE:2, BLUE:3, BLACK:2 (7 tokens) - they can afford L1_8 (costs BLUE:4, with bonus needs BLUE:3) for 1 point + BLACK bonus. I cannot block this, so I execute my planned L2_63 path. Board verification: GREEN:4 available - doubling GREEN:2 is legal and most efficient. Timeline: Turn 6 take GREEN:2 gives me BLACK:2, GREEN:2 (4 tokens). Turn 7 take GREEN:2 gives BLACK:2, GREEN:4 (6 tokens). Turn 8 purchase L2_63 (costs GREEN:5, with GREEN:1 bonus need exactly GREEN:4) scores 2 points + GREEN:2 total bonus. This reaches 2 points by turn 8 versus opponent's likely 1 point. Alternative rejected: Taking RED:2 toward L1_16 (1 point, BLUE bonus) achieves same turn-8 timeline but inferior 1-point gain. Taking 3 different colors (WHITE:1, RED:1, GREEN:1) delays L2_63 to turn 9+, sacrificing tempo. The GREEN doubling path maximizes point efficiency while building toward Level 3 cards (L3_90 needs GREEN:7 + RED:3 for 5 points, with GREEN:2 bonus would need only GREEN:5 tokens). Token math verified: 2 current + 2 taking = 4 total < 10, no returns required.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 6), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:3 BLACK:2 (total 7), bonuses BLUE:1, score:0. Exactly as planned from previous turn: now able to purchase L1_8 (cost BLUE:4 ->3 effective after BLUE bonus), paying exactly BLUE:3. Gain BLACK:1 bonus +1 prestige. After purchase: tokens WHITE:2 BLACK:2 (total 4), bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:1. L1_8 still available in LEVEL_1 face-up. Opponent cannot snipe it (they have GREEN:2 BLACK:2, no BLUE; effective BLUE:3 needed after their BLUE bonus, impossible). BLACK bonus highly valuable: helps L2_50 (BLACK:4->3), L3_83 (BLACK:3->2), L3_81 (BLACK:6->5). Combined BLUE/BLACK bonuses synergize for L3_83 (BLUE:3->2, BLACK:3->2). WHITE:2 BLACK:2 post-buy progresses towards N6 (BLACK3 WHITE3 BLUE3 bonuses) and N10 (BLACK3 WHITE3 RED3). No other purchases possible/ better (e.g., L1_38 needs RED:2, don't have; higher levels too costly). Taking more tokens delays scoring and bonuses. No reserve needed (card visible and affordable now). Opponent threats minimal: cannot afford L1_38/16/18/L1_8. Post-buy, next turn take e.g., WHITE1 GREEN1 RED1 (board allows WHITE:2-? BLUE:1-0=1? board BLUE:1 now, but after my buy board BLUE:1+3? No, purchase doesn't return to board. Anyway, plan solid). No token limit issues (7-3=4<=10, no returns). Optimal: Secure 1pt + key BLACK bonus immediately.

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 7 - Critical Path Correction and L2_63 Pursuit. Current position: GREEN:2, BLACK:2 (4 tokens), bonuses GREEN:1, BLUE:1. CRITICAL REALIZATION: My turn 6 plan to take GREEN:2 twice fails because after taking GREEN:2 last turn, the board now shows only GREEN:2 remaining. To take 2 of the same color requires 4+ available on board - I CANNOT double GREEN anymore! Board verification: WHITE:2, BLUE:4, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:0. Must take 3 different colors. Target remains L2_63 (2 points, costs GREEN:5, with GREEN:1 bonus need GREEN:4 tokens). Current GREEN:2, need 2 more GREEN. Revised timeline: (Turn 7) Take GREEN:1 + two others gives GREEN:3 total, (Turn 8) Take GREEN:1 again gives GREEN:4 total, (Turn 9) Purchase L2_63 for 2 points + GREEN:2 bonus. Best token combo is GREEN:1, BLUE:1, RED:1 because: (1) GREEN:1 progresses toward GREEN:4 requirement (2) BLUE:1 provides flexibility for future purchases (3) RED:1 enables options for L1_16 or L3_90 later. After taking these: GREEN:3, BLACK:2, BLUE:1, RED:1 (7 tokens total, no returns needed). Alternative rejected: Taking RED:2 (doubled) to rush L1_16 (1 point, costs RED:4) would score only 1 point vs L2_63's 2 points in same timeline. After L2_63 purchase next turn, GREEN:2 bonus opens path to L3_90 (5 points, costs GREEN:7 RED:3, with GREEN:2 bonus need GREEN:5 RED:3) for massive point acceleration. Opponent threat check: Opponent has WHITE:2, BLACK:2 with BLUE:1 BLACK:1 bonuses (1 point scored). They cannot afford L2_63 soon (would need 3+ turns to collect GREEN:5), so no defensive reserve needed. This corrected plan gets me to 2 points by turn 9 with GREEN:2 bonus engine for endgame dominance.

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 7), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:0 BLACK:2 (total 4), bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:1. Purchased L1_13 (BLUE), L1_8 (BLACK+1pt). Opponent tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1 BLACK:2 (total 7), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:1, score:0. Board: WHITE:2 BLUE:3 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:0 GOLD:5. No immediate purchases for me. Opponent can buy L1_24 (G4 eff G3 with GREEN bonus, pay G3 exactly, gain WHITE bonus +1pt) or L1_18 (eff G1 R1 BLACK:1, pay G1 R1 BLACK:1, gain WHITE bonus 0pt). Likely L1_24 for point. To deny opponent the 1pt + valuable WHITE bonus (helps their noble/engine), reserve L1_24. Receive GOLD:1 (avail). New tokens: WHITE:2 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 5 <=10, no returns). WHITE bonus valuable for me too (L2_49 W5->4, L3_83 W5->4, nobles N6/N8/N10). Plan: Turn 8 take BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 (board allows), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 8). Turn 9: Buy L2_50 (2pt BLUE bonus, eff cost WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:3 after BLACK bonus) paying WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD(as BLACK), left BLUE:1 GREEN:1 (total 2), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. L2_50 safe from opponent (needs WHITE:2+, they have 0). Synergy: BLUE:2 bonus accelerates L3_83 (BLUE:3->1 eff), L3_84 (BLUE:7->5), L2_49 (BLUE:3->1). Progress to N10/N6. Opponent post-reserve can't buy L1_24, may buy L1_18 (0pt WHITE bonus), returning BLACK:1 (board BLACK:1), GREEN+1 R+1 but doesn't help them much. Superior to taking tokens (allows opponent 1pt) or reserving other (e.g., L1_38 0pt slower). No buys/reserves better. Efficient: deny opp pt, secure gold/engine for 2pt next next turn.

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 8 - Execute L2_63 Preparation. Current state: GREEN:3, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2 (7 tokens), bonuses GREEN:1 BLUE:1. Target: L2_63 (2 points, costs GREEN:5, with GREEN:1 bonus need GREEN:4). I need exactly 1 more GREEN. Board verification: GREEN:1, BLUE:3, RED:3 all available. Alternative considered: L1_18 is technically affordable (effective cost BLUE:0 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 with my bonuses), gives WHITE bonus and 0 points. However, purchasing it reduces my GREEN to 2, requiring 2 additional token-taking turns (turns 9-10) to reach GREEN:4 again, delaying L2_63 until turn 11. This 2-turn delay while opponent sits at 1 point is unacceptable. Taking GREEN:1 BLUE:1 RED:1 reaches GREEN:4 BLUE:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 (10 tokens total, at cap but legal, no returns needed). Turn 9 plan: Purchase L2_63 for 2 points plus GREEN:2 total bonus, overtaking opponent's 1 point. Post-purchase leaves BLUE:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 (6 tokens) with GREEN:2 bonus enabling efficient path to L3_90 (5 points, costs GREEN:7 RED:3, with bonus need only GREEN:5 RED:3). Opponent threat check: They have WHITE:2 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 with 1 point, cannot threaten L2_63 (need GREEN:5, have GREEN:0). This maintains scoring tempo advantage.

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 8), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:0 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 5), bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:1. Reserved L1_24 (GREEN:4 cost for WHITE bonus +1pt). Board tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:2 GREEN:0 RED:2 BLACK:0 GOLD:4. Opponent tokens BLUE:2 GREEN:4 RED:2 BLACK:2 (total 10), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:1, score:0. No purchases possible for me (reserved L1_24 needs GREEN:4, have 0; no face-up affordable e.g. L1_38 needs R2 have 0, L1_36 needs R1 have 0). Follow previous optimal plan: take 3 different tokens toward L2_50 purchase next turn. Board GREEN:0 unavailable (plan adjusted), take available WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:1 (all board >=2 except but valid 3 diff, each 1). New tokens: WHITE:3 BLUE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 8 <=10, no returns). Turn 9: Buy L2_50 (2pt BLUE bonus, cost WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:4 eff BLACK:3 w/ bonus), pay WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD(as BLACK), left WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (total 2), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. L2_50 safe from opponent (they have WHITE:0). Post-buy, BLUE:2 accelerates high value cards: L3_83 (BLUE:3->1, BLACK:3->2, total eff much lower), L2_49 (BLUE:3->1), L3_84 (BLUE:7->5), L3_81 (BLACK:6->5). WHITE:1 left + reserved WHITE bonus progresses N6 (BLACK:3 WHITE:3 BLUE:3) and N10 (BLACK:3 WHITE:3 RED:3). Opponent threats: Can buy L2_63 (GREEN:5 eff 4 w/ bonus, pay GREEN:4 exact -> score:2 GREEN:2 bonus) or L1_18 (eff GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 pay exact -> WHITE bonus 0pt). Likely prioritizes 2pt buy. If reserves L2_50 to snipe (possible, return 1 token for gold), suboptimal (misses own 2pt, I pivot to buy L1_36 eff WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 pay exact w/ tokens WHITE:3 RED:1 BLACK:2 -> RED bonus). Reserving L2_63 myself denies their 2pt but symmetric risk they reserve L2_50, forcing me slower (buy L1_36 0pt). Better: take ramp, secure own 2pt next (to 3pt lead), let opp 2pt max. No better reserve/deck draw (risky unknown). No token limit issues. Optimal efficiency to 3pt + engine.

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 9 - Execute L2_63 Purchase for 2 Points! Current state: GREEN:4, BLUE:2, RED:2, BLACK:2 (10 tokens at cap), bonuses GREEN:1 BLUE:1, 0 points. This is the moment I've been building toward for 5 turns! Target verification: L2_63 confirmed in Level 2 face-up cards, costs GREEN:5 base. With my GREEN:1 bonus, effective cost is exactly GREEN:4. My current GREEN:4 tokens match precisely - CONFIRMED AFFORDABLE! Strategic impact: (1) Scores 2 prestige points, overtaking opponent's 1 point to take the lead 2-1, (2) Grants GREEN bonus making my total GREEN:2 bonus, (3) Reduces token count from 10 to 6 (BLUE:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 remaining), creating collection flexibility, (4) Establishes dominant position for endgame - with GREEN:2 bonus, L3_90 (5 points, costs GREEN:7 RED:3) effectively needs only GREEN:5 RED:3 tokens, achievable in 4-5 turns for potential 7-point total. Post-purchase board analysis: GREEN:0 on board means opponent cannot pursue GREEN-heavy cards easily. Opponent threat check: They have WHITE:3 BLUE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 with BLUE:1 BLACK:1 bonuses (1 point total). They reserved L1_24 (1 point, costs GREEN:4) but with GREEN:0 on board they cannot collect GREEN efficiently - not an immediate threat. Alternative rejected: L1_18 (0 points, WHITE bonus) is affordable but sacrifices 2 turns of tempo while giving 0 points - unacceptable when I can score 2 points NOW. This purchase executes the multi-turn strategy perfectly, establishing point lead and positioning for L3_90 dominance path to 7 points total while opponent sits at 1-2 points maximum by turn 13-14.

Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 9), tokens WHITE:3 BLUE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 8), bonuses BLUE:1 BLACK:1, score:1. Reserved L1_24 (WHITE+1pt). Exactly as planned from previous turn. Can purchase L2_50 (2pt BLUE bonus, cost WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:4). Effective cost with BLACK:1 bonus: BLACK:3. Pay exactly WHITE:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD(as BLACK). Left with WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (total 2), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. L2_50 available in LEVEL_2 face-up. Opponent cannot buy it (no WHITE tokens, need WHITE:2). Superior to other options: L1_36 (0pt RED bonus, cost eff WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2, affordable but no points/engine gain). L1_38 needs RED:2 (have 1). Cannot buy reserved L1_24 (no GREEN). No high-value alternatives affordable. Taking tokens wasteful (8+3=11>10, return 1 pointless). No reserve needed (L2_50 visible/affordable now). Post-buy lead 3-2, strong engine (BLUE:2 accelerates L3_84 B7->5, L3_83 B3->1+others, L2_49/52 B3->1; BLACK:1 helps L3_81/83). Progress to N6/N10 with WHITE:1 left + future WHITE bonus. Opponent threats minimal post-buy (their score:2, bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2; can take/aim L3 but we lead). No token limit issues (pay 4 tokens, 8-4=4 but GOLD counts, anyway <=10). Optimal: Secure 2pt + key BLUE bonus immediately for efficiency to 15pt.

Reasoning: Critical Position: Opponent at 3 points (AHEAD of my 2 points) with BLUE:2 BLACK:1 bonuses from L1_13 + L1_8 (1pt) + L2_50 (2pts). They have WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (2 tokens), reserved L1_24 (1pt, costs GREEN:4) but cannot afford anything immediately. Strategic Imperative: Continue L3_90 path established in turn 9. L3_90 (5pts, costs GREEN:7 RED:3 base → GREEN:5 RED:3 effective with my GREEN:2 bonus) delivers massive 5-point gain for 7 total. Token Efficiency Analysis: Board verification GREEN:4 available. Doubling GREEN:2 (legal since 4≥4 required) is 100% more efficient than taking 3 separate colors - acquires 40% of GREEN:5 requirement in one turn versus 20% from dispersed collection. Current tokens BLUE:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 (6 total) + GREEN:2 = 8 total, no returns needed. Timeline: Turn 10 GREEN:2 → 8 tokens (GREEN:2). Turn 11 GREEN:1 RED:1 X:1 → GREEN:3 RED:3 (satisfies RED requirement!). Turns 12-14 collect GREEN:2 more while managing 10-token cap. Turn 15 purchase L3_90 → 7 points total, RED:1 bonus added. Alternative Rejected: L1_18 (0pts, WHITE bonus, affordable now costs RED:1 BLACK:1 effective) → enables L2_49 path reaching only 4 points by turn 14 vs L3_90's 7 by turn 15 - inferior by 3 points. Competitive Analysis: Opponent pursuing L1_24 needs 2-3 turns from GREEN:0 to GREEN:4. Even if they score 4pts by turn 13, my 7pts by turn 15 establishes winning tempo. The doubling move executes optimal token mathematics for the 5-point power play.

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 10), tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:1 (total 2), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. Reserved L1_24 (GREEN:4 for WHITE bonus +1pt). Opponent tokens BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 (total 8), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2, score:2. Board: WHITE:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 GOLD:5. No immediate purchases affordable (reserved L1_24 needs GREEN:4 have 0; L1_36 eff WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 have RED:0 BLACK:0; L1_18 eff BLUE:0 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:0 still need GREEN:2 RED:1 have none; others too costly). Follow previous plan progression: ramp tokens to buy reserved L1_24 for 1pt + key WHITE bonus (synergizes with BLUE:2 BLACK:1 for N6 BLACK3 WHITE3 BLUE3 / N10 BLACK3 WHITE3 RED3; reduces L3_83 W5->4, L2_49 W5->4, L3_81 W3->2). Take 3 different: WHITE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (board allows all >=1; priorities: GREEN for buy, WHITE/BLACK for nobles L3_81/83/N6/N10). New tokens: WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (total 5 <=10, no returns). Next turn (11, tokens 5): take GREEN:1 + e.g. RED:1 BLACK:1 (board post-take GREEN:1 RED:2 BLACK:1), to GREEN:2+ etc. toward G4 buy turn 12. Post-buy L1_24: score:4, bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1 WHITE:1; then pivot to L3_84 (BLUE:7->5 pay BLUEs), L3_83 (eff WHITE:5->4 BLUE:3->1 RED:3 BLACK:3->2), L2_49 (2pt BLUE:3 + W5->4 B3->1), securing nobles/pts to 15. Opponent threats: Can buy L1_18 (eff pay RED:1 BLACK:1 for WHITE bonus 0pt), gaining WHITE but no pts; cannot snipe reserved/high cards (no WHITE tokens for L2s/L3s). Our lead 3-2, engine superior (BLUE:2 vs their 1, BLACK:1 vs 0). Alternatives inferior: Other takes (e.g. GREEN RED BLUE: less WHITE/BLACK synergy); reserve L3_84 (but already reserved, risky blind draw unnecessary with plan); no deck draw/purchase better. Optimal efficiency: Ramp to immediate 1pt + WHITE bonus while progressing noble/engine threats.

Points: 2, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: T11 Critical: Direct L3_90 (5pts) vs L2_47→L3_90 (8pts). Board has only GREEN:1 left! Current tokens GREEN:2 BLUE:2 RED:2 BLACK:2 (8). L3_90 costs GREEN:5 RED:3 effective (with GREEN:2 bonus). Need GREEN:3 RED:1 more. Direct path: Take RED:1 GREEN:1 BLUE:1 (board has 2, 1, 1 available), return BLACK:1 → GREEN:3 BLUE:3 RED:3 BLACK:1 (10 total). Reaches RED:3 requirement! Need GREEN:2 more for T14-15 purchase → 7pts. Alternative L2_47 first (costs BLUE:1 RED:3 with bonuses): T12 buy for 1pt → 3pts, but spends RED:3, requiring 3-4 turns to recollect for L3_90 → 8pts by T16-17. Direct path 2-3 turns faster! GREEN scarcity hedge: If no GREEN on board T12+, reserve cards for GOLD tokens (substitute for GREEN). Opponent at 3pts, can reach 4-5pts by T15, my 7pts leads. Take RED:1 GREEN:1 BLUE:1, return BLACK:1.

Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 11), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (total 5), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. Reserved L1_24 (GREEN:4 for WHITE bonus +1pt). Board: WHITE:2 BLUE:0 GREEN:0 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:5. Opponent tokens B:3 G:3 R:3 Blk:1 (total 10), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2, score:2. No purchases affordable: L1_24 G:4 (have 1); L1_36 eff W:1 R:1 Blk:2 (Blk:3-1=2, have Blk:1<2, R:0); L1_18 eff BLUE:0 G:2 R:1 (have G:1 R:0); L1_38 W:2 R:2 (R:0); higher cards no. GREEN unavailable. Take 3 different available colors: WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 (board supplies allow). New tokens: W:3 B:1 G:1 R:1 Blk:2 (total 8 <=10, no returns). Progresses toward L1_24 (need +3G when available), enables future L1_36 (RED bonus backup eff pay W:1 R:1 Blk:2 exact), L3_83 (W:3/5->4postW B:1/1 R:1/3 Blk:2/2), L3_81, nobles N6/N10 post-WHITE bonus. Opponent post-our-take board W:1 R:0 Blk:1; at 10 tokens likely buys L2_47 (eff B:1 R:3 pay exact from holdings, +BLUE bonus +1pt to score:3, returns B:1 R:3 to board) or L1_18 (R:1 Blk:1 +WHITE 0pt). Either advances board supply (R/B back, no G). Our turn 13: ramp further toward G4 buy/engines. Superior engine (BLUE:2 BLACK:1 +WHITE soon vs opp GREEN:2 BLUE:1/+1), lead maintained. Alternatives inferior: no 2-same (no 4+ avail); reserve/ deck draw delays ramp, risks unknown (e.g., opp can't reach our high targets fast, L2_47 denial unnecessary as low pt). No token limit issues. Optimal: Ramp efficiently to secure 1pt + key WHITE bonus soon.

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 12 - Token Deadlock Resolution via GOLD Reserve Strategy. Current state: BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:1 (10 tokens at cap), bonuses GREEN:2 BLUE:1, score 2pts. Opponent at 3pts. CRITICAL PROBLEM: Board shows GREEN:0, RED:0, BLUE:0 - severe token scarcity! My L3_90 plan requires GREEN:5 RED:3 effective (with GREEN:2 bonus). I have GREEN:3 RED:3, need GREEN:2 more but GREEN:0 available on board. All token-taking paths are BLOCKED. Strategic pivot: Reserve L3_90 (5pts, costs GREEN:7 RED:3 base) to get GOLD:1 token which substitutes any color. Return BLACK:1 (least useful for L3_90). After reserve: BLUE:3 GREEN:3 RED:3 GOLD:1 (10 tokens), L3_90 in hand (protected from opponent). Timeline: (T13) Reserve another card for GOLD:2 total. (T14) Purchase L3_90 from hand: Pay GREEN:3 tokens + GOLD:2 (substitute as GREEN:2) + RED:3 tokens = GREEN:5 RED:3 effective. Score 2+5=7pts, gain RED:1 bonus. This achieves victory as opponent can reach max 4-5pts by T14. Reserving L3_90 specifically (not blind) ensures: (1) Protects my win condition from opponent (though they cannot afford it with GREEN:1 RED:1 vs GREEN:7 RED:3 needed), (2) Guarantees card availability for purchase from hand, (3) GOLD tokens break the token scarcity deadlock. Alternative rejected: Purchasing L2_47 (1pt, costs BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:3 effective) scores only 1pt to tie 3-3, and SPENDS the RED:3 needed for L3_90, requiring 3-4 turns to rebuild RED for eventual 8pts by T17-18 vs GOLD strategy's 7pts by T14. Time efficiency: GOLD path is 3 turns faster to victory. Reserve L3_90, return BLACK:1.

Turn 12 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 12), tokens WHITE:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 (total 8), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. Reserved L1_24 (GREEN:4 for WHITE+1pt). Board: WHITE:1 BLUE:0 GREEN:0 RED:0 BLACK:2 GOLD:4. Cannot TAKE_TOKENS: only WHITE/BLACK available (2 colors <3 diff), none >=4 for 2-same. Can PURCHASE L1_36 (eff W1 R1 BLACK:2 exact pay, +RED bonus 0pt), but suboptimal (0pt, allows opponent buy L2_47). Opponent analysis: tokens BLUE:3 GREEN:3 RED:3 BLACK:0 GOLD:1 (total10), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2, score:2. Can ONLY purchase L2_47 (eff BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:3 pay BLUE:1 RED:3 exact, +BLUE bonus +1pt to score:3 BLUE:2). Cannot buy others: L1_18 needs BLACK:1 (have0 eff), L1_36/38 need WHITE (0), L1_16 RED:4>3, higher no WHITE etc., reserved L3_90 GREEN:5 eff>3. Opponent cannot take (same board limits). To deny critical 1pt + BLUE bonus (ties score, matches my BLUE:2), RESERVE L2_47. Receive GOLD:1 (avail), new tokens WHITE:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total9 <=10, no returns). Synergy for me: L2_47 BLUE bonus -> BLUE:3 (perfect for N6 BLUE:3 req with future WHITE/BLACK; eff reduces L3_84 B7->4, L3_83 B3->0, L2_52 B6->3, L2_49 B3->0). Cost eff B0 G2 R3 (BLUE:3 covers B2+extra). Post-reserve, opponent cannot buy L2_47, cannot purchase/take, must RESERVE (visible or deck, get GOLD but >10 return1). They miss pt/engine, board unchanged. My plan: Maintain lead 3-2, next ramp G/R (opp returns token? but reserve returns theirs) toward buy L2_47 (need +1G +2R) or L1_24 G4 (+3G), pivot to L3_84/L3_83 with BLUE:3 engine, secure N6/N10 post-WHITE. Superior to buy L1_36 (opp ties, inferior RED bonus vs BLUE:3 synergy) or other reserves (no threats, e.g. L3_84 opp can't reach). Efficient denial + engine upgrade.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 13 - Execute GOLD Token Accumulation for L3_90 Purchase. Current state: BLUE:3 GREEN:3 RED:3 GOLD:1 (10 tokens at cap), bonuses GREEN:2 BLUE:1, score 2pts. Opponent at 3pts. Plan verification: My Turn 12 reserved L3_90 (5pts, costs GREEN:7 RED:3 base → GREEN:5 RED:3 effective with GREEN:2 bonus) to get GOLD:1. Turn 13 goal: Reserve another card for GOLD:2 total. Turn 14 plan: Purchase L3_90 using GREEN:3 + RED:3 + GOLD:2 (substitute as GREEN:2) = GREEN:5 RED:3 effective. This scores 2+5=7pts and gains RED:1 bonus. Board verification: GOLD:3 available, can reserve and get GOLD:1. Token math: Current 10 tokens + GOLD:1 = 11 (EXCEEDS CAP), must return 1 token. Return BLUE:1 (least critical for L3_90 which needs GREEN/RED). After reserve: BLUE:2 GREEN:3 RED:3 GOLD:2 (10 tokens exactly). Reserve target: L3_86 (5pts, GREEN bonus, costs BLUE:7 GREEN:3 base). Strategic value: (1) High-value follow-up card (5pts), (2) GREEN bonus stacks with my GREEN:2, (3) After purchasing L3_90 gaining RED:1 bonus (GREEN:2 RED:1 BLUE:1 total), L3_86 costs BLUE:6 GREEN:1 effective - achievable in 4-5 turns post-L3_90 for potential 12pts total. (4) Protects 5-point card from opponent (though they have BLUE:1 vs BLUE:7 needed, cannot afford). Opponent threat check: They have WHITE:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (9 tokens), can potentially purchase L1_18 (0pts, WHITE bonus) but no point gain. Even if opponent reaches 4-5pts by T15, my 7pts T14 maintains competitive position. Alternative rejected: Blind reserve from deck - less strategic than securing L3_86 explicitly. Purchasing L1_18 now - costs GOLD:1 needed for L3_90, leaves RED:2 vs RED:3 needed, blocks winning timeline. Reserve L3_86, return BLUE:1, execute Turn 14 L3_90 purchase for 7-point position.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 13), tokens WHITE:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (total 9), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. Reserved L1_24 (GREEN:4 WHITE+1pt), L2_47 (BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:3 BLUE+1pt). Board: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:0 BLACK:2 GOLD:2. Opponent: tokens BLUE:2 GREEN:3 RED:3 BLACK:0 GOLD:2 (total 10), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2, score:2. Can buy L1_36 eff W1 R1 BLACK:2 exact (pay W1 R1 BLACK:2), gaining RED bonus 0pt, left tokens ~5, but post-buy board replenishes (W+1 R+1 BLACK+2 -> WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:1 BLACK:4 GOLD:2), enabling opponent to buy L1_16 (R4 pay R3 GOLD:1 exact, +1pt BLUE bonus to score:3 BLUE:2). Ties score, opponent gains key BLUE bonus matching mine. TAKE_TOKENS inefficient (only WHITE/BLUE/BLACK avail, take 1 each +3=12>10 return 2 wasteful, e.g. return G1 R1 net +W1 B1 BLACK:1). Cannot 2-same (no 4+). Other purchases no (reserved need more G/R; L1_18 G2>1; etc.). Opponent threat: Can buy L1_16 now (R3 GOLD:1, independent of board supply) for 1pt+BLUE unless denied. RESERVE L1_16 denies it (visible L1), receive GOLD:1 (avail2, total10 no exceed), no waste. For me: L1_16 R4 cheap later (ramp R, or post RED bonus eff R3), +1pt BLUE:3 perfect for N6 (BLUE:3 req w/ future WHITE:1 BLACK:1+), L3_83 B3->0, L3_84 B7->4, L2_52 B6->3, L2_49 B3->0. Opponent fallback: buy L1_18 eff R1 BLACK:1 (pay R1 GOLD:1) for WHITE 0pt (less threat), or reserve. Maintains 3-2 lead, superior engine (BLUE:2->3 vs their 1/+maybe0), progresses plan (ramp G/R next post-opp action for L2_47/L1_24 buys, now +L1_16). No better: reserving higher risks unknown/less urgent (opp can't buy high w/o WHITE); buying L1_36 allows opp score/engine. Optimal denial + future 1pt/engine upgrade efficiency to 15pt.

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=5, RED=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Turn 14 - EXECUTE L3_90 PURCHASE FOR 7-POINT VICTORY PATH! This is the decisive moment culminating my 5-turn GOLD accumulation strategy. Current state: BLUE:2 GREEN:3 RED:3 GOLD:2 (10 tokens at cap), bonuses GREEN:2 BLUE:1, score 2pts. Opponent at 3pts with potential to reach 4pts. TARGET VERIFICATION: L3_90 confirmed in my reserved hand (card_id L3_90), costs GREEN:7 RED:3 base. AFFORDABILITY CALCULATION: With my GREEN:2 bonus, effective cost is GREEN:5 RED:3. Payment breakdown: GREEN:3 tokens + GOLD:2 tokens (substitute as GREEN:2) = GREEN:5 effective ✓, RED:3 tokens = RED:3 ✓. GOLD:2 exactly covers the GREEN:2 shortfall. CONFIRMED AFFORDABLE! Strategic impact: (1) Scores 5 prestige points → 2+5=7 total, establishing commanding 7-3 lead (or 7-4 if opponent purchases L2_47 next turn for 1pt using GREEN:1+GOLD:1 + RED:1+GOLD:1), (2) Gains RED:1 bonus → total bonuses GREEN:2 BLUE:1 RED:1, (3) Reduces token count from 10 to 2 (only BLUE:2 remaining after spending GREEN:3 RED:3 GOLD:2), creating maximum board collection flexibility, (4) Opens path to L3_86 (5pts, costs BLUE:6 GREEN:1 effective with my bonuses) for potential 12pts total endgame. Board state reality check: GREEN:0 RED:0 BLACK:2 BLUE:1 WHITE:1 GOLD:1 available - severe token scarcity makes GOLD the ONLY viable payment method for GREEN-heavy L3_90. Alternative rejected: Any token collection move is blocked by GREEN:0 RED:0 scarcity. Purchasing L1_18 (0pts, costs GREEN:0 RED:1 BLACK:1 effective with bonuses, would use GOLD:1 for BLACK) scores 0 points while delaying L3_90 to turn 15 - unacceptable tempo loss when opponent threatens 4pts. The 5-turn plan executed flawlessly: Turn 12 reserved L3_90 (GOLD:1), Turn 13 reserved L3_86 (GOLD:2 total), Turn 14 PURCHASE L3_90 using accumulated GOLD to bypass token deadlock. This purchase delivers 7-point position with 3-4 point lead, positioning for victory. Execute L3_90 purchase!

Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 14), tokens WHITE:3 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:2 (total 10), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1, score:3. Reserved L1_24(G4 WHITE+1pt), L2_47(BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:3 BLUE+1pt), L1_16(RED:4 BLUE+1pt).

At 10 tokens, TAKE_TOKENS wasteful (return=net 0). No reserved purchases affordable (L2_47 needs GREEN:2 RED:3 equiv, have GREEN:1 RED:1 GOLD:2 = GREEN:2 RED:2 equiv short 1 RED; others worse). Visible affordable: L1_36 (cost WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:3 eff BLACK:2 pay exact WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2; +RED bonus 0pt). Post-buy: tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:0 BLACK:0 GOLD:2 (total 6), bonuses BLUE:2 BLACK:1 RED:1; board WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:4 BLACK:4 GOLD:3 (returns WHITE:1 RED:1 BLACK:2). Next turn (15): TAKE_TOKENS 2 RED (4+ avail), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:2 GOLD:2 (total 8); PURCHASE L2_47 eff BLUE:2(cov) GREEN:2 RED:3-1=2 pay GREEN:1+GOLD:1(as GREEN) RED:2 exact. Post: WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GOLD:0 (total 3? Wait 4 earlier miscalc but <=10), score:4, bonuses BLUE:3 RED:1 BLACK:1.

Then ramp GREEN:4 for L1_24 +1pt WHITE:1 (nobles L3_81/83/N6/N10), or L1_16 +1pt BLUE:4; target L3s/nobles to 15 fast. Opponent from 0 tokens ramps slow for B6 G1 (board BLUE:1 low), unlikely beat us despite 7-4. Alternatives inferior: L1_18 WHITE bonus (pay GREEN:2 RED:1 eff, board post GREEN:4 RED:4 BLACK:2 no BLACK return; next 2 GREEN possible but delays RED for L2_47/L1_16); L1_34 RED (pay WHITE:2 GREEN:1, board RED:3<4 no 2-RED); reserve wastes return. No pt cards affordable. Optimal efficiency: Bonus + space to secure 1pt/BLUE:3 next, superior engine to close 7pt gap/preempt opp.

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1}
Reasoning: Turn 15 Strategic Analysis - Intermediate Target Pivot: Current position 7pts (BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 bonuses, 2 tokens) vs opponent 3pts. My reserved L3_86 (5pts, costs BLUE:6 GREEN:1 effective) requires BLUE:4 more tokens, but board shows critical BLUE:1 scarcity - direct path would take 4-5 turns minimum given token shortage. CRITICAL PIVOT: Target L2_62 (2pts, GREEN bonus, costs BLUE:5 GREEN:3 base → BLUE:4 GREEN:1 effective with bonuses) as intermediate milestone - achievable in 2-3 turns vs 4-5 for L3_86. Strategic cascade value: Purchasing L2_62 yields (1) 9pts total maintaining commanding lead, (2) GREEN bonus upgrade GREEN:2→GREEN:3, (3) Transforms L3_86 cost from BLUE:6 GREEN:1 to BLUE:6 GREEN:0 effective (GREEN:3 bonus fully covers GREEN:3 cost!), simplifying endgame to pure BLUE collection. Immediate action: Board verification WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:4 BLACK:4 GOLD:3 available. Take BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (legal 3-different-colors rule, board supply confirmed). Result tokens BLUE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (5 total, no returns needed). Token selection rationale: BLUE:1 critical for L2_62 progress (33% of BLUE:4 need), GREEN:1 satisfies L2_62's GREEN:1 requirement completely, BLACK:1 over RED:1 because post-game Level 3 cards (L3_82 costs BLACK:7, L3_81 costs BLACK:6 vs RED:2) heavily favor BLACK accumulation - BLACK appears in 6-7 quantities while RED maxes at 2-3. Timeline execution: T15 collect these 3→(BLUE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:1). T16 collect BLUE:1 more (if restocked) or GOLD reserve→(BLUE:4 GREEN:1). T17 purchase L2_62→9pts, GREEN:3 bonus achieved. T18-21 collect BLUE:6 for simplified L3_86. T22 purchase L3_86→14pts. T23 final 1pt card→15pts WIN. Opponent check: They have tokens for L1_18 (costs GREEN:2 effective, scores 0pts) but no scoring threat this turn. 4-point lead maintained. Execute token collection to advance fastest scoring timeline.

Cannot buy others (no W for L1_38/34/2). No denial needed (L1_18 WHITE less threat than our BLUE:3 progression). Alternatives inferior: Buy L1_18 now (+WHITE, pay G1 GOLD1 eff G2, board returns enable 2R next but post-buy G0 delays L2_47 GREEN); buy L1_34 (+RED:2 dup, pay W2 G1); reserve wastes GOLD no progress; 3-diff take (e.g. W1 G1 Blk1) slower RED ramp; no reserved/pt buys affordable (L2_47/L1_16 short RED equiv). Optimal efficiency: Precise ramp to immediate 1pt + BLUE:3 engine upgrade, superior path to 15/preempt opp.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 16 - BLUE Token Scarcity Deadlock, GOLD Reserve Strategy Required. Current state: 7pts, tokens BLUE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (5 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1. Target remains L2_62 (2pts, GREEN bonus, costs BLUE:5 GREEN:3 base → BLUE:4 GREEN:1 effective with bonuses). I have BLUE:3 GREEN:1, need BLUE:1 more. CRITICAL PROBLEM: Board shows BLUE:0 - cannot take BLUE tokens directly! This mirrors Turn 12-13 deadlock that GOLD strategy solved. Solution: Reserve L3_84 (4pts, GREEN bonus, costs BLUE:7) for GOLD:1 token. Token math: 5 current + GOLD:1 = 6 tokens (no returns needed). Timeline execution: (T16) Reserve L3_84 → BLUE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1. (T17) Purchase L2_62 using BLUE:3 tokens + GOLD:1 (substitute as BLUE) + GREEN:1 token = BLUE:4 GREEN:1 effective cost satisfied → Score 7+2=9pts, gain GREEN bonus → GREEN:3 total. (T18+) With GREEN:3 bonus, L3_86 costs BLUE:6 GREEN:0 effective (GREEN:3 fully covers GREEN:3 cost). Collect BLUE:6 over 3-4 turns → Purchase L3_86 for 14pts → Final 1pt card for 15pts WIN. L3_84 reserve benefits: (1) Obtains GOLD:1 to bypass BLUE:0 scarcity, (2) Protects 4pt card (opponent has BLUE:1 token + BLUE:2 bonus vs BLUE:7 cost - unaffordable), (3) Provides future option (GREEN bonus card fits BLUE/GREEN engine), (4) Alternative to L3_86 if needed. Opponent threat assessment: 3pts, can purchase L2_47 (1pt, costs BLUE:0 GREEN:2 RED:2 effective, has GREEN:1 RED:2 GOLD:2) or L1_16 (1pt, costs RED:3 effective, has RED:2 GOLD:1) next turn → 4pts max. My 9pts T17 maintains 5-point cushion. Alternative rejected: Purchase L1_18 (0pts, affordable with bonuses) wastes turn scoring 0pts. Taking tokens doesn't address BLUE shortage. Reserve L3_84 executes proven GOLD accumulation pattern.

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 7, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 17 - EXECUTE L2_62 PURCHASE FOR 9-POINT POSITION! This is the critical intermediate milestone following my Turn 16 GOLD reserve strategy. Current state: 7pts, tokens BLUE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (6 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1. TARGET VERIFICATION: L2_62 confirmed on board (card_id L2_62), 2pts prestige, GREEN bonus, costs BLUE:5 GREEN:3 base. AFFORDABILITY CALCULATION: With my BLUE:1 bonus, effective BLUE cost is 4. With my GREEN:2 bonus, effective GREEN cost is 1. Payment breakdown: BLUE:3 tokens + GOLD:1 token (substitute as BLUE) = BLUE:4 effective checkmark, GREEN:1 token = GREEN:1 effective checkmark. CONFIRMED AFFORDABLE! Strategic impact: (1) Scores 2 prestige points yields 7+2=9 total, maintaining commanding 5-point lead over opponent's 4pts, (2) Gains GREEN bonus yields GREEN:2+1=GREEN:3 total bonuses, (3) CRITICAL TRANSFORMATION: L3_86 (5pts, costs BLUE:7 GREEN:3 base) now costs BLUE:7 GREEN:0 effective with my GREEN:3 bonus fully covering the GREEN:3 requirement! Endgame is now simplified to pure BLUE token collection, (4) Token state after purchase: BLACK:1 only (1 token total), creating maximum board collection flexibility. Opponent threat check: 4pts, cannot score this turn (L1_24 reserved needs GREEN:4 effective, they have GREEN:0+GOLD:1 insufficient; L1_16 reserved needs RED:3 effective, they have RED:0+GOLD:1 insufficient). My 9-4 lead is secure. Timeline execution confirmed: T15 collected BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1, T16 reserved L3_84 for GOLD:1, T17 PURCHASE L2_62 yields 9pts + GREEN:3 bonus achieved! Next phase: T18-21 collect BLUE:7 tokens for L3_86, T22 purchase L3_86 yields 14pts, T23 final 1pt card yields 15pts WIN. This purchase executes the planned intermediate milestone perfectly, upgrading engine for simplified endgame. Execute L2_62 purchase!

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 18 - Begin BLUE:6 Collection for L3_86 Endgame. Current state: 9pts, BLACK:1 token only, bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1, commanding 5-point lead over opponent's 4pts. Target: L3_86 (5pts, costs BLUE:7 GREEN:3 base → BLUE:6 GREEN:0 effective with GREEN:3 bonus fully covering GREEN cost) for 14pts, then final card for 15pts WIN. CRITICAL CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION: Board shows BLUE:3 available (< 4 required for taking 2 of same color), cannot take BLUE:2 directly. GOLD tokens unavailable via TAKE_TOKENS (no take_GOLD field in schema, only obtainable through reserving). Must collect BLUE:6 via BLUE:1 per turn over multiple turns. TURN 18 ACTION: Take BLUE:1 + GREEN:1 + BLACK:1 (3 different colors, legal per rules). Token math verified: Current BLACK:1 + (take BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1) = result BLACK:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 (4 tokens total, well under 10 cap, no returns needed). Color selection rationale: (1) BLUE:1 essential progress toward BLUE:6 requirement (1/6 collected), (2) GREEN:1 from plentiful GREEN:4 board supply, (3) BLACK:1 from BLACK:3 supply for token diversity. Timeline projection: T18-T23 accumulate BLUE:6 through BLUE:1+2others each turn, T24 purchase L3_86 → 14pts, T25-T26 collect for final card, T27 reach 15pts WIN. Opponent threat assessment: Can purchase L1_16 reserved (costs RED:4-1=RED:3 effective with RED:1 bonus, has RED:2+GOLD:1=RED:3 available) for 5pts this turn. My 9-5 or 9-4 lead remains commanding - opponent needs 11+ points in 9 remaining turns (nearly impossible). Alternative rejected: Purchase L1_18 now (costs BLUE:1-1+GREEN:2-3+RED:1-1+BLACK:1=BLACK:1 effective with bonuses, affordable with my BLACK:1) gains WHITE bonus but scores 0pts, resets tokens to 0, wastes turn without accelerating BLUE:6 collection for decisive L3_86 purchase. Execute BLUE accumulation!

Points: 4, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 18), tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:2 BLACK:0 GOLD:1 (total 6), bonuses BLUE:3 RED:1 BLACK:1, score:4. Reserved L1_24(G4 WHITE+1pt), L1_16(R4 BLUE+1pt). Board: WHITE:2 BLUE:2 GREEN:3 RED:2 BLACK:2 GOLD:4.

Reserve wastes turn no progress. No opp immediate threats (low tokens cannot buy L3_88 eff G4 need ramp; L1s need W/G they lack; no nobles). Optimal: Secure 1pt + BLUE:4 engine immediately, superior path to 15/preempt opp.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=4, RED=1, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 19 - Continue BLUE Accumulation for L3_86 Endgame. Current state: 9pts, tokens BLUE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:2 (4 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1, commanding 4-point lead over opponent's 5pts. Target remains L3_86 (5pts, costs BLUE:7 GREEN:3 base → BLUE:6 GREEN:0 effective with GREEN:3 bonus) for 14pts total. Progress: Turn 18 collected BLUE:1, now need BLUE:5 more tokens for L3_86 purchase (currently 1/6 collected). BOARD CONSTRAINT CHECK: BLUE:2 available (< 4 required for same-color double-take rule per game rules). Cannot take BLUE:2 directly. Must take BLUE:1 via 3-different-colors rule. TURN 19 ACTION: Take BLUE:1 + GREEN:1 + RED:1 (3 different colors, legal per rules). Board supply verified: BLUE:2✓, GREEN:3✓, RED:4✓ all available. Token math: Current 4 + take 3 = 7 total (well under 10 cap, no returns needed). Result tokens: BLUE:2, GREEN:2, BLACK:2, RED:1. COLOR SELECTION RATIONALE: (1) BLUE:1 essential progress → 2/6 toward BLUE:6 requirement for L3_86, (2) GREEN:1 strategic multipurpose: matches my GREEN:3 bonus engine color, brings total to GREEN:2 providing flexibility for future purchases, contributes toward potential L3_88 endgame (costs GREEN:7 → GREEN:3 effective with future GREEN:4 bonus after L3_86), (3) RED:1 over WHITE:1 because RED:4 board supply stronger than WHITE:2, and RED tokens maintain diversity without committing to WHITE-heavy card paths that require 4-5+ WHITE tokens I don't currently have. ALTERNATIVE REJECTED: Purchase L1_18 (0pts, WHITE bonus, costs BLACK:1 effective with bonuses) available and affordable with my BLACK:2. Rejection reasoning: Scores 0 points, WHITE:1 bonus doesn't accelerate critical BLUE:6 collection path for L3_86, wastes turn without meaningfully advancing toward 15-point victory goal. WHITE bonus reduces costs for L2_49/L2_45/L2_58/L3_81/L3_82/L3_83, but these cards require 2-7 WHITE tokens (would take 2-4 additional collection turns) or heavy BLACK/other requirements - does not provide faster path than L3_86→final card route. OPPONENT THREAT ASSESSMENT: 5pts, tokens WHITE:2 BLUE:1 (3 total), bonuses BLUE:4 RED:1 BLACK:1. Cannot score this turn: L1_24 reserved costs GREEN:4 (has GREEN:0), visible Level 2/3 cards unaffordable. My 9-5 lead secure for at least 2 more turns. TIMELINE PROJECTION: T19 collect BLUE:1→(BLUE:2/6). T20 collect BLUE:1→(BLUE:3/6). T21 collect BLUE:1 or reserve for GOLD→(BLUE:4/6). T22 collect BLUE:1→(BLUE:5-6/6). T23 purchase L3_86→14pts. T24-25 collect tokens for 1-2pt final card. T26-27 purchase final card→15pts WIN. Execute BLUE:1 GREEN:1 RED:1 collection!

Post L1_16 buy (BLUE:4 +1pt score5). Tokens low3 ideal ramp to L1_24 G4 WHITE+1pt (score6). Board GREEN:2<4 cannot 2G, so TAKE_TOKENS 3 diff: WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 (all avail >=1). Post: tokens WHITE:3 BLUE:2 GREEN:1 (total6 <=10, no return). Ramps G1 toward4, W3 tokens for future W5 pays (e.g. L3_83/L2_49 eff post-W bonus), B2 minor. Board post: WHITE:1 BLUE:0 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:2 GOLD:5. Enables turn21 ramp G further (take GREEN:1 + e.g. RED:1 BLACK:1 if avail), toward G4 buy turn21 or22. Then score6 W bonus, unlocks noble progress/ramp e.g. L2_58 W6 eff5 postW? No first pts.

Opp threats: Can buy L1_18 eff ~Blk1 pay Blk1 (get WHITE bonus), score9 no pt gain but W bonus toward N8 (post W1 B1 G3 short); board post-our B0 prevents opp take B. Cannot buy much else (no W tokens for L1_38/34/2; L3_88 G4 eff pay G4 have2 short; L2s W5 no). Likely buy L1_18 or take tokens (3diff e.g. G1 W1 R1 since G1 W1 avail post-our). Even if takes G1, we ramp other/alt path (e.g. deny L3_88 reserve it? But low pri). Our BLUE:4 engine superior for B-heavy visible (L2_49/52 cov, L3_83 B0), opp G3 slow for B6 reserved (board B0 post-our hampers). No purchases/reserves affordable/useful now (L1_24 short G4; no vis pt buyable as W-short heavy; reserve e.g. L2_52 B6 eff B2 but delays ramp GOLD1 minor vs G progress). Alts inferior: take G1 R1 Blk1 (no W ramp); take no G delays L1_24. Optimal: Ramp G1 + W3 tokens precisely toward L1_24 1pt/W bonus + future pays, superior path to 15/preempt opp.

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Turn 20 Strategic Analysis - BLUE Shortage Crisis, L3_88 Alternative Path: Current state 9pts, tokens BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 (7 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1, commanding 4-point lead over opponent's 5pts. CRITICAL PROBLEM: Board shows BLUE:0 available - second BLUE shortage crisis (mirrors Turn 16). Cannot collect BLUE tokens to pursue L3_86 path (requires BLUE:6 effective, I have BLUE:2, need BLUE:4 more). STRATEGIC PIVOT: Target L3_88 (4pts, RED bonus, costs GREEN:7 base → GREEN:4 effective with my GREEN:3 bonus) as alternative scoring route. Key advantages: (1) Board has GREEN:1 available NOW (vs BLUE:0), (2) I have GREEN:2 tokens, only need GREEN:2 more tokens for L3_88, (3) GOLD can substitute providing flexibility. Timeline execution: T20 reserve L3_88 → gain GOLD:1 → tokens BLUE:2 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:1 (8 total). T21 take GREEN:1 (board has GREEN:1) + WHITE:1 RED:1 → GREEN:3 GOLD:1 total. T22 purchase L3_88 using GREEN:3 tokens + GOLD:1 (substitute as GREEN) = GREEN:4 effective cost satisfied → score 9+4=13pts, gain RED bonus → bonuses become BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2. T23-25 collect tokens for 2pt final card (L2_49 or L2_45), T26 purchase → 15pts WIN. L3_88 path achieves 13pts by T22 (versus L3_86 path blocked indefinitely by BLUE shortage). Reserve benefits: obtains GOLD:1 immediately, protects 4pt card from opponent (has GREEN:1 vs GREEN:7 cost unaffordable), establishes faster scoring timeline, bypasses BLUE:0 crisis. Opponent 5pts cannot score this turn (L1_24 reserved needs GREEN:4 has GREEN:1 only), 4-point lead maintained. Alternative rejected: taking tokens hits 10 cap without solving shortage, purchasing L1_18 (0pts WHITE bonus) wastes turn without advancing victory goal.

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {BLU=3, GRN=5, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Execute Turn 20 plan to accumulate GREEN:1 for L3_88 purchase. Taking GREEN:1 + BLUE:1 + RED:1 brings me to GREEN:3 + GOLD:1 = GREEN:4 effective, making L3_88 affordable next turn for 4 points. Including BLUE:1 provides backup progress toward L3_86 (BLUE:2→3 vs BLUE:6 needed). Including RED:1 maintains token diversity (RED:1→2). Token math: current 8 + take 3 = 11 tokens, return BLACK:1 to reach 10-token limit. Result tokens: BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1. Timeline: T21 collect tokens, T22 purchase L3_88 using GREEN:3 + GOLD:1 → score 13pts total, gain RED:2 bonus, T23-25 collect tokens for final 2pt card (L2_49 or L2_45), T26 reach 15pts WIN. Opponent at 8pts cannot score this turn (L1_24 reserved needs GREEN:4, has GREEN:1 only; board cards unaffordable with WHITE:3 + GREEN:1). My 9-8 narrow lead maintained, on track for victory through L3_88 path.

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 9, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=6, RED=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 22 - EXECUTE L3_88 PURCHASE FOR 13-POINT COMMANDING POSITION! This executes my Turn 20-21 planned strategy. Current state: 9pts, tokens BLUE:3 GREEN:3 RED:2 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (10 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:1. TARGET VERIFICATION: L3_88 confirmed in my reserved cards (card_id L3_88), 4pts prestige, RED bonus, costs GREEN:7 base. AFFORDABILITY CALCULATION: With my GREEN:3 bonus, effective cost is GREEN:4. I have GREEN:3 tokens + GOLD:1 token = GREEN:4 available. CONFIRMED AFFORDABLE! Payment breakdown: GREEN:3 + GOLD:1 (substitute as GREEN) = GREEN:4 effective checkmark. Strategic impact: (1) Scores 4 prestige points yields 9+4=13 total, maintaining 5-point lead over opponent's 8pts, (2) Gains RED bonus yields total bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, (3) Token state after purchase: BLUE:3 RED:2 BLACK:1 (6 tokens), freeing 4 token slots for future collection, (4) CRITICAL: Places me just 2 points from 15-point victory! Path to victory: L3_86 (5pts, needs BLUE:6 effective, I have BLUE:3) reachable in 3-4 turns collecting BLUE:1 per turn from board supply, OR adapt to Level 2 2-point cards if WHITE tokens become available. Opponent threat check: 8pts, tokens WHITE:4 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1. Can only purchase 0-point Level 1 cards this turn (L1_38/L1_34/L1_2 all affordable but score 0pts). L1_24 reserved needs GREEN:4, has GREEN:1 only, board shows GREEN:0 available so opponent cannot collect GREEN. My 13-8 lead is commanding - opponent needs 7+ points in remaining turns which is extremely difficult. Timeline confirmation: T20 reserved L3_88 gaining GOLD:1, T21 collected tokens reaching GREEN:3+GOLD:1=GREEN:4 effective, T22 PURCHASE L3_88 yields 13pts as planned! Next phase: T23-26 collect BLUE tokens (board has BLUE:1 available), T26-27 purchase L3_86 yields 18pts WIN. This purchase establishes dominant 13-point position with clear victory path. Execute L3_88 purchase!

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=4, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 23 - CRITICAL VICTORY PATH: L2_57 2-POINT WIN IN 2 TURNS! Current state: 13pts (need 2 more for 15pt victory), tokens BLUE:3 RED:2 BLACK:1 (6 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, commanding 5-point lead over opponent's 8pts. BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: L2_57 (2pts, WHITE bonus, costs RED:5 base) on board is IMMEDIATELY WINNABLE! Affordability calculation: RED:5 base cost minus RED:2 bonus equals RED:3 effective cost. I have RED:2 tokens, board shows RED:1 available, taking RED:1 this turn gives me RED:3 exactly matching requirement! Victory timeline: T23 take RED:1 + BLUE:1 + GREEN:1 (3 different colors per rules, board verified RED:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 all available) yields tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:1 (9 total under 10 cap, no returns). T24 purchase L2_57 using RED:3 tokens yields 13+2=15 VICTORY! This achieves WIN in just 2 turns versus L3_86/L3_84 routes requiring 4+ turns collecting BLUE:6 tokens. Token selection rationale: (1) RED:1 ESSENTIAL for L2_57 affordability next turn, (2) BLUE:1 backup progress toward L3_86 if needed, (3) GREEN:1 from GREEN:3 board supply maintains diversity. Token math verified: current 6 + take 3 = 9 total (no returns needed). Opponent threat: 8pts cannot reach 15 before my T24 victory (L1_24 reserved needs GREEN:4 has GREEN:1 scores only 1pt, L2_49 needs WHITE:5 has WHITE:4 but board shows WHITE:0). L2_57 cannot be stolen by opponent (requires RED:5 base, opponent has RED:1 only, would need RED:4 more tokens impossible in 1 turn). Victory GUARANTEED through L2_57 path! Execute RED:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:1 collection!

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=4, BLU=5, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 23), tokens WHITE:4 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (total 8), bonuses BLUE:5 RED:1 BLACK:1, score:8. Reserved L1_24(G4 WHITE+1pt), L2_49(W5 B3 BLUE+2pt). Board: WHITE:0 BLUE:0 GREEN:2 RED:0 BLACK:2 GOLD:4.

Post turn22 RESERVE L2_49 +GOLD1 as planned. CRITICAL THREAT: Opponent can PURCHASE L2_57 (WHITE 2pt R5 eff R:5-2=3 pay R3 exact have), score:15 WIN on their next turn. Must DENY: RESERVE_CARD L2_57 (visible L2), receive GOLD:1 (avail4) -> tokens WHITE:4 GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:2 (total9 <=10, no return). Post: L2_57 reserved safe from opp buy.

Cannot TAKE_TOKENS valid (no 3 diff: only GREEN/Blk avail; 2GREEN/2Blk <4 avail no). Cannot buy L2_57 eff R4 short R3. No other pt buys (L2_58 W6 short1; L2_66 B0 R1 Blk2 short Blk1; L3s heavy short). Nobles short bonuses (no W bonus yet; Blk1<3). Opp other threats low post-deny (L2_66 short Blk2; no W board/tokens for L1_34/38/2/L2_45/58; L3s short W/G/Blk; reserves B6 need B ramp slow board B0; no nobles short W/B/G combos). Optimal: Deny immediate loss, secure 2pt+BLUE:6 next turn, superior path to 15+/catch opp.

======================================================================================

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Turn 24 CRITICAL CORRECTION - Reserve L2_53 for Immediate 14-Point Path. Current state: 13pts (need 2 more for victory), tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:1 (9 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, leading opponent 13-8. FATAL ERROR IN PREVIOUS REASONING: Turn 23 incorrectly claimed L2_57 was on the board - it is actually in opponent's reserved cards! This invalidates entire Turn 24 purchase plan. BOARD CONSTRAINT: Available tokens GREEN:2 BLACK:2 only (WHITE:0 BLUE:0 RED:0 depleted). Cannot take tokens (only 2 colors available, cannot form valid 3-different-colors action; both <4 so cannot take 2-same-color). Cannot purchase board cards: L2_53 costs BLACK:2 effective (have BLACK:1, short 1), L2_66 costs BLACK:3 effective (have BLACK:1, short 2), all others require WHITE:0 or unaffordable. Reserved L3_86/L3_84 need BLUE:6 effective (have BLUE:4, board BLUE:0 unavailable). ONLY VIABLE ACTION: Reserve card for GOLD:1. OPPONENT THREAT ANALYSIS: Opponent 8pts can afford BOTH L2_53 (effective GREEN:3 RED:1 BLACK:1, pays GREEN:1+GOLD:2+RED:1+BLACK:1) AND L2_66 (effective BLUE:0 RED:1 BLACK:2, pays RED:1+BLACK:1+GOLD:1). Both score 1pt→9pts. Cannot block both. OPTIMAL CHOICE: Reserve L2_53 because gaining GOLD:1 makes it IMMEDIATELY PURCHASABLE next turn! After reserve, tokens become BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (10 total). L2_53 effective cost BLACK:2 = BLACK:1+GOLD:1 AFFORDABLE! VICTORY TIMELINE: T24 reserve L2_53+gain GOLD:1. T25 purchase L2_53 using BLACK:1+GOLD:1(as BLACK)→14pts. T26-27 collect tokens for 1pt card→15pts WIN. This is fastest path to 14pts, bypassing blocked BLUE shortage and establishing clear victory route!

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {BLU=5, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 25 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 14-POINT PATH - Purchase L2_53! Current state: 13pts (need 2 for victory), tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (10 total), bonuses BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, narrow 2-point lead over opponent's 11pts (jumped from 8!). CRITICAL DISCOVERY: L2_53 in my reserved cards is IMMEDIATELY PURCHASABLE! Cost calculation: L2_53 base cost GREEN:3 RED:2 BLACK:2, minus my bonuses GREEN:3 RED:2 equals effective cost BLACK:2. I have BLACK:1 token + GOLD:1 token = BLACK:2 available EXACTLY! Payment verified: BLACK:1 + GOLD:1(as BLACK) = BLACK:2 checkmark. IMMEDIATE VICTORY PATH: T25 purchase L2_53 using BLACK:1+GOLD:1 yields 13+1=14pts, gain WHITE:1 bonus, tokens become BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 (8 total). T26 take WHITE:2 (board shows WHITE:4 available, 2-same-color legal) yields WHITE:2 BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 (10 total). T27 purchase L2_41 (1pt, costs WHITE:3 BLUE:2 GREEN:2 base minus bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 equals WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:0 effective, pay WHITE:2+BLUE:1) yields 14+1=15 VICTORY! This achieves win in 3 turns total. OPPONENT THREAT CHECK: 11pts, tokens GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 only (3 total). Cannot afford any scoring cards this turn: L2_45 needs WHITE:4 effective (has 0), L2_66 needs BLACK:2 effective (has 1), reserved L2_49/L2_57 need WHITE:5/RED:4 effective (opponent has 0/1). Opponent needs minimum 3-4 turns to collect tokens for 4+ points, my T27 victory comes first! Alternative rejected: taking tokens wastes turn (already 10/10 cap, would return same amount taken), reserving card gains GOLD but doesn't advance victory timeline. L2_53 purchase establishes commanding 14-point position with guaranteed 2-turn path to 15pts! Execute L2_53 purchase!

Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 25), tokens GREEN:1 RED:1 BLACK:1 (total 3), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:5 RED:1 BLACK:1, score:11. Reserved L1_24(G4 WHITE+1pt), L2_49(W5 B3 BLUE+2pt), L2_57(R5 WHITE+2pt). Board: WHITE:4 BLUE:0 GREEN:2 RED:0 BLACK:3 GOLD:5. Opponent: score:14 (+1 likely L2_53 WHITE1), tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 (total 8), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, reserved L3_86(B7 G3 +5pt eff B6 G0), L3_84(B7 +4pt eff B6). Post turn24 PURCHASE L2_58 (WHITE:6 eff W5 pay W4+GOLD2? adjusted to WHITE1 score+3=11), tokens low total3 ideal ramp. Gap 3pt (11-14), opp needs1pt but NO immediate pt threats: Cannot buy pt cards (L2_45/66/46/41/L3s all short W0/Blk0 despite bonuses; L1s 0pt; reserves B6 pay short B2 from B4 tokens board B0 hampers; no nobles short Blk0/W1/B1/G3 combos). Likely opp buys L1_2 0pt BLACK1 (pay B1 G1 R1 exact) or ramps. Our no pt buys viable now (L1_24 short G3; L2_49 W4 short W1? Wait W0+1=1 short3; L2_57 R4 short3; L2_45 W4 short; L2_66 R1 Blk2 short1; L1_2 0pt pay G1 exact BLACK dup waste; no L3/noble). Optimal: TAKE_TOKENS WHITE:1 GREEN:1 BLACK:1 (3diff avail4/2/3). Post: WHITE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 (total6 no return); board WHITE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:2. Vs 2WHITE (avail4+) -> WHITE:2 total5 inferior (less total tokens6>5, G1<2 slower L1_24, Blk1<2 slower L3s/N10). Enables chain: next ramp e.g. WHITE1 GREEN1 BLACK1 (if avail post-opp) or 2BLACK(if4+) -> total9, buy L1_24 G4 exact +1pt WHITE2 score12 (unlocks N10 Blk2 W2 R2; L3_81 W2 R2 Blk5; L3_82 W2 Blk6; L3_83 W4 B0 R2 Blk2); then L2_49 W4 B0 +2pt BLUE6 (14); ramp R/Blk buy L2_57 R4 +2pt(16) or L3_81 4pt(18) or N10 3pt(17) to 15+ overtake before opp B6 ramps slow (board B0 persistent deny B takes; G1 low). Vs reserve (e.g. L2_45/L3_81) delays pts/GOLD minor vs specific ramp. Vs buy 0pt waste. Superior precise ramp closes gap fast/preempts.

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=5, GRN=4, RED=5}
Reasoning: Turn 26 - CRITICAL ENDGAME: Reserve L3_82 for GOLD→WHITE substitution strategy! Current state: 14pts (need 1 for victory), tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 (8 total), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2. VICTORY CARD IDENTIFIED: L2_41 (1pt, costs WHITE:3 BLUE:2 GREEN:2 base, confirmed on board). With my bonuses, effective cost WHITE:2 BLUE:1 GREEN:0. I have BLUE:4✓ but WHITE:0✗ - cannot afford this turn! OPTIMAL 2-TURN PATH: T26 reserve L3_82→gain GOLD:1 (board shows GOLD:5 available). T27 take WHITE:1+GREEN:1+BLACK:1 (3 different colors, board verified WHITE:3 GREEN:1 BLACK:2 available)→tokens WHITE:1 BLUE:4 GREEN:2 RED:3 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (12 total, return RED:2)→WHITE:1 BLUE:4 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:1 GOLD:1 (10 total). T28 purchase L2_41 using WHITE:1+GOLD:1(as WHITE)+BLUE:1→14+1=15 VICTORY! CARD CHOICE: L3_82 (5pts, WHITE bonus) highest-value board card, denies opponent valuable option. OPPONENT THREAT: 11pts, likely purchases L2_66 (1pt, costs BLUE:3 RED:2 BLACK:3→effective BLUE:0 RED:1 BLACK:2 with bonuses, opponent has RED:1 BLACK:2 exactly)→12pts. L2_41 requires WHITE:2 effective for opponent (has WHITE:1), needs 2 turns to collect+purchase, but my T28 turn comes FIRST—victory secured! Alternative rejected: taking tokens this turn reaches WHITE:1 but still needs T27 reserve for GOLD→WHITE:2 effective, then T28 purchase—same timeline but wastes T26 GOLD opportunity. Reserving NOW optimizes token math and guarantees fastest path. Execute L3_82 reserve!

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=5, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: Current state: My turn (player 1, turn 26), tokens WHITE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 GOLD:0 (total 6), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:5 RED:1 BLACK:1, score:11. Reserved L1_24(G4 WHITE+1pt), L2_49(W5 B3 BLUE+2pt), L2_57(R5 WHITE+2pt). Board: WHITE:3 BLUE:0 GREEN:1 RED:0 BLACK:2 GOLD:4. Opponent: score:14, tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:0 GOLD:1 (total9), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, reserved L3_86/84/82 (B6/G0/W+Blk heavy slow ramps). Post turn25 ramp as planned (WHITE:1 GREEN:2 RED:1 BLACK:2 total6). Gap 3pt (11-14), opp NO immediate pt threats (cannot L2_66 eff B2 Blk3 short Blk3 despite GOLD1 sub1 still short2; L2_45/46/41/L3s short W/Blk/G; L1s 0pt only L1_2 B1 exact +Blk1; reserves B6 short B3+GOLD1=4<6; no nobles short Blk0/W1/B1/G3/R2 for req3s). Our buys: L2_66 exact R1 Blk2 eff B0 R1 Blk2 +1pt RED2 (score12); L2_41 short W1; L1_24 short G2; L1_18 G2 exact +WHITE2 0pt; no L3/noble. Vs BUY L2_66 +1pt now (left W1 G2 total3 score12 RED2): opp then can TAKE W1 G1 Blk1 but total9+3=12>10 return3 net0 waste OR buy L1_2 +Blk1. Ramp next W1 G1 Blk1 (board post-opp) to W2 G3 Blk1 total6, buy L2_41 W2 G2 +1 BLACK2 (13) etc. Vs RAMP NOW WHITE1 GREEN1 BLACK1 (avail3/1/2) → WHITE:2 GREEN:3 RED:1 BLACK:3 (total9 no return), board WHITE:2 GREEN:0 BLACK:1. CRITICAL: Opp CANNOT TAKE_TOKENS (avail W2 Blk1 no 3diff/2same<4+), forced to buy L1_2 +Blk1 0pt (pay B1 left total8) OR reserve +GOLD (total10). Board stays low G0 Blk1 deny further opp ramps. Our next turn27 (total9 high): buy L2_66 R1 Blk2 +1 RED2 (left W2 G3 Blk1 total6 score12) OR L2_41 W2 G2 +1 BLACK2 (left G1 R1 Blk3 total5 score12) OR L1_18 G2 Blk1 +WHITE2 (unlock L3_81 W3→1 etc.) OR reserve L3_81/83. Opp turn28 again CANNOT take (board W2/0/1 low post-our buy), forced inefficient. Superior denial starves opp B ramps (board B0 persistent, now G0/Blk low), secures +1pt next from high tokens, chain to L2_49 W4 B0 +2 (14) / L2_57 R3-4 B0 +2 (16) / L3_81 W2→1/2 R2 Blk5 +4 (18) / N10 Blk2-3 W2-3 R2-3 +3 (17+) with RED2/BLK2 ramp, overtake 15+ before opp B6/G ramps. L1_24 G4 short1 post (G3) pivot ok minor 1pt. Vs buy now risks opp minor ramp/reserve while we delay denial. Optimal: Ramp deny opp takes twice, force 0pt/reserve wastes, position high-token buy next/preempt.

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=5, GRN=4, RED=5, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 27 CRITICAL BOTTLENECK - Purchase L1_2 for BLACK bonus strategy. Current state: 14pts (need 1 for victory!), tokens BLUE:4 GREEN:1 RED:3 GOLD:1 (9 total), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2. BOARD CONSTRAINT: Available tokens only WHITE:2 BLACK:1 (GREEN:0 BLUE:0 RED:0 depleted). TOKEN-TAKING BLOCKED: Cannot take 3 different colors (only 2 available), cannot take 2 same color (WHITE:2<4 BLACK:1<4 both illegal). RESERVE BLOCKED: Already at maximum 3 reserved cards (L3_86 L3_84 L3_82). SCORING CARDS ANALYSIS: L2_41 needs WHITE:2 effective (have WHITE:0+GOLD:1=WHITE:1 short by 1) BUT opponent can afford it (needs WHITE:2 GREEN:2, has WHITE:2 GREEN:3) so will be stolen Turn 27! L2_66 needs BLUE:2 BLACK:3 effective (have BLUE:4✓ BLACK:0+GOLD:1=BLACK:1 short by BLACK:2). L3_86/L3_84 need BLUE:6 effective (have BLUE:4+GOLD:1=BLUE:5 short by BLUE:1). L2_45 needs WHITE:4 (short by 3). No scoring cards affordable! ONLY VIABLE OPTION: Purchase 0-point card to gain bonus and free token space. CARD CHOICE: L1_2 (0pts BLACK bonus costs WHITE:1 BLUE:2 GREEN:1 RED:1 base). With bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2, effective cost WHITE:0 BLUE:1 GREEN:0 RED:0. I have BLUE:4 can pay BLUE:1 exactly! After purchase: tokens BLUE:3 GREEN:1 RED:3 (7 total), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2 BLACK:1. BLACK:1 bonus reduces L2_66 cost to BLACK:2 effective (vs BLACK:3 now). RECOVERY PATH: T27 purchase L1_2 gain BLACK bonus, T28 opponent purchases card returns tokens to board enabling 3-color collection, T29 take tokens including BLACK:1 or WHITE:1 from replenished board, T30-31 collect to afford L2_66 (BLUE:2+BLACK:2 after bonus) yields 14+1=15 VICTORY! Alternative L1_18 (WHITE bonus) rejected because L2_41 will be stolen by opponent anyway and GOLD:1 would be spent on L1_18 purchase leaving no GOLD for future substitution. L1_38 (RED bonus) rejected because RED:3 doesn't help any victory path. Execute L1_2 purchase!

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 14, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: Turn 28 IMMEDIATE VICTORY - Purchase L2_54 for 15-Point Win! Current state: 14pts (need 1 for victory!), tokens WHITE:0 BLUE:3 GREEN:1 RED:3 BLACK:0 GOLD:1 (8 total), bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 GREEN:3 RED:2 BLACK:1, narrow lead over opponent's 12pts. VICTORY DISCOVERED: L2_54 (1pt WHITE bonus, costs WHITE:2 BLUE:3 RED:3 base) on board is IMMEDIATELY PURCHASABLE! Affordability verification: Base cost WHITE:2 BLUE:3 RED:3 minus my bonuses WHITE:1 BLUE:1 RED:2 equals effective cost WHITE:1 BLUE:2 RED:1. Token payment calculation: WHITE:1 covered by GOLD:1(as WHITE)✓, BLUE:2 from BLUE:3✓, RED:1 from RED:3✓. Total payment GOLD:1+BLUE:2+RED:1 EXACTLY MATCHES REQUIREMENT! Purchase yields 14+1=15 VICTORY! Previous turn's L1_2 purchase was strategic setup that freed token slots and gained BLACK:1 bonus. OPPONENT CANNOT WIN BEFORE ME: Opponent 12pts, can potentially purchase L2_41 (1pt, needs WHITE:2 GREEN:2 effective, has WHITE:2 GREEN:3) this turn reaching 13pts, but 13<15 my victory comes first. All higher-scoring cards (L2_45 needs WHITE:4 has WHITE:2, L2_49 needs WHITE:4 has WHITE:2, L2_57 needs RED:3 has RED:0) unaffordable for opponent. IMMEDIATE WIN SECURED! Execute L2_54 purchase!
