Turn 1 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: It's turn 1, and I have no tokens or cards. I need to collect tokens efficiently to start building an engine. The board has 4 of each token color, so taking 3 different colors is possible. Looking at the face-up cards, the cheapest to buy are L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK) and L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE). Those are single-color cards, making them easier targets for early purchase. I should aim for one of them. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK would give me tokens towards both, but note that L1_15 requires 3 BLACK, and L1_23 requires 3 BLUE. Alternatively, I could take BLUE, GREEN, and RED to have more flexibility. However, the nobles require sets of three or four colors, so I might want to start collecting colors that align with nobles. Nobles available: N6 needs WHITE, BLACK, BLUE; N5 needs RED, BLACK; N8 needs WHITE, GREEN, BLUE. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK would directly support N6 and also help towards L1_15 and L1_23. That seems like a solid start. Since I have 0 tokens, taking 3 tokens won't exceed 10, so no need to return. I'll take WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 1 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {}
Reasoning: I'm starting fresh with 0 tokens and need to build an engine. The most efficient opening is taking 3 BLUE tokens (cost 2 each, available 3). This directly contributes to purchasing L1_15, which costs only 3 BLACK tokens but gives a BLUE bonus. Once I have the BLUE bonus, I can use it to purchase other cards. Taking 3 tokens is standard first-turn opening that avoids over-committing to any single color. After this, I'll have 3 BLUE tokens toward my goal.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=3}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: ERROR CORRECTION: I made an invalid move by taking 2 tokens of RED without checking if that was valid. Let me correct my strategy.

CORRECT STRATEGY: I have 0 tokens and 0 bonuses. I need to build a resource base. Looking at the board:

LEVEL 1 options:
- L1_28 (GREEN bonus) costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1 - needs GREEN
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus) costs BLACK:3 - cannot afford
- L1_23 (WHITE bonus) costs BLUE:3 - cannot afford
- L1_38 (RED bonus) costs WHITE:2, RED:2 - cannot afford

L1_28 looks promising as my first purchase target. It costs 5 tokens total but gives a GREEN discount.

Valid token action: Take 3 DIFFERENT colored tokens. I need to take WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN to work toward L1_28.

Current board has plenty of tokens available (WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:4).

This gives me: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 in my bank. Next turn I can take more or reserve/purchase.

Turn 2 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I have 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and 1 BLACK token from turn 1. To progress towards purchasing a card and building bonuses for nobles, I should accumulate more tokens efficiently. The cheapest face-up cards are L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK, gives BLUE bonus) and L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE, gives WHITE bonus), which align with noble N6 (requires 3 WHITE, 3 BLACK, 3 BLUE bonuses). Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK tokens again gives me 2 of each, moving closer to buying either card in the next turn or two. Board tokens are sufficient (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:3), and I have only 3 tokens total, so taking 3 more will not exceed 10, requiring no returns. This maintains focus on my strategy and avoids wasting actions on reserving or returning tokens.

Turn 2 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=1, GRN=1}
Reasoning: I have 0 tokens currently (after opponent's turn). My previous reasoning was to take WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN tokens to work toward purchasing L1_28 (costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1). Taking 3 different colored tokens is valid and follows the rules.

Current board tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:3 - all have at least 1 available, so this action is valid.

After this action: I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1 (3 tokens total, well under the 10 limit).

My strategy is to build a resource base by accumulating these tokens over several turns, then purchase L1_28 for the GREEN bonus which will help me afford higher-level cards.

Turn 3 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: Now I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 BLACK tokens, total 6. I can afford to purchase L1_15 (cost: 3 BLACK) because I have 2 BLACK tokens, and I can use my other tokens to pay the remaining cost? Wait, the card only costs 3 BLACK, so I need exactly 3 BLACK tokens. I have only 2. I can use gold tokens? I don't have any gold tokens. Actually, I can use any other tokens to pay for the cost, but they count as generic tokens, but gold tokens are the only ones that can substitute any color. So without gold, I must have at least 3 BLACK tokens. I only have 2, so I cannot purchase L1_15 yet. Alternatively, L1_23 costs 3 BLUE, I have 2 BLUE, also not enough. So I need more tokens. I could take more tokens, but note that the board has WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:2. So WHITE and BLUE are depleted. I cannot take WHITE or BLUE because there are 0 on the board. I can take GREEN, RED, BLACK. That's 3 different colors. But wait, the board shows BLACK count is 2, so I can take BLACK? Yes, 2 available. However, taking tokens would put me at 6 + 3 = 9 tokens, still under 10, no return needed. But if I take GREEN, RED, BLACK, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:3, GREEN:1, RED:1. That would give me 3 BLACK tokens, enabling purchase of L1_15 next turn. However, note that after taking tokens, my opponent might also take tokens or reserve cards. Alternatively, I could reserve a card. But I think I should focus on acquiring L1_15 as soon as possible because it gives a BLUE bonus and helps towards noble N6. Taking tokens is the way. But I must check if I can take tokens: I need to take 3 different colors, and each must have at least 1 token on board. GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:2 all have at least 1. So yes, I can take GREEN, RED, BLACK. That is valid. I should do that. However, I also consider that maybe I should take 2 of the same color if possible? Only if there are 4+ of that color on board. RED has 4, so I could take 2 RED tokens. That would give me WHITE:2, BLUE:2, BLACK:2, RED:2, total 8. Then next turn I might be able to buy L1_15? Still need 1 more BLACK. But that's not efficient because I'd need to take BLACK later anyway. Taking 2 RED might help towards noble N5 (needs RED, BLACK) but that's a longer term goal. Better to focus on the immediate purchase. So I'll take GREEN, RED, BLACK. That gives me 3 BLACK for L1_15 next turn, and also some diversification. Another thought: I could reserve L1_15 to secure it and get a gold token? The board has 5 gold tokens available. That might be a good move because it prevents opponent from taking it, and I get a gold token which can substitute any color. But then I'd have to pay for it later, but I'd have a gold token to help. However, reserving costs me a turn, and I don't have any reserved cards yet. It might be okay. But I think buying sooner is better. I'll proceed with taking tokens. But wait, after taking tokens, my total tokens will be 9, which is fine. So action_type: TAKE_TOKENS, take_GREEN=1, take_RED=1, take_BLACK=1. However, I need to double-check: the board shows BLACK count 2, but if I take 1 BLACK, there will be 1 left. That's allowed. So that's fine. I'll do that.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_15]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_15
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 BLACK tokens. Board token counts: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 2, RED 4, BLACK 2, GOLD 5. I cannot take WHITE or BLUE because they are 0. I need to take tokens to eventually purchase a card. I can take 3 different colors from those available: GREEN (2), RED (4), BLACK (2). That's allowed because each has at least 1 token. Taking GREEN, RED, BLACK gives me 1 each. After taking, I'll have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. Total tokens: 2+2+3+1+1=9, which is ≤10, so no returns needed. This diversifies my tokens and allows me to aim for cards like L1_38 (costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED) or L1_28 (costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN). However, I still need more BLUE for L1_23 or more BLACK for L1_15. But since WHITE and BLUE are exhausted, I might need to reserve or wait. Alternatively, I could take 2 BLACK tokens (since BLACK has 2 on board, and 4+ required? Actually, rule: take exactly 2 tokens of same color only if 4+ available on board. BLACK has 2, so cannot take 2 BLACK. So must take 3 different colors. The only three colors with tokens are GREEN, RED, BLACK. So I'll take those.

Turn 3 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2}
Reasoning: **Current Status:** I have 6 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:3). No bonuses yet. Score: 0.

**Board Token State:** WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1 available. Many colors have limited supply.

**Purchase Analysis:** I can immediately purchase L1_38 (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, RED:2). I have exactly WHITE:2 and RED:1... wait, I only have RED:1 but need RED:2. Actually, let me recheck my tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:3.

**Wait - I have 6 tokens total but need 4 tokens to buy L1_38.** That's WHITE:2 + RED:2 = 4 tokens. I have enough!

L1_38 is a perfect purchase:
- I have WHITE:2 ✓
- I have RED:1, need RED:2 total - with bonuses I'm at 0, so I need to pay full cost ✓
- Gives RED bonus to help afford higher cards
- Immediate purchase, no return tokens needed

This is much better than token-taking since many colors have 0 on board (WHITE, BLUE), and I can convert tokens into a purchased card. L1_28 would require more BLUE tokens I don't have. L1_15 and L1_23 are not affordable.

**Decision: PURCHASE L1_38** - Gets me my first bonus (RED), converts 4 tokens into a permanent resource, and positions me for future purchases.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_38]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_38
Reasoning: I have tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2 (6 tokens). L1_28 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1 = 5 tokens. I can afford this now! After purchasing, I'll have WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:1 remaining and will gain a GREEN bonus, reducing future GREEN costs. This is a critical early purchase to start building my engine. Since I'm at 6 tokens (well under 10), no returns are needed. I won't take tokens as I'm purchasing directly.

Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_28
Reasoning: Looking at the game state, I (Player 1) currently have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2 (6 tokens total) with no bonuses. My tokens match exactly the cost of L1_28 which is WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1. This gives me a GREEN bonus, which is valuable for purchasing higher-level cards like L2_63 (costs GREEN:5, gives 2 prestige points and GREEN bonus).

The board tokens show WHITE:0, BLUE:0, so I cannot take any tokens of those colors anyway. With this purchase, I'll spend all 6 tokens and gain a GREEN bonus, setting up my engine for future turns. This is the most efficient use of my current resources - I can't take tokens (WHITE and BLUE are empty) and I have exactly enough to purchase L1_28.

Taking this action scores 0 prestige points but provides a GREEN discount that will help me reach 15 prestige points faster in subsequent turns.

Turn 4 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED tokens. Total tokens: 9. Board tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 1. I can take 3 different colors from those with at least 1 token: GREEN (1), RED (3), BLACK (1). Taking these will give me 1 each, bringing my totals to 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 4 BLACK, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, total 12, which exceeds 10 by 2. I must return 2 tokens. Since I want to keep tokens that help me purchase cards, I should return colors I have surplus of or that are less critical. I'm aiming for L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK) and L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE). I have 3 BLACK currently; taking another will give 4, so returning 1 BLACK would bring me to 3, which is enough for L1_15. I also need to return a second token; perhaps GREEN or RED since they're not needed for immediate purchases. Returning 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN would leave me with 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, which is fine. Alternatively, returning 2 GREEN (since I have 1, but taking 1 makes 2, so returning both would leave 0) might be better if I don't need GREEN soon. L1_28 costs 1 GREEN, but that's a later target. I think returning 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN is acceptable. However, I must ensure I don't return tokens that would prevent taking 3 different colors. Actually, I can still take GREEN, RED, BLACK as planned; the return happens after taking, so it's fine. Another option: I could take only 2 tokens of the same color if there are 4+ available. RED has 3, not enough. BLACK has 1, not enough. So must take 3 different. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token and avoid returning, but I have no reserved cards and could use a gold. However, reserving might be suboptimal because I'm close to buying L1_15 (3 BLACK). I have 3 BLACK now; taking another BLACK would give 4, but I need to return one anyway, so effectively I'd still have 3. Actually, I could take GREEN, RED, BLACK and return 2 tokens, maybe 1 BLACK and 1 something else. That will give me 3 BLACK after returns, which is exactly enough to buy L1_15 next turn, assuming board state doesn't change. That seems like a good plan. So I'll take GREEN, RED, BLACK and return 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN.

Turn 4 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2}
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2) which is exactly enough to purchase L1_28, which costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1. This is an excellent move because:

1. I have exactly the right amount of tokens - no waste
2. L1_28 gives a GREEN bonus, which is valuable for purchasing higher-level cards
3. My previous reasoning was to work toward this exact card
4. Purchasing now prevents opponent from possibly buying it
5. This gives me my first bonus, advancing my engine-building strategy

Board token availability note: WHITE and BLUE are depleted (0 available), so I couldn't take tokens anyway. Taking tokens isn't viable this turn due to token scarcity.

After this purchase, I'll have: GREEN:1 bonus, and my tokens will be reduced to WHITE:1, RED:0, BLACK:0 (5 tokens spent).
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_28]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_28
Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2). Looking at the board, most tokens are low: WHITE and BLUE are depleted (0 each), only GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 remain. This limits my options significantly.

Analyzing my position: With 6 tokens and no bonuses, I'm in the mid-game transition phase. I need to either purchase my first card or get closer to doing so.

The L1_15 (BLUE bonus) looks attractive - it's a tier-1 card costing only BLACK:3. If I reserve it, I get a GOLD token (5 available). Combining my 3 existing BLACK tokens with 1 GOLD would let me purchase it immediately next turn.

Alternative: Taking tokens. But with WHITE and BLUE depleted, I can only take from GREEN/RED/BLACK. Taking 2 RED would give me 4 RED total, but L1_38 (RED bonus) costs WHITE:2, RED:2 which I can't afford. Taking 3 different tokens (GREEN, RED, BLACK) would give me 9 total - high but within limit.

Best move: RESERVE L1_15. This gives me a GOLD token which acts as a wildcard, plus positions me to buy the BLUE bonus immediately next turn. This is more strategic than just collecting more tokens with limited colors available.

Action: Reserve L1_15

Turn 5 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED tokens. I need to purchase a card to gain bonuses and prestige. The cheapest cards I can afford are L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE) and L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK). L1_15 is reserved by my opponent, so it's not available for purchase. L1_23 is face-up and I have exactly 3 BLUE tokens (2 BLUE tokens plus my BLUE bonus of 0? Wait, I have no bonuses yet, so I need to pay with tokens only. I have 2 BLUE tokens, but L1_23 costs 3 BLUE. I do not have enough BLUE tokens; I only have 2. My mistake. I cannot afford L1_23. Check other cards: L1_38 costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED. I have 2 WHITE and 2 RED, so I can afford L1_38! L1_38 gives RED bonus and 0 prestige. L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, so I'm short 1 BLUE. L1_1 costs 1 of each color (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED). I have at least 1 of each except I have 0? Actually, I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 2 RED, 3 BLACK, so I have at least 1 of each required. I can afford L1_1! L1_1 gives BLACK bonus and 0 prestige. Which is better? L1_38 gives RED bonus, L1_1 gives BLACK bonus. I'm aiming for noble N6 which requires WHITE, BLACK, BLUE bonuses. So BLACK bonus is useful. Also, I have many BLACK tokens (3), and after purchasing L1_1, I'll have a BLACK bonus, which will help future purchases. L1_38 gives RED, which is less aligned. Also, L1_1 costs only 1 of each, so I'll spend 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. I have enough of each. That will leave me with tokens: 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 3 BLACK. Total tokens: 6, well under 10. Purchasing is better than taking tokens because I avoid returning tokens and gain a bonus. I should purchase L1_1. Wait, check board token counts: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 1, GOLD 4. I could take tokens, but I'm at 9 tokens currently? Actually, from previous reasoning, I had 9 tokens before taking? Let's recount: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED = 2+2+3+1+1 = 9 tokens. I am at 9 tokens. If I take 3 tokens, I'd exceed 10 and need to return. Purchasing reduces my token count, which is good. So purchasing is optimal. I can afford L1_1. Verify cost: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1. I have those. So I'll purchase L1_1.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_23]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_23
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED tokens. Total tokens: 8. L1_23 costs 3 BLUE. I have 2 BLUE tokens, so I need 1 more BLUE. I have 0 bonuses, so I cannot reduce the cost with bonuses. However, I can use gold tokens as wildcards, but I have 0 gold tokens. Therefore, I cannot afford L1_23 because I am short 1 BLUE. Wait, the error said I attempted to purchase L1_23 but had insufficient tokens. Indeed, I have only 2 BLUE tokens, and the cost is 3 BLUE. I need to reconsider. Looking at other affordable cards: L1_38 costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED. I have 2 WHITE and 2 RED? I have 2 WHITE, 1 RED (no, I have 2 RED according to current state? Wait, in the current state, my tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3. So RED is 2. So L1_38 requires 2 WHITE, 2 RED, which I have exactly. That's affordable. L1_28 costs 1 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 1 GREEN. I have 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, so I'm short 1 BLUE. L1_1 costs 1 of each color (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, RED). I have at least 1 of each, so I can afford that. Purchasing L1_1 gives a BLACK bonus, which is useful for noble N6 (needs WHITE, BLACK, BLUE) and also for L1_15 (which opponent reserved) if I later get it. But L1_38 gives RED bonus and 0 prestige, L1_1 gives BLACK bonus and 0 prestige. Both are similar. However, L1_38 costs more tokens (2 WHITE, 2 RED) and I have exactly those, while L1_1 costs 1 each, and I have enough. Purchasing L1_1 would consume 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, leaving me with WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:3. That's 6 tokens total, giving me room to take more tokens next turn. L1_38 would consume 2 WHITE, 2 RED, leaving WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:3. That's also 6 tokens. Which is better? I'm aiming for noble N6 (WHITE, BLACK, BLUE). L1_1 gives a BLACK bonus, which is directly helpful. L1_38 gives RED bonus, which is not directly helpful for N6. However, noble N5 requires RED and BLACK, so RED bonus could help there. But N6 is more aligned with my current colors (WHITE, BLUE, BLACK). I already have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK tokens, and if I buy L1_1, I'll get a BLACK bonus, moving me towards N6. Also, purchasing a card reduces my token count, allowing me to take more tokens efficiently next turn without returning. I think L1_1 is a good purchase because it's cheap and gives a bonus I need. Also, it's a level 1 card, so it's a good early engine piece. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but I have no reserved cards yet, and reserving could give me a gold token. However, I'm close to buying something, so I prefer to purchase now. Let's verify I can afford L1_1: cost is WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. I have at least 1 of each, so yes. I'll purchase L1_1.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_23]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_23
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 2 RED tokens. Total tokens: 2+2+3+1+2 = 10. I was aiming to buy L1_15, but opponent reserved it. L1_23 costs 3 BLUE, and I have 2 BLUE tokens. I cannot afford it because I need 1 more BLUE. However, the error message says 'Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_23', which matches. I must have misread my tokens. Looking at the game state: my tokens are WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:3. That's 2 BLUE. So I cannot buy L1_23 yet. I need to get more BLUE. But board has 0 BLUE tokens. So I cannot take BLUE. I need to consider other options. I can purchase L1_38 (costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED). I have exactly 2 WHITE and 2 RED, so I can afford it. This gives me a RED bonus and 0 prestige, but it's a purchase that uses tokens and gets me a bonus. It also doesn't require returning tokens since I have exactly 10 tokens, and purchasing will reduce my token count. Purchasing L1_38 is a good move because it uses my WHITE and RED tokens, which are not critical for my noble strategy (noble N6 needs WHITE, BLACK, BLUE). But it gives a RED bonus, which might help with noble N5 (requires RED and BLACK). Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token and reduce my token count. However, reserving might not be as good as purchasing a card because purchasing gives a bonus and reduces tokens. I have no reserved cards, so reserving could be useful to secure a card. But since I have 10 tokens, I should prioritize purchasing to avoid waste. I can afford L1_38 immediately. That seems the best move. After purchasing, I'll have 0 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 3 BLACK tokens, total 6, freeing up space. Then next turn I can take tokens to aim for L1_23 or another card. So I'll purchase L1_38.

Turn 5 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I have BLACK:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, WHITE:2, and GOLD:1. My reserved L1_15 card costs BLACK:3 and gives a BLUE bonus. With 3 BLACK tokens and 1 GOLD token (which acts as a wildcard for any color), I can purchase this card immediately.

This is the optimal move because:
1. It converts my tokens into a permanent bonus (BLUE discount)
2. Reduces my token count from 10 to 7, freeing up space
3. Gets me on the board with my first purchased card
4. Sets me up to start working toward the N6 noble (requires WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3) and other nobles

After purchasing, I'll have BLUE:1 bonus which will help me afford higher-level cards in future turns.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_15]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_15
Reasoning: Looking at my current position: I have WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, GOLD:1 (7 tokens total) and L1_15 reserved (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3). However, I have 0 BLACK tokens, so I can't purchase L1_15 yet.

I see that L1_28 (GREEN bonus) costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1. I have EXACTLY what I need: 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN plus 1 GOLD. The GOLD acts as a wildcard substituting for BLUE.

By purchasing L1_28, I:
1. Gain my first bonus (GREEN)
2. Reduce my token count from 7 to 2
3. Get closer to potential Noble requirements (N8 needs WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
4. Set up my engine-building strategy

This is better than reserving another card because I'm actually purchasing a card and starting my collection. With only 2 tokens remaining, I'll be in a good position to take tokens or reserve on my next turn.

Board tokens show WHITE and BLUE are depleted (0 each), so purchasing now before accumulating more limited tokens is optimal.

Turn 6 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, 3 BLACK tokens total 11? Wait, previous state after turn 4: I had 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 3 BLACK = total 9. Then I took GREEN, RED, BLACK (1 each) and returned 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN, so final should be: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN (1+1-1=1), RED (1+1=2), BLACK (3+1-1=3). Total: 2+2+1+2+3=10. Perfect. Now current game state shows my tokens: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 3. That's correct, total 10. Board tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1, GOLD 5. I cannot take any tokens without exceeding 10, unless I return tokens. However, I have enough tokens to purchase a card! I should purchase L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK) but opponent has reserved it. Actually, looking at opponent's reserved cards: L1_15. So that card is not available on the board. I need to check face-up cards. Available: L1_38 (cost 2 WHITE, 2 RED), L1_23 (cost 3 BLUE), L1_1 (cost 1 each), L1_12 (cost 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 RED). I have bonuses: none yet. I can afford L1_23? Cost: 3 BLUE. I have 2 BLUE tokens. Need 1 more BLUE, but I have no gold. Cannot afford. L1_38: cost 2 WHITE, 2 RED. I have 2 WHITE, 2 RED exactly. I can afford that! That gives RED bonus and 0 points. That's a good purchase because it uses tokens and gives me a bonus, moving towards nobles (N5 requires RED, N8 requires WHITE, GREEN, BLUE). It also reduces my token count from 10 to 8 (since I spend 4 tokens). That's beneficial to avoid being stuck at 10. I should purchase L1_38 now. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold and reduce tokens by 1, but purchasing is better because it progresses my engine. Also, I'm close to affording L1_23 if I get one more BLUE, but that requires taking tokens, which I can't do without returning. Purchasing L1_38 now is efficient. So I'll set action_type to PURCHASE_CARD with card_id L1_38.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED tokens. Total tokens: 9. Board tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1, GOLD 5. I can take 3 different colors from those with at least 1 token. I want to aim to purchase L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK) but note that L1_15 is reserved by opponent. Actually, looking at opponent's reservedCards: L1_15 is reserved by opponent. So I cannot purchase L1_15 because it's not on board. However, I could still aim for L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE) which is on board. Alternatively, I could aim for L1_38 (costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED) or L1_1 (costs 1 each). I need to consider my strategy: I have bonuses: none yet. I want to build towards nobles, especially N6 (3 WHITE, 3 BLACK, 3 BLUE) and N8 (3 WHITE, 3 GREEN, 3 BLUE). I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN. So I need more WHITE and BLUE for both nobles. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK would be good, but board has WHITE 1, BLUE 2, BLACK 1. All have at least 1, so I can take 1 each of WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. That would give me 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 4 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. Total tokens: 3+3+4+1+1=12, exceeding 10 by 2. I must return 2 tokens. Since I would have 4 BLACK, I could return 1 BLACK to have 3, and maybe return 1 GREEN or RED. But note: I want to keep BLACK for possible purchases, but L1_15 is taken, so maybe I don't need as much BLACK. However, there is L2_65 that costs BLACK, and noble N6 requires BLACK bonuses, not tokens. So I still want to collect BLACK tokens to buy cards that give BLACK bonuses. But I have no BLACK bonuses yet. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, GREEN to support N8 and L1_12 (costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 RED) but that's more expensive. Let's check affordable cards now: With my current tokens, I can purchase L1_1 (costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED). I have: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 3. So I have exactly enough for L1_1 (no gold). That's a zero-point card that gives BLACK bonus. That would help towards N6 (needs BLACK bonus). So I could purchase L1_1 this turn. That would be a good move because it uses tokens, gives me a bonus, and avoids returning tokens. After purchasing, I would have tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 3 (since cost subtracts 1 each). Total tokens: 1+1+0+0+3=5, well under 10. Then I can take tokens next turn. However, I must verify that L1_1 is indeed on board. Yes, it's face-up: L1_1. So purchasing L1_1 is possible and efficient. It gives me a BLACK bonus, moving towards N6. Also, it reduces my token count, allowing me to take more tokens next turn without returning. So I should purchase L1_1. That's a better move than taking tokens and returning. Let me confirm: action_type PURCHASE_CARD, card_id L1_1. I have enough tokens: cost is 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. I have at least those amounts. No gold needed. So I'll purchase L1_1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED tokens. Total tokens: 9. Board tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1, GOLD 5. I can take 3 different colors from those with at least 1 token: GREEN (2), RED (2), BLACK (1). Taking these will give me 1 each, bringing my totals to 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 4 BLACK, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, total 12, which exceeds 10 by 2. I must return 2 tokens. I am aiming to purchase L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK) but note that L1_15 is reserved by opponent (it's in their reservedCards). So I cannot purchase it from the board. However, I could aim for L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE) which is still available. But I have only 2 BLUE tokens, and board has 2 BLUE. To get more BLUE, I could take BLUE, but I need to take 3 different colors. Since BLUE is available (2 tokens), I could take BLUE, GREEN, and RED for example. That would give me 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, bringing my totals to 2 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, total 12 again, exceeding by 2. I need to return 2 tokens. Which colors to return? I want to keep BLUE for L1_23, so I should return colors I don't need immediately. I have 3 BLACK, but L1_15 is taken; there is L1_1 which costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, but that's cheap and I could buy it soon. I also have L1_38 (costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED). I have 2 WHITE and 2 RED after taking? Actually, if I take BLUE, GREEN, RED, I'll have 2 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 2 GREEN, 2 RED. That's enough to buy L1_38 (2 WHITE, 2 RED) if I use tokens. But I need to consider returning. If I return 2 tokens, I could return 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN, leaving me with 2 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 2 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 2 RED. That's 10 total. Then next turn I could buy L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE) because I'd have 3 BLUE tokens. Alternatively, I could buy L1_38 now? Wait, I can't buy now because I'm taking tokens this turn. Next turn I could buy. So taking BLUE, GREEN, RED and returning 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN seems good. But I must ensure that taking BLUE, GREEN, RED is valid: board has BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, all >=1. So yes. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK? Board has WHITE 1, BLUE 2, BLACK 1, all >=1. That would give me 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK, totals become 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 4 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED = 12 tokens, exceed by 2. I would need to return 2 tokens. I could return 1 BLACK and 1 something else. That would leave me with 3 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 2 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 1 RED = 10. That gives me 3 BLUE to buy L1_23 next turn. Also 3 WHITE and 2 BLACK progress towards noble N6. This seems even better because it focuses on my strategy. So I'll take WHITE, BLUE, BLACK and return 1 BLACK and 1 GREEN. I need to check that WHITE is available (1 token). Yes. So action: take_WHITE=1, take_BLUE=1, take_BLACK=1, return_BLACK=1, return_GREEN=1.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn={GREEN=1, BLACK=1}]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Taking: 3, Returning: 2. Skipping turn.

Turn 6 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2}
Reasoning: My opponent has 10 tokens and could purchase L1_28 next turn (costs WHITE:1, BLUE:3, GREEN:1). I currently have WHITE:1, GREEN:1, and need 2 more GREEN tokens to afford it. By reserving L1_28 now, I:
1. Prevent my opponent from getting this GREEN bonus card
2. Get a GOLD token which acts as a wildcard for future purchases
3. Maintain strategic flexibility for my next turn

This is better than purchasing a card I can afford now (like L1_1) because the opportunity cost of losing L1_28 is too high - it's a key engine component that enables purchasing higher-level cards.

After reserving, my tokens will be: WHITE:2, GREEN:2, BLUE:1 (5 tokens). I'll need to take more GREEN tokens next turn to complete the purchase.

I reserve L1_28 to block my opponent and secure a GOLD token for my future engine-building strategy.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_28, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card with ID L1_28 not found on board.
Reasoning: I have WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 tokens, with a GREEN bonus from L1_28. I reserved L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3) but have 0 BLACK tokens. I need to acquire more tokens to eventually purchase this card. Looking at available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5. I can take 3 different tokens or 2 of the same color. The best move is to RESERVE L1_15 again to get another GOLD token. This is strategic because: 1) I already have a reserved copy, 2) GOLD acts as a wildcard substituting any color, 3) With 2 GOLD tokens, I can use them as BLACK to purchase L1_15 immediately next turn, 4) This gives me my second bonus (BLUE) which accelerates engine building. Taking tokens would be less efficient since I'd still need BLACK tokens specifically. The reserve action is legal as L1_15 is visible on the board. After this, I'll have a GOLD token and can purchase L1_15 next turn using 3 BLACK tokens converted from 2 GOLD + 1 actual BLACK (or 3 GOLD tokens).
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_15, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Card with ID L1_15 not found on board.
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have WHITE:1, GREEN:1 (2 tokens total) and just purchased L1_28 for the GREEN bonus. My reserved card is L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3), which I cannot afford yet since I have 0 BLACK tokens.

**Board Token Analysis:**
Available: WHITE:1, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5
BLUE tokens are available, which is good for potential future purchases.

**Strategic Options:**
1. **Take tokens** - I could take 3 different colors or 2 of one color
2. **Reserve a card** - This gives me a GOLD token

**Optimal Move: RESERVE L1_23**
L1_23 provides a WHITE bonus (which I don't have) and costs BLUE:3. By reserving it:
- I get 1 GOLD token (5 available)
- I gain a future option for a WHITE bonus
- GOLD can substitute for any color, giving me flexibility

**Why not take tokens?**
- Taking 3 different colors (WHITE, BLUE, GREEN) would give me 5 total
- Taking 2 RED would give me 2 RED, but I need BLACK for L1_15
- Either way, I can't purchase anything meaningful this turn

**Why reserve L1_23 over other options?**
- L1_38 costs WHITE:2, RED:2 - I have WHITE:1, need more
- L1_1 costs 1 of each - too expensive
- L1_12 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1 - I have GREEN:1, need more

**Future Plan:**
After reserving L1_23, I'll work on gathering BLACK tokens to purchase L1_15 (currently reserved). Then I can purchase L1_23 with my accumulated tokens plus GOLD.

**Final Action: RESERVE L1_23**
This gives me a GOLD token and positions me to build a multi-color bonus engine, working toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) and prestige point cards.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_23, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 7 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 3 BLACK, 1 GREEN, 2 RED tokens. Total tokens: 10. I previously aimed for L1_15 (costs 3 BLACK) but it is now reserved by opponent. L1_23 (costs 3 BLUE) is also reserved by opponent. I need to purchase an affordable card to free up tokens and gain bonuses. Checking face-up cards: L1_38 costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED. I have 2 WHITE, 2 RED, so I can purchase it exactly. It gives a RED bonus and 0 points. That's acceptable to start building bonuses. Other options: L1_1 costs 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED. I have enough tokens: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 2. That uses 1 of each, leaving tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 3. That gives a BLACK bonus, which aligns with noble N6. L1_34 costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK. I have enough: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, BLACK 3. That uses those tokens, leaving WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 2, BLACK 2. It gives a RED bonus. Comparing: L1_1 gives BLACK bonus (useful for N6 and L1_15 if I later buy it from reserve? Actually L1_15 is reserved by opponent, so I cannot buy it unless they somehow lose it, which is unlikely. So focusing on N6 might still be good. But L1_1 costs 4 tokens of different colors, which uses more tokens and helps reduce my token count from 10 to 6. That's good because I'm at max tokens. L1_38 uses 4 tokens but only two colors, reducing to 6 as well. L1_34 uses 5 tokens, reducing to 5. I want to free up token capacity to collect more efficiently. Purchasing any card is better than taking tokens and returning. Since I'm at 10 tokens, I must either purchase or reserve. Purchasing is better because it advances my engine. I'll choose L1_1 because it gives a BLACK bonus, and I already have BLACK tokens which might help for future cards like L2_65 (needs BLACK) or N6. Also, L1_1 is cheaper in terms of specific color requirements, and I have exactly the tokens. So I'll purchase L1_1.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card null not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I have 2 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 2 RED, and 3 BLACK tokens. My total tokens is 11? Wait, let's recount: 2+2+2+2+3 = 11. That's already 11 tokens, which exceeds the limit of 10. This is problematic because I must have miscalculated earlier. I need to correct this immediately. The game state shows my tokens: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 3. That's 2+2+1+2+3 = 10. Actually, that's 10 tokens. So I'm at exactly 10 tokens. I cannot take any more tokens without returning, which would be inefficient. I should purchase a card to reduce my token count and gain bonuses. Looking at the face-up cards, I can afford L1_38 (costs 2 WHITE, 2 RED). I have exactly 2 WHITE and 2 RED, so I can buy it with tokens alone, no bonuses or gold needed. This gives me 0 prestige points but a RED bonus, which helps toward noble N5 (needs RED and BLACK) and possibly other cards. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_1 (costs 1 of each color), but I lack 1 BLUE? I have 2 BLUE, so I can afford it: 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK. That would give me a BLACK bonus, but I'd be using 5 tokens, which is fine. However, L1_1 gives 0 prestige and a BLACK bonus, which is useful for noble N6. But L1_38 is cheaper in terms of token variety and gives RED bonus. I think I should buy L1_38 because it uses exactly the tokens I have in the right amounts, and it aligns with my strategy of collecting colors for nobles. After purchasing, my token count will drop to 8 (since I spend 4), leaving me room to take tokens next turn. My bonuses will be: RED 1. This is a solid move. I must avoid returning tokens, so purchasing is best. I cannot afford other cards like L1_12 (costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 RED) because I don't have enough GREEN. L1_34 costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK; I have those, but that's 5 tokens, also okay. But L1_38 is simpler and uses tokens I have exactly. I'll go with L1_38.

======================================================================================

Turn 7 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=2, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have WHITE:1, GREEN:1, GOLD:1 (4 tokens total) with my GREEN bonus from L1_28. I have L1_15 reserved (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3) and L1_23 reserved (WHITE bonus, costs BLUE:3).

**Board Token State:**
Available: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

**Strategic Analysis:**
I need BLACK tokens for L1_15 and BLUE tokens for L1_23. Currently there are only 1 BLACK and 2 BLUE available.

**Option 1: Reserve L1_38** - Costs WHITE:2, RED:2, gives RED bonus. Not my priority.
**Option 2: Reserve L1_20** - Costs WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1, gives WHITE bonus. Could work toward N8.
**Option 3: Take tokens** - Expand my resource base to eventually purchase.

**My decision:** TAKE TOKENS - specifically WHITE, GREEN, and BLUE (3 different colors).

Rationale:
- I have 4 tokens now, after taking 3 more I'll have 7 total (well under 10 limit)
- WHITE tokens are plentiful (3 available)
- BLUE tokens are available (2 available) - I need BLUE for L1_23
- GREEN tokens are available (2 available) - I have GREEN bonus so this is doubly useful

I already have 1 WHITE and 1 GREEN, so taking 1 more of each plus 1 BLUE gives me:
- WHITE:2 (for L1_20 or other WHITE-cost cards)
- BLUE:1 (working toward L1_23's requirement of BLUE:3)
- GREEN:2 (with bonus, this gives me 3 GREEN effectively)

BLACK tokens are limited (only 1 available), so I'll wait to take that when it's strategic.

After this action, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, GOLD:1 (6 tokens). This positions me to potentially reserve a card next turn or take more tokens.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 8 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I need to acquire tokens to purchase L1_1, which provides a BLACK bonus and helps toward noble N6. I currently have the BLUE and GREEN tokens required but lack WHITE. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN tokens will give me exactly what I need to buy L1_1 next turn, while also depleting scarce resources (BLUE and GREEN) that could hinder my opponent. My token count will increase from 6 to 9, well under the limit, so no returns are needed. This move advances my engine efficiently and maintains tempo.

======================================================================================

Turn 8 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: After careful analysis, I need to revise my previous plan. I have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, GOLD:1 (6 tokens). I reserved L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3) and L1_23 (WHITE bonus, costs BLUE:3), but cannot purchase either yet.

Board tokens available: WHITE:1, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

Taking tokens: BLUE and GREEN are depleted (0 each), so I cannot take those. Taking 2 RED would give me 8 tokens total.

Reserving L1_20 (WHITE bonus, costs WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1) is strategic because:
- I gain a GOLD token (wildcard for any color)
- It contributes to N8 requirement (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
- With GOLD as wildcard, I need only 3 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 BLACK to purchase
- I already have 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, and will get GOLD now

Alternative: Take 2 RED tokens (8 total) - but this doesn't give me the flexibility of a GOLD token.

Best move: RESERVE L1_20. This gives me a GOLD wildcard token and works toward the WHITE bonus I need for N8. After this action, I'll have WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:2 (7 tokens total).

======================================================================================

Turn 9 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=1, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 3, GREEN 2, RED 0, BLACK 3. Total tokens: 1+3+2+0+3 = 9. I have 1 RED bonus from purchased L1_38. I can purchase L1_1 (cost: 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK). I have enough tokens: WHITE 1 >=1, BLUE 3 >=1, GREEN 2 >=1, RED bonus 1 covers RED cost, BLACK 3 >=1. Purchasing L1_1 will cost me tokens: I will spend 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, and use my RED bonus for the RED cost. After purchase, my tokens will be: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 0, BLACK 2. Total tokens: 5. That reduces my token count from 9 to 5, freeing up room to take more tokens next turn. L1_1 gives a BLACK bonus, which is valuable for noble N6 (requires WHITE, BLACK, BLUE bonuses) and also for future cards. Additionally, purchasing now prevents potential blocking by opponent if they want L1_1. Other cards: L1_12 costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 RED - I lack GREEN (only 2) and RED bonus might not cover all, but I could use gold? I have no gold. L1_34 costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK - I lack WHITE (only 1) and no bonus. L1_19 costs 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK - I have enough BLUE and GREEN and BLACK, but it gives WHITE bonus, which is also good for noble N6. However, L1_1 gives BLACK bonus, which I currently have 0 bonuses in BLACK, and it helps toward noble N6 (needs BLACK 3) and N5 (needs BLACK 4). Since I already have a RED bonus, adding BLACK expands my bonus portfolio. Also, L1_1 uses all colors, which is efficient in reducing token diversity. I could also consider reserving, but I have 9 tokens, so taking more would require returns. Purchasing is the best to avoid waste. So I'll purchase L1_1.

======================================================================================

Turn 9 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, GLD=2}
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current position carefully:

**Current Position:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, GOLD:2 (7 tokens total)
- Bonuses: GREEN:1
- Reserved: L1_15 (BLUE bonus, needs BLACK:3), L1_23 (WHITE bonus, needs BLUE:3), L1_20 (WHITE bonus, needs WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1)
- Purchased: L1_28 (GREEN bonus)

**Board Tokens:** WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:3

**My Strategic Analysis:**
I have 7 tokens and 3 reserved cards. To reach 15 prestige efficiently, I need to start purchasing my reserved cards. L1_20 costs WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1 and gives a WHITE bonus - this is key for N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3).

**Plan: Take tokens first, then purchase L1_20**

1. **Take 3 different tokens:** WHITE, BLUE, GREEN
   - All three colors are available on the board
   - Current 7 + 3 = 10 tokens (at limit, but this is fine since I'm purchasing immediately)
   - New totals: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, GOLD:2

2. **Purchase L1_20 using GOLD as BLACK wildcard**
   - Cost: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, BLACK:1
   - I have: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, BLACK:0, GOLD:2
   - Use 1 GOLD as BLACK substitute
   - After purchase: WHITE:0, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, GOLD:1 (5 tokens)

**Why this works:**
- With my GREEN bonus, I effectively have GREEN:4 total
- I get a WHITE bonus (contributes to N8 requirement)
- I reduce from 10 to 5 tokens (good position)
- WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:3 (effective), GOLD:1 gives me flexibility for next turns

**Alternative considered:** Purchasing L1_34 (RED bonus) - but this doesn't contribute to N8. My strategy is to focus on WHITE, GREEN, BLUE bonuses for N8 first.

**Final state after this turn:**
- Bonuses: GREEN:1, WHITE:1
- Tokens: 5 (under limit)
- Reserved: L1_15, L1_23 (still working toward these)
- Purchased: L1_28, L1_20 (making progress)
- Closer to N8 (WHITE:3 requirement partially met with bonus)

Turn 10 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=1, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I can purchase L1_19 (cost: 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK). I have BLUE 2 tokens, GREEN 1 token, BLACK 3 tokens, plus a BLACK bonus 1 (from L1_1). The cost requires 2 BLUE: I have exactly 2 BLUE tokens. 2 GREEN: I have 1 GREEN token, so I need 1 more GREEN. I can use my BLACK bonus? No, bonuses are specific to the gem color; I have BLACK bonus, not GREEN. So I cannot afford the GREEN requirement. Wait, I also have a RED bonus 1, which is irrelevant. So I cannot buy L1_19 because I lack 1 GREEN token. Check other cards: L1_12 costs 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 1 RED. I have BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED bonus 1. Need 3 GREEN, only have 1, cannot afford. L1_34 costs 2 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK. I have WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, BLACK 3. I lack WHITE tokens and no WHITE bonus. Cannot afford. L1_5 costs GREEN 2, RED 1. I have GREEN 1, RED bonus 1. Need 2 GREEN, only have 1, cannot afford. So I cannot purchase any face-up card with my current tokens and bonuses. I should take tokens to build towards a purchase. My token count is 6 (0 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 0 RED, 3 BLACK). That's 6 tokens, so I can take up to 3 more without exceeding 10. Board tokens: WHITE 4, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 4, BLACK 1, GOLD 5. I can take 3 different colors from those with at least 1 token. All colors have at least 1 except maybe BLUE has 2, GREEN has 1, RED has 4, BLACK has 1, WHITE has 4. I should take colors that help me buy a card soon. I am interested in noble N6 (needs WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3). I currently have bonuses: RED 1, BLACK 1. I need to build WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK bonuses. Purchasing L1_19 gives WHITE bonus, which is good. To afford L1_19, I need 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK. I have BLUE 2, BLACK 3, but GREEN only 1. So I need 1 more GREEN token. Also, I could use a gold token if I reserve, but I have no gold. So taking GREEN is a priority. Also, I might want to take WHITE to start building WHITE tokens for future purchases. So I could take WHITE, GREEN, and another color like RED or BLACK. Taking WHITE, GREEN, and RED would diversify. After taking, I'd have WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 3 = total 9 tokens. Then next turn I could buy L1_19 (cost 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK) because I'd have exactly 2 GREEN. However, I would need to spend 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK, leaving me with WHITE 1, RED 1. That works. Alternatively, I could take WHITE, GREEN, BLACK to get BLACK for other cards, but BLACK I already have 3. Taking another BLACK would give 4, but that's okay. However, L1_19 requires only 1 BLACK, so extra is fine. But I should consider that taking BLACK might be less needed. I'll take WHITE, GREEN, and RED to spread out.

Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_19]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_19
Reasoning: I have 6 tokens (WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 0, BLACK 3) and bonuses RED 1, BLACK 1. No face-up cards are affordable for purchase now. To advance, I need to acquire tokens to buy a card next turn. L1_5 (BLACK bonus) costs GREEN 2, RED 1, and L1_19 (WHITE bonus) costs BLUE 2, GREEN 2, BLACK 1. Both require one more GREEN token. By taking GREEN, I can afford either card next turn. I must take exactly 3 different colors. Choosing GREEN, WHITE, and BLACK: GREEN for immediate need, WHITE to start building WHITE bonuses for nobles (N6, N8), and BLACK to supplement my existing tokens. Board tokens: GREEN 1, WHITE 4, BLACK 1, all available. After taking, I'll have 9 tokens (≤10), so no returns needed. This sets up a purchase of L1_19 or L1_5 next turn, gaining bonuses and moving toward nobles.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: For taking 2 tokens, they must be of the same color.
Reasoning: I currently have 6 tokens (WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 0, BLACK 3) and bonuses RED 1, BLACK 1. My goal is to build bonuses for nobles, especially N6 which requires WHITE, BLACK, and BLUE. I cannot afford any face-up card immediately, but L1_19 (WHITE bonus, cost 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK) is highly attractive. With my BLACK bonus covering the BLACK cost, I need 2 BLUE tokens (have 2) and 2 GREEN tokens (have 1). By taking 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, and 1 RED, I'll reach 2 GREEN tokens, enabling me to purchase L1_19 next turn. This also gathers WHITE and RED tokens for future purchases. Available tokens on board support this: WHITE 4, GREEN 1, RED 4. Taking three different colors is valid, and my total tokens will be 9, under the limit of 10, so no returns needed. This move efficiently advances my engine toward noble N6 and prevents wasting turns.

======================================================================================

Turn 10 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=3}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 4 tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:2, GOLD:1. My bonuses are WHITE:1, GREEN:1. I have two reserved cards: L1_15 (BLUE bonus, needs BLACK:3) and L1_23 (WHITE bonus, needs BLUE:3).

**Strategic Analysis:**
My opponent has BLACK:3 tokens, so BLACK is limited and critical. With only 1 BLACK token on the board, I need to act quickly. My goal is to purchase L1_15 (BLUE bonus) which requires 3 BLACK tokens.

**Available Nobles:**
- N8 requires WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3 (worth 3 points) - this is achievable with my WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses
- N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4 - not my focus
- N6 requires WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3 - alternative path

**Action Decision: RESERVE L1_34**
L1_34 is visible on the board (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1). By reserving it:
- I gain 1 GOLD token (wildcard for any color)
- I get a RED bonus (adds to my resource engine)
- This is more valuable than taking tokens when specific colors are depleted

**Token Strategy:**
Board tokens available: WHITE:3, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:5
GREEN is depleted (0), so I cannot take GREEN tokens. I'll take 2 RED and 1 BLACK token:
- RED: 2 (I have 0, need to build for future purchases)
- BLACK: 1 (critical for L1_15, scarce resource)

**Final Token Calculation:**
Current: 4 tokens → Take 3 → 7 tokens (under 10 limit)
Result: BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:2 (from reserve)

**Why this approach?**
1. GOLD from reserving gives me wildcard flexibility
2. BLACK token is scarce (only 1 available, opponent has 3)
3. RED tokens are plentiful (3 available) and useful for Level 2+ cards
4. After this, I'll be well-positioned to take more BLACK tokens next turn

**Future Plan:**
With my BLACK bonus cards (L1_15, L1_34) and accumulated resources, I'll work toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) and prestige point cards. My token spread provides flexibility for both L1_15 (needing BLACK) and L1_23 (needing BLUE).

======================================================================================

Turn 11 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 3. Total tokens: 1+2+2+1+3 = 9. Bonuses: RED 1, BLACK 1. I can afford L1_19 (cost: 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 1 BLACK). Using my BLACK bonus of 1, the cost reduces to: 2 BLUE, 2 GREEN, 0 BLACK. I have exactly 2 BLUE tokens and 2 GREEN tokens, so I can purchase it without spending any BLACK tokens. This will cost me 2 BLUE and 2 GREEN tokens. After purchase, my tokens will be: WHITE 1, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 3. Total tokens: 5, well under the limit. L1_19 gives a WHITE bonus, which is crucial for noble N6 (requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3). My bonuses will become: RED 1, BLACK 1, WHITE 1. This significantly progresses me towards N6 and also towards N8 (needs WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3). Purchasing now is efficient because it uses tokens I have exactly, reduces my token count to allow future token acquisition, and advances my engine. Alternatives: I could take tokens to aim for another card, but I'm at 9 tokens, so taking more would bring me to 10 or require returns. Purchasing is better to avoid waste. I could also consider L1_5 (cost 2 GREEN, 1 RED), but it gives BLACK bonus which I already have, and only 0 prestige. L1_9 costs 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK; I have those tokens, but it gives BLUE bonus which is less critical than WHITE for nobles. L1_19 is the best target. My opponent has reserved L1_15, L1_23, L1_34, but L1_19 is available. I should buy it now to prevent them from potentially taking it.

======================================================================================

Turn 11 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=1, GRN=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 5 tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, GOLD:1. My bonuses are WHITE:1, GREEN:1. I have three reserved cards: L1_15 (BLUE bonus, needs BLACK:3), L1_23 (WHITE bonus, needs BLUE:3), and L1_34 (RED bonus, needs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1).

**Board Token State:**
Available: WHITE:3, BLUE:4, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:4

**Strategic Analysis:**
My primary goal is to reach 15 prestige points. Looking at available Nobles:
- N8 requires WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3 (3 points)
- N6 requires WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3 (3 points)
- N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4 (3 points)

I already have WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses, so I need 2 more WHITE and 2 more GREEN bonuses for N8. A BLUE bonus is critical to unlock either N8 or N6.

**Card Analysis:**
L1_9 (BLUE bonus, cost: WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) is ideal because:
- It provides the BLUE bonus I need for N8/N6
- With my WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses, effective cost is: WHITE:0, GREEN:0, RED:1, BLACK:1
- I have RED:1 and GOLD:1, so I can substitute BLACK with GOLD

**Action Plan:**
1. Reserve L1_9 to get a GOLD token
2. Take tokens: WHITE, GREEN, BLUE (3 different colors)
3. Purchase L1_9 using bonuses + GOLD as BLACK substitute

**Token Calculation:**
- Current: 5 tokens → Reserve +1 GOLD = 6 tokens
- Take WHITE, GREEN, BLUE = 3 tokens → 9 tokens total (under 10 limit)
- Purchase L1_9: Spend RED:1, BLACK:0 (GOLD substitute) → 7 tokens after purchase

**Result:** I gain a BLUE bonus (working toward N8/N6), maintain 7 tokens (under limit), and don't waste my GOLD wildcard. My reserved cards (L1_15 needing BLACK:3 and L1_23 needing BLUE:3) remain valid for future turns.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_9, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot reserve more than 3 cards.
Reasoning: I have 3 reserved cards already (L1_15, L1_23, L1_34), so I cannot reserve another visible card. However, I can reserve from a deck which doesn't count toward the 3-card limit for face-up cards. I'll reserve blind from LEVEL_1 to get a GOLD token and potentially draw a BLUE bonus card (which I need for L1_23). After this action, I'll have 5 tokens total with a GOLD wildcard, positioning me to either take tokens next turn or purchase L1_34 (cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1), which I can afford using my GOLD as a wildcard.
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=null, deckLevel=LEVEL_1, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot reserve more than 3 cards.
Reasoning: I realize the previous error - I already have 3 reserved cards (L1_15, L1_23, L1_34) so I cannot reserve another card. My current tokens are: GREEN:2, GOLD:1 (4 total). I have WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses.

Looking at what I can purchase:
- L1_15 costs BLACK:3 - I have 0 BLACK
- L1_23 costs BLUE:3 - I have 0 BLUE
- L1_34 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 - I can't afford this
- Board cards all require colors I don't have

My best action is to take 3 tokens: WHITE, BLUE, and BLACK.

Why WHITE:1, BLUE:1, BLACK:1?
- WHITE: I have 1 bonus, taking 1 gives me actual WHITE tokens to use
- BLUE: I need 3 total to buy L1_23 (WHITE bonus, costs BLUE:3)
- BLACK: Critical scarce resource - opponent has 3, only 1 on board. I need BLACK:3 for L1_15 (BLUE bonus)

After this action: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens - well under 10)

This positions me to continue accumulating toward purchasing my reserved cards.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={WHITE=1, BLUE=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 12 - Player 0's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, RED=2, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens (WHITE1, BLUE0, GREEN0, RED1, BLACK3) and bonuses WHITE1, RED1, BLACK1. After applying bonuses to L2_65's cost (WHITE2, RED2, BLACK3), the effective cost is WHITE1, RED1, BLACK2, which I can afford with my tokens. Purchasing L2_65 gives 1 prestige point (my first) and a RED bonus, increasing my RED bonus to 2. This advances me toward noble N5 (needs RED4, BLACK4) and reduces my token count from 5 to 1, freeing space for future token acquisition. Alternatives like taking tokens to buy lower-value cards (e.g., L1_9 or L1_25) yield 0 prestige, so purchasing L2_65 is more efficient for scoring and engine building.

Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=3, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 6 tokens (WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) with WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses. My reserved cards require:
- L1_15: BLACK:3 (need 2 more BLACK)
- L1_23: BLUE:3 (need 2 more BLUE)
- L1_34: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (need 1 more WHITE, 0 more BLUE, 0 more GREEN, 0 more BLACK)

**Strategic Analysis:**
- N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) is my target - gives 3 prestige points
- I have WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses, need to accumulate tokens
- BLACK is critical but limited (only 2 on board, opponent has 1)
- BLUE needs 2 more to reach 3

**Token Strategy:**
Board has sufficient tokens of all colors I need. Taking 3 different tokens:
- WHITE:1 (toward N8 requirement)
- BLUE:1 (toward L1_23 requirement of BLUE:3)
- GREEN:1 (toward N8 requirement)

After this action: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (9 tokens - under 10 limit)

**Future Planning:**
With WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:1, I can:
- Take 2 BLACK next turn to complete L1_15 (BLACK:3)
- Then focus on BLUE for L1_23
- Also positioning toward N8 with WHITE:2, GREEN:3, BLUE:2

This action efficiently builds toward both my reserved card purchases and N8 noble, while staying safely under the 10-token limit.

Turn 13 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I need to acquire tokens to purchase L1_9, which provides a BLUE bonus and helps toward noble N6. My current bonuses (WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1) cover all costs of L1_9 except for 1 GREEN token. Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN tokens will give me the needed GREEN token to buy L1_9 next turn, while also collecting BLUE and WHITE tokens for future purchases. This move advances my engine efficiently, depletes scarce resources like GREEN on the board, and maintains tempo. My token count will increase from 1 to 4, well under the limit of 10, so no returns are needed.

Turn 13 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=2, GRN=4, BLK=1, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 9 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) with WHITE:1 and GREEN:1 bonuses. My reserved cards have requirements:
- L1_15: BLACK:3 (need 2 more BLACK)
- L1_23: BLUE:3 (I have 2 BLUE + 1 BLUE bonus = 3 total, can afford!)
- L1_34: WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (need more WHITE)

**Strategic Analysis:**
- N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) is my target - gives 3 points
- L1_23 costs BLUE:3 and gives a WHITE bonus - contributes to N8 requirement
- With my BLUE:2 tokens + BLUE:1 bonus = 3 BLUE total, I can afford this purchase
- Purchasing reduces me from 9 to 6 tokens (good position)
- After purchase: WHITE:2, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 (6 tokens)
- Bonuses become WHITE:2, GREEN:1 (even closer to N8)

**Why not other options:**
- L1_15 costs BLACK:3 (I have only 1 BLACK)
- L1_34 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (need more WHITE)
- Taking tokens would exceed limit (9 + 3 = 12, would need to return 3)

**Final action: PURCHASE L1_23**
This gives me a WHITE bonus, gets me closer to N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3), and reduces my token count efficiently.

======================================================================================

Turn 14 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 0, BLACK 1. Total tokens: 4. Bonuses: WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I can purchase L1_9 (cost: 1 WHITE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, 1 BLACK). Applying my bonuses: WHITE cost 1 reduced by WHITE bonus 1 => 0; RED cost 1 reduced by RED bonus 2 => 0; BLACK cost 1 reduced by BLACK bonus 1 => 0; GREEN cost 1 remains. So I need to pay 1 GREEN token. I have exactly 1 GREEN token. After purchase, tokens become: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 1. Total tokens: 3, which is fine. L1_9 gives a BLUE bonus, which is crucial for noble N6 (requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3). My bonuses will become: WHITE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1, BLUE 1. This puts me at 1 each for WHITE, BLUE, BLACK towards N6. I also have 2 RED bonuses, which helps for N5 (RED 4, BLACK 4). This purchase advances my engine efficiently, uses exactly the tokens I have, and prevents opponent from possibly taking L1_9 (though they have other priorities). Alternative: I could take tokens to aim for a higher card, but I'm at 4 tokens, so taking 3 would bring me to 7, which is fine, but purchasing now is more productive as it gives a bonus and reduces token count. I could also consider L1_25 (GREEN bonus, cost similar), but GREEN is less important for my nobles (N6 needs BLUE, N5 needs RED/BLACK, N8 needs WHITE/GREEN/BLUE). BLUE is more critical. Also, L1_9 is cheaper after bonuses. Therefore, purchase L1_9.

======================================================================================

Turn 14 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=4, GRN=4, BLK=1}
Reasoning: Let me analyze my current position:

**Current Position:**
- Tokens: WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (6 tokens total)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, GREEN:1
- Reserved: L1_15 (BLUE bonus, needs BLACK:3), L1_34 (RED bonus, needs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1)
- Purchased: L1_28 (GREEN bonus), L1_20 (WHITE bonus), L1_23 (WHITE bonus)
- Score: 0

**Strategic Analysis toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3 = 3 points):**
- Current effective tokens: WHITE:4 (2 tokens + 2 bonus), GREEN:4 (3 tokens + 1 bonus), BLUE:0
- I'm missing the BLUE component entirely!
- L1_15 gives BLUE bonus - this is exactly what I need

**Can I purchase L1_15 now?**
- Cost: BLACK:3
- I have BLACK:1 token + WHITE:2 bonus
- Effective BLACK: 1 token + 2 WHITE bonus = 3 total ✓

**Why purchase L1_15:**
1. Gives BLUE bonus (critical for N8 requirement)
2. Costs only BLACK tokens (which I'm low on and need to use)
3. After purchase: WHITE:0, BLUE:1 bonus, GREEN:3, BLACK:1, GOLD:0 (4 tokens)
4. With BLUE bonus, effective BLUE becomes 1
5. Positioned perfectly to take BLUE tokens next turn

**Why not other options:**
- L1_34 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 - I have 0 BLUE
- Taking tokens: I'd take BLUE tokens, but need 3 and only 3 available. Better to get the bonus first

**Final action: PURCHASE L1_15 using WHITE bonuses as BLACK substitutes**
This gives me the BLUE bonus I desperately need for N8.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_15]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_15
Reasoning: I'm player 1 with 6 tokens (WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:3, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1. My goal is 15 prestige points.

**Target Analysis:**
- L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3) - I have only 1 BLACK, need 2 more but only 2 available on board
- L1_34 (RED bonus, costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1) - I can afford this with: WHITE:2+2=4, BLUE:0+1=1, GREEN:3+1=4, BLACK:1+1=2

**Action: Take 3 tokens**
Taking WHITE, BLUE, and GREEN:
- WHITE: 2+1 = 3 (meets L1_34 requirement)
- BLUE: 0+1 = 1 (meets L1_34 requirement)  
- GREEN: 3+1 = 4 (meets L1_34 requirement)
- BLACK: 1 (unchanged, still meets L1_34 requirement)

After this: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, BLACK:1 (7 tokens)

**Next Turn:** I'll purchase L1_34 (RED bonus), then work toward L1_15 (BLACK:3) and target N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) for 3 prestige points.

This efficiently builds toward my reserved cards while staying under the 10-token limit (7 < 10).

Turn 15 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 1. Total tokens: 3. Bonuses: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I have 1 prestige point. My goals are to pursue nobles N6 (WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3), N5 (RED 4, BLACK 4), and N8 (WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3). I currently lack GREEN tokens and need more WHITE, BLUE, BLACK tokens. Available tokens on board: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 0, RED 4, BLACK 2, GOLD 5. I cannot take WHITE or GREEN because they are at 0. I can take 2 tokens of the same color if available (BLUE has 2, RED has 4, BLACK has 2). However, taking 2 of the same color requires at least 4 tokens on board for that color. RED has 4, so I can take 2 RED tokens. Alternatively, I can take 3 different colors from available ones: BLUE, RED, BLACK are available (each at least 1). But I must take EXACTLY 3 different colors. Since WHITE and GREEN are unavailable, I can take BLUE, RED, BLACK. That would give me 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK. That is a valid TAKE_TOKENS action. My token count would become: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 2. Total tokens: 6, which is under 10. This gathers resources for future purchases. Alternatively, taking 2 RED tokens would give me RED tokens which I might not need as urgently (I already have 2 RED bonuses). But RED tokens can be used for purchasing cards that require RED. However, my immediate engine needs more BLUE and BLACK for N6 and N5. Taking 2 RED would give me 2 RED tokens, but I'd have to return tokens if I take 2? No, taking 2 tokens of the same color is allowed if at least 4 are on board. That would increase my token count by 2, so total 5, no returns. But I should consider which cards I can purchase soon. Looking at face-up cards: L1_12 (BLUE bonus, cost BLUE 1, GREEN 3, RED 1) - I have BLUE bonus 1, so cost reduces by 1 BLUE? Actually, the bonus is for BLUE, so it reduces BLUE cost. The cost is BLUE 1, GREEN 3, RED 1. With my BLUE bonus 1, I pay 0 BLUE, need 3 GREEN (I have 0), 1 RED. Not affordable. L1_5 (BLACK bonus, cost GREEN 2, RED 1) - I have BLACK bonus 1, but cost doesn't include BLACK, so no reduction. I need 2 GREEN, 1 RED. Not affordable. L1_25 (GREEN bonus, cost WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1) - With bonuses: WHITE 1 covers WHITE, BLUE 1 covers BLUE, RED 2 covers RED, BLACK 1 covers BLACK. So effectively cost 0 of each? Actually, each cost is 1, and I have at least 1 bonus in each, so I could purchase L1_25 for free? But I need to pay tokens for costs not covered by bonuses. Wait: The cost is WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1. My bonuses: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. So for each color, I subtract my bonus from the cost: WHITE: 1 - 1 = 0, BLUE: 1 - 1 = 0, RED: 1 - 2 = 0 (cannot go negative), BLACK: 1 - 1 = 0. So the net cost is 0 tokens! I can purchase L1_25 right now without spending any tokens. That would give me a GREEN bonus and 0 prestige. But I have 0 GREEN tokens to pay? Actually, since net cost is 0, I don't need to pay any tokens. That's a valid purchase. However, is that a good move? It gives a GREEN bonus, which helps for noble N8 (needs GREEN 3) and also for future green cards. But I already have 1 GREEN bonus? No, my bonuses are WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I have 0 GREEN bonus. So acquiring a GREEN bonus would be useful. But L1_25 gives 0 prestige. I could purchase it now and then take tokens later. Alternatively, I could take tokens now and purchase later. But purchasing now would increase my bonuses and reduce the need for tokens in future purchases. Since I have only 3 tokens, purchasing L1_25 would not change my token count, and I'd get a GREEN bonus. That seems efficient because it uses my existing bonuses to get a new bonus for free. Also, it denies the opponent from possibly taking it. However, I should check if there are any other cards I can purchase with my current tokens and bonuses. L1_3 (BLACK bonus, cost WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1). With bonuses: WHITE 2 - 1 = 1 WHITE needed, BLUE 2 - 1 = 1 BLUE needed, RED 1 - 2 = 0 RED needed. So I need 1 WHITE token and 1 BLUE token. I have WHITE 1 and BLUE 1, so I can also purchase L1_3 right now. That would give another BLACK bonus, which helps for N5 and N6. But L1_3 gives 0 prestige. Comparing L1_25 and L1_3, both are affordable. Which is more beneficial? For nobles: N6 requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3. I have WHITE 1, BLACK 1, BLUE 1. Adding L1_3 gives BLACK +1, so BLACK becomes 2. Adding L1_25 gives GREEN +1, which doesn't directly help N6 but helps N8. N5 requires RED 4, BLACK 4. I have RED 2, BLACK 1. Adding L1_3 gives BLACK +1, making BLACK 2. Adding L1_25 doesn't help N5. N8 requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3. I have WHITE 1, GREEN 0, BLUE 1. Adding L1_25 gives GREEN +1, making GREEN 1. Adding L1_3 doesn't help N8. So both have merits. However, I already have 2 RED bonuses, which is good for N5, but I lack BLACK. So maybe L1_3 is slightly better for N5 and N6. But L1_25 gives GREEN, which I currently lack. Also, note that the board has GREEN tokens at 0, so acquiring a GREEN bonus might help me buy green cards without needing green tokens. But green tokens are scarce. I could purchase either. However, I should also consider that my opponent has reserved cards and might be building something. They have WHITE 2 and GREEN 1 bonuses, so they might aim for N8 as well. Acquiring GREEN bonus could be strategic. But let's think about the opportunity cost. If I purchase L1_25 now, I can still take tokens later to aim for higher cards. Purchasing L1_3 would also be fine. But wait, I should also consider the prestige points. Neither gives prestige. But I need to start scoring more points. I have only 1 prestige so far. There are face-up level 2 cards that give prestige. For example, L2_54 (WHITE bonus, 1 prestige, cost WHITE 2, BLUE 3, RED 3). With my bonuses: WHITE 2 - 1 = 1 WHITE, BLUE 3 - 1 = 2 BLUE, RED 3 - 2 = 1 RED. So I need 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. I have WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 0, so I need more BLUE and RED. Taking tokens now could help me get there. Alternatively, L2_48 (BLUE bonus, 1 prestige, cost BLUE 2, GREEN 3, BLACK 3). With bonuses: BLUE 2 - 1 = 1 BLUE, GREEN 3 - 0 = 3 GREEN, BLACK 3 - 1 = 2 BLACK. I need 1 BLUE, 3 GREEN, 2 BLACK. I have BLUE 1, GREEN 0, BLACK 1, so far off. L2_51 (BLUE bonus, 2 prestige, cost BLUE 5). With BLUE bonus 1, need 4 BLUE. I have 1 BLUE, so need 3 more. L2_63 (GREEN bonus, 2 prestige, cost GREEN 5). With GREEN bonus 0, need 5 GREEN. Not close. So the most affordable level 2 card might be L2_54 if I get more BLUE and RED tokens. I currently have 3 tokens, so taking tokens is necessary anyway. If I purchase a level 1 card now, I'll still have 3 tokens, and I can take tokens next turn. But if I take tokens now, I might be able to purchase L2_54 sooner. However, purchasing L1_25 or L1_3 now would increase my bonuses, making future purchases cheaper. For L2_54, after purchasing L1_25 (GREEN bonus) doesn't help because L2_54 doesn't require GREEN. After purchasing L1_3 (BLACK bonus) doesn't help L2_54 either. So neither level 1 card directly reduces the cost of L2_54. But they might help with other cards. I think the optimal play is to purchase a card now because it's free (L1_25 or L1_3) and increases my engine. But wait, I must check if I can actually purchase them. For L1_25, the cost is WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1. My bonuses cover all, so net cost 0. I don't need to pay any tokens. That means I can purchase it without spending tokens, and my token count remains the same. That is very efficient. For L1_3, I need to spend 1 WHITE and 1 BLUE token. I have those, so I can purchase it, leaving me with WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 1. That would reduce my tokens to 1, which is low, but then I can take tokens next turn. Both are valid. Which is better? Purchasing L1_25 keeps my tokens intact (still 3), so I have more flexibility next turn. Purchasing L1_3 uses up my WHITE and BLUE tokens, leaving me with only BLACK. But I gain a BLACK bonus. I think keeping tokens might be better because I can then take more tokens and aim for a higher card. However, taking tokens now might be more urgent because the board has limited tokens. For example, BLUE has only 2 left, RED has 4, BLACK has 2. If I don't take them, opponent might take them. But opponent has 3 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 4 GREEN, 1 BLACK, and they might take tokens as well. They have many tokens already (total 9), so they might be close to purchasing something. I should maybe take tokens to deny them resources. But I can also purchase a card to advance my engine. Let's evaluate the options: Option 1: Purchase L1_25 (free). Then my bonuses become WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1, GREEN 1. Tokens remain WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 1. Next turn, I can take tokens (e.g., BLUE, RED, BLACK) to build towards L2_54. Option 2: Purchase L1_3 (cost 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE). Bonuses become WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 2. Tokens become WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 1. Next turn, I can take tokens, but I'll have fewer starting tokens. Option 3: Take tokens now (e.g., BLUE, RED, BLACK). Then next turn I might be able to purchase L2_54 if I get the right tokens. But after taking tokens, I would have WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 2. Then I need 1 WHITE (have), 2 BLUE (have), 1 RED (have) for L2_54. Wait, that's exactly what I would have! After taking BLUE, RED, BLACK, I would have BLUE 2, RED 1, plus existing WHITE 1, so I would have the exact tokens needed for L2_54. Let's verify: L2_54 cost: WHITE 2, BLUE 3, RED 3. Bonuses: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2. Net cost: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, RED 1. After taking tokens, I would have WHITE 1, BLUE 2, RED 1. So I could purchase L2_54 next turn! That would give me 1 prestige point and a WHITE bonus. That is a strong move because it scores points and advances my WHITE bonus for nobles. So if I take tokens now (BLUE, RED, BLACK), next turn I can purchase L2_54. That seems more efficient than purchasing a level 1 card with 0 prestige. Also, purchasing L2_54 would bring my prestige to 2, and my WHITE bonus to 2, which is great for N6 and N8. So I should prioritize that. Therefore, I should take tokens now to set up the purchase of L2_54. However, I must ensure that taking tokens is valid. Available tokens: BLUE 2, RED 4, BLACK 2. All are at least 1, so taking one of each is valid. I will take 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK. That increases my token count by 3, from 3 to 6. No returns needed. This is a solid plan. I should not purchase L1_25 or L1_3 now because that would use tokens or not advance my prestige. Taking tokens to immediately set up a prestige card is better. Also, note that L2_54 is available on the board. I must confirm it's not reserved by opponent. It's in face-up cards, so it's available. So my action: TAKE_TOKENS with take_BLUE=1, take_RED=1, take_BLACK=1. All others 0. No returns.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 15 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, BLU=1, GRN=5, BLK=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 9 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1. My reserved cards are:
- L1_15: Needs BLACK:3 (I have 1 BLACK token)
- L1_34: Costs WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 (I have WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:5, BLACK:2 including bonuses)

**Strategic Analysis:**
I can afford L1_34! With bonuses applied:
- WHITE: 3 tokens + 2 bonus = 5 available (need 2)
- BLUE: 1 token + 1 bonus = 2 available (need 1) ✓
- GREEN: 4 tokens + 1 bonus = 5 available (need 1) ✓
- BLACK: 1 token + 1 bonus = 2 available (need 1) ✓

**Action: PURCHASE L1_34**
This gives me a RED bonus, moving me toward my goal of collecting diverse gem bonuses. After this purchase:
- I'll have RED:1 bonus (new color!)
- Tokens reduce from 9 to 5
- Bonuses become WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1

**Why not take tokens?**
- Board has WHITE:0, GREEN:0 (depleted), so I can only take RED, BLUE, BLACK
- Taking 3 tokens would push me to 12 tokens, requiring 3 returns - wasteful
- L1_34 gives me a new RED bonus which helps for Level 2+ cards

**Future Planning:**
With RED:1 bonus, I'll work toward L1_15 (BLACK:3, gives BLUE bonus) then target N6 (WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3) for 3 prestige points. My token spread of WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, BLACK:0 will position me well.

Turn 16 - Player 0's move
Points: 1, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE 1, BLUE 2, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 2. Total tokens: 1+2+0+1+2 = 6. Bonuses: WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I have 1 prestige point. I previously planned to take tokens to set up purchasing L2_54. Now I have exactly the tokens needed: L2_54 cost: WHITE 2, BLUE 3, RED 3. After applying bonuses: WHITE 2 - 1 = 1 WHITE needed, BLUE 3 - 1 = 2 BLUE needed, RED 3 - 2 = 1 RED needed. I have WHITE 1 token, BLUE 2 tokens, RED 1 token, so I can afford it. Purchasing L2_54 will cost me 1 WHITE, 2 BLUE, 1 RED. After purchase, my tokens will become: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 2. Total tokens: 2. This reduces my token count significantly, freeing space for future token acquisition. L2_54 gives 1 prestige point (bringing me to 2) and a WHITE bonus (bringing my WHITE bonus to 2). This advances me toward noble N6 (needs WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3) and N8 (needs WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3). It also scores points efficiently. Alternatives: I could purchase L1_25 for free (0 tokens), but it gives 0 prestige and a GREEN bonus. While that helps for N8, scoring points now is more important. I could also take tokens, but I'm at 6 tokens, and taking more would bring me closer to 10. Purchasing is better to avoid waste and score points. Also, L2_54 is a good card that might be taken by opponent if I delay. My opponent has many tokens and might be close to purchasing something, so I should secure this prestige card now.

Turn 16 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=5, GRN=5, RED=1}
Reasoning: I can afford L1_3! This card costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 and gives a BLACK bonus.

With my bonuses:
- WHITE: 3 tokens + 2 bonus = 5 available, need 2 ✓
- BLUE: 0 tokens + 1 bonus = 1 available, need 2 (not enough!)

Wait, let me recalculate. L1_3 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1. With my bonuses:
- WHITE: 3 tokens + 2 bonus = 5 available (need 2) ✓
- BLUE: 0 tokens + 1 bonus = 1 available (need 2) ✗

Actually I need 2 more BLUE which I don't have! I should check what I can actually afford:

L1_25 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 - I have WHITE:3, GREEN:4, RED:4, BLACK:0, BLUE:0 with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1
- WHITE: 3+2=5 (need 1) ✓
- GREEN: 4+1=5 (not needed)
- RED: 4+1=5 (need 1) ✓
- BLUE: 0+1=1 (need 1) ✓
- BLACK: 0+0=0 (need 1) ✗

L1_5 costs GREEN:2, RED:1 - I have GREEN:4+1=5, RED:4+1=5 ✓

L1_12 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1 - BLUE:0+1=1 (need 1) ✓, GREEN:4+1=5 (need 3) ✓, RED:4+1=5 (need 1) ✓

L1_5 is the best purchase - costs only GREEN:2, RED:1 for a BLACK bonus, and I can afford it easily!
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_3]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L1_3
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 7 tokens (WHITE:3, GREEN:4, RED:0, BLUE:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1. My reserved card L1_15 costs BLACK:3 and gives a BLUE bonus.

**Strategic Analysis:**
- I have 0 BLACK tokens, but the board has BLACK:2 available
- Taking 2 BLACK tokens is valid (only option for same-color takes of 2)
- Current: 7 tokens + 2 = 9 tokens (under limit, no returns needed)
- After taking: BLACK:2
- Next turn I can purchase L1_15

**Why not other options:**
- Taking 3 different tokens (WHITE, BLUE, RED) would be 7+3=10 tokens
- But I need BLACK for L1_15, and there's no other way to get BLACK (BLUE=0 on board)
- Taking 2 BLACK is more efficient than taking 3 different tokens

**Final Action: TAKE 2 BLACK tokens**
This sets me up to purchase L1_15 next turn, getting a BLUE bonus that helps toward N6 (WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3). After this I'll have WHITE:3, GREEN:4, BLACK:2 (9 tokens), then purchase L1_15 to reduce to 7 tokens with BLUE:1 bonus.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLACK=2}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot take 2 BLACK tokens: only 2 available (need 4).
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 9 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, BLACK:1, GOLD:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1. My reserved card L1_15 costs BLACK:3 (I have 1 BLACK token + 1 bonus = 2, need 1 more).

**Board Analysis:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:1, BLUE:4, GREEN:0, RED:4, BLACK:2
- GREEN is depleted on board, so I cannot take GREEN tokens
- I can take 3 different tokens: WHITE, BLUE, and RED

**Why TAKE_TOKENS:**
I need to accumulate BLACK tokens to purchase L1_15 (BLUE bonus). Since GREEN is unavailable, taking WHITE, BLUE, and RED positions me well:
- After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:2, GREEN:4, BLACK:1, RED:1 (10 tokens - at limit but OK)
- With bonuses: WHITE:6, BLUE:3, GREEN:5, BLACK:2, RED:2

**Purchasing L1_25:**
I can afford L1_25 (GREEN bonus, costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1):
- WHITE: 3 + 2 = 5 (need 1) ✓
- BLUE: 1 + 1 = 2 (need 1) ✓
- RED: 0 + 1 = 1 (need 1) ✓
- BLACK: 1 + 1 = 2 (need 1) ✓

However, taking tokens now is better than purchasing because:
- GREEN is depleted on board - this is my only chance to take RED, BLUE, WHITE together
- L1_25 will still be available next turn
- I need BLACK tokens more urgently than another GREEN bonus

**Strategic Planning:**
- Next turn: Purchase L1_25 (GREEN bonus), leaving me at 6 tokens
- Then focus on accumulating BLACK tokens for L1_15 (BLUE bonus)
- N6 (WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3) remains my target noble
- With BLACK:2 after L1_25 purchase, I only need 1 more BLACK to complete L1_15

This action efficiently builds toward my reserved card while maximizing token acquisition opportunity before GREEN refills.

======================================================================================

Turn 17 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=1, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: My current tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 0, BLACK 2. Total: 2. Bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I have 2 prestige points. I need to acquire more tokens to purchase further cards. Available tokens on board: WHITE 0, BLUE 3, GREEN 0, RED 3, BLACK 2. I cannot take WHITE or GREEN because they are at 0. I can take 3 different colors from BLUE, RED, BLACK, each available. Taking BLUE, RED, BLACK gives me 1 each, increasing my token count to 5, well under 10. This sets me up for future purchases like L1_3 (cost WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1; after bonuses: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, RED 0, needing 1 BLUE token) or L1_25 (cost WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1; after bonuses: all 0, so free). Taking tokens now is efficient because the board has limited tokens, and my opponent has many tokens (10 total) and may take them soon. I should also consider reserving a card, but I have no reserved cards and could benefit from reserving a high-value card. However, I have only 2 tokens, so reserving would give me a gold token, but I might be better off acquiring resources first. Alternatively, I could purchase L1_25 for free now, but I want to keep my token count low to take more tokens. Actually, purchasing L1_25 would give me a GREEN bonus (currently 0) and cost 0 tokens, leaving my token count at 2. That is also a good move because it advances my engine without using tokens. However, taking tokens now might be more urgent to deny opponent resources, especially since BLUE and RED are available in good numbers. But my opponent is likely to take tokens as well. I think purchasing L1_25 is efficient because it's free and gives a bonus, but I already have 2 tokens, and taking tokens would bring me to 5, which is still low. I should aim to purchase a card that gives prestige soon. Looking at face-up cards, L2_48 (BLUE bonus, 1 prestige, cost BLUE 2, GREEN 3, BLACK 3) is not affordable. L2_51 (BLUE bonus, 2 prestige, cost BLUE 5) is not close. L2_63 (GREEN bonus, 2 prestige, cost GREEN 5) not close. L2_43 (BLACK bonus, 2 prestige, cost BLUE 1, GREEN 4, RED 2) - after bonuses: BLUE 1 - 1 = 0, GREEN 4 - 0 = 4, RED 2 - 2 = 0, so need 4 GREEN tokens. I have 0 GREEN tokens and GREEN tokens on board are 0, so not feasible. Level 3 cards are expensive. So the next affordable card might be L1_3 or L1_12 or L1_5. L1_12 requires 3 GREEN, not feasible. L1_5 requires 2 GREEN, 1 RED, not feasible. L1_3 requires WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1. After bonuses: WHITE 2 - 2 = 0, BLUE 2 - 1 = 1, RED 1 - 2 = 0, so need 1 BLUE token. I have 0 BLUE tokens currently. If I take tokens now (BLUE, RED, BLACK), I would have 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK, plus existing BLACK 2. Then I could purchase L1_3 next turn using 1 BLUE token. That gives 0 prestige but a BLACK bonus, which helps for nobles N5 and N6. Alternatively, if I purchase L1_25 now, I would have GREEN bonus 1, and tokens remain 2. Then I could take tokens next turn. But L1_25 is free, so I could do both: purchase L1_25 now, then take tokens next turn. That seems more efficient because I get an extra bonus now without spending tokens. However, I must consider that my opponent might take L1_25 if I don't purchase it now. But they have reserved a card already and may be focusing on other things. I think purchasing L1_25 is a good immediate move because it uses my bonuses effectively and gives me a GREEN bonus, which I lack. Then next turn I can take tokens. So I should purchase L1_25. Wait, but my reasoning says I should take tokens. Let me re-evaluate. Purchasing L1_25: action_type PURCHASE_CARD, card_id L1_25. That would give me GREEN bonus, and my token count stays at 2. That is a solid move. Taking tokens would give me resources but delay engine building. Since L1_25 is free, it's essentially a free bonus. I should take it. However, I need to ensure the card is still available. It is in face-up cards. So I will purchase L1_25.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 0 WHITE, 0 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 0 RED, 2 BLACK tokens. Total tokens: 2. Bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I need to acquire tokens to purchase cards. Available tokens on board: WHITE 0, BLUE 3, GREEN 0, RED 3, BLACK 2. I cannot take WHITE or GREEN because they are 0. I can take 2 tokens of the same color if at least 4 are available: RED has 3, not enough; BLUE has 3, not enough; BLACK has 2, not enough. So I cannot take 2 of the same color. I must take 3 different colors from those available: BLUE, RED, BLACK are available (each at least 1). That is valid. Taking 1 BLUE, 1 RED, 1 BLACK would give me tokens I need for future purchases. My token count would become: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 3. Total tokens: 5, well under 10. This gathers resources for purchasing cards like L1_3 or L1_25, or saving for higher cards. I could also consider reserving a card, but I have no reserved cards and could use a gold token. However, reserving might slow me down. Taking tokens is more urgent to build my engine. I should avoid returning tokens, so taking 3 is fine. After taking tokens, I can next turn purchase a card like L1_25 (free) or L1_3 (costs tokens). I'll take BLUE, RED, BLACK.

======================================================================================

Turn 17 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=5, RED=2}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1. My reserved card L1_15 costs BLACK:3 (gives BLUE bonus).

**Critical Problem:** I cannot take tokens (at 10 limit), and I cannot afford L1_15 (need 3 BLACK, have 0 tokens + 1 bonus = 1). Board has only 1 BLACK available anyway.

**Board Analysis:**
- WHITE:0, GREEN:0 (depleted) - cannot take these colors
- Limited token options: BLUE:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5

**Why RESERVE L1_25?**
1. Taking tokens is impossible (at limit)
2. Purchasing L1_12 is not helpful - BLUE bonus doesn't help with BLACK requirement
3. Reserving L1_25 gives me a gold token, reducing me to 6 tokens
4. L1_25 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1 - with GOLD could be affordable later
5. GREEN bonus is valuable for Level 2+ cards

**Strategic Value:**
- Getting to 6 tokens frees me to take tokens next turn
- GOLD token is versatile for any purchase
- I preserve flexibility while escaping the token trap
- Next turn I can assess taking BLUE, RED, BLACK tokens toward L1_15 or target a different strategy
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_25, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: My previous action was invalid - I attempted to reserve a card which gave me a gold token, but exceeded the 10-token limit. Let me correct this.

Current state: I have 9 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, BLACK:1, RED:0, GOLD:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1.

I can afford L1_25 with my bonuses:
- WHITE: 3+2=5 (need 1) ✓
- BLUE: 1+1=2 (need 1) ✓
- RED: 0+1=1 (need 1) ✓
- BLACK: 1+1=2 (need 1) ✓

L1_25 gives a GREEN bonus, which helps me work toward N6 (WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3) for 3 prestige points.

By purchasing instead of taking tokens, I stay at 6 tokens (9-3 spent), well under the limit. This is more efficient than risking token limit issues.

After purchase: Bonuses become WHITE:2, GREEN:2, RED:1 with tokens at WHITE:2, BLUE:0, GREEN:4, BLACK:0, RED:0. Then I can focus on accumulating BLACK tokens for L1_15 (BLUE bonus, costs BLACK:3).
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_25, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:4, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1. I cannot take more tokens at limit.

**Board Analysis:**
- Available: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:1
- L1_12 costs BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1 and gives a BLUE bonus
- I can afford this with bonuses!

**Purchase Calculation:**
- GREEN: 4 tokens + 1 bonus = 5 available (need 3) ✓
- RED: 1 token + 1 bonus = 2 available (need 1) ✓
- BLUE: 1 token + 0 bonus = 1 available (need 1) ✓
- After purchase: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:0 (6 tokens)

**Strategic Value:**
- Gets BLUE:1 bonus (new bonus color!)
- Reduces token count from 10 to 6 efficiently
- Moves me toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
- I keep my GOLD token for higher-level cards

**Why not reserve?:**
- Reserving gives 1 gold (11 tokens, need to return 1) - wasteful
- L1_12 is affordable now and gives immediate benefit
- Better to purchase than reserve at token limit

======================================================================================

Turn 18 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I currently have tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 3. Total tokens: 5. Bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. I have 2 prestige points. I can purchase L1_25 (GREEN bonus, cost WHITE 1, BLUE 1, RED 1, BLACK 1). Applying bonuses: WHITE cost 1 reduced by WHITE bonus 2 => 0, BLUE cost 1 reduced by BLUE bonus 1 => 0, RED cost 1 reduced by RED bonus 2 => 0, BLACK cost 1 reduced by BLACK bonus 1 => 0. Net cost is 0 tokens. This purchase gives me a GREEN bonus (bringing my GREEN bonus to 1) and 0 prestige, but it advances my engine for free, without spending any tokens. This is highly efficient because it uses my existing bonuses to acquire a new bonus that I lack. This GREEN bonus is crucial for noble N8 (requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3). After purchase, my bonuses will be WHITE 2, BLUE 1, RED 2, BLACK 1, GREEN 1. I will still have 5 tokens, so I can take tokens next turn to aim for higher cards. Alternatives: I could purchase L1_3 (BLACK bonus, cost WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1). Applying bonuses: WHITE 2 - 2 = 0, BLUE 2 - 1 = 1, RED 1 - 2 = 0. So I need 1 BLUE token. I have 1 BLUE token, so I could purchase L1_3 for 1 BLUE token. That would give a BLACK bonus, bringing BLACK bonus to 2, which helps for nobles N5 and N6. However, that would spend my only BLUE token, leaving me with fewer tokens for future purchases. L1_25 is free, so it's better to preserve tokens. I could also consider reserving a card or taking tokens. Taking tokens: available tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 3, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1. I could take 3 different colors: BLUE, GREEN, RED are available (each at least 1). That would give me 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED, bringing my token count to 8. But then I wouldn't be advancing my engine this turn. Purchasing L1_25 now is more productive because it gives a bonus and doesn't cost tokens. Also, it denies the opponent from possibly taking L1_25 (though they have other priorities). After purchasing L1_25, I can next turn take tokens to aim for a higher prestige card. For example, L2_43 (BLACK bonus, 2 prestige, cost BLUE 1, GREEN 4, RED 2) is affordable after acquiring more tokens. Or I could aim for nobles. My current progress toward nobles: N6 requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3. I have WHITE 2, BLACK 1, BLUE 1. Need more BLACK and BLUE. N5 requires RED 4, BLACK 4. I have RED 2, BLACK 1. Need more RED and BLACK. N8 requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3. I have WHITE 2, GREEN 1, BLUE 1. Need more GREEN and BLUE. Acquiring GREEN bonus helps N8. So purchasing L1_25 is beneficial. Therefore, I will purchase L1_25.

Turn 18 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=3, RED=2}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 7 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. My reserved L1_15 costs BLACK:3 (I need BLACK tokens).

**Board Analysis:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:5
- WHITE is depleted, so I cannot take WHITE tokens
- Taking 3 different tokens maximizes my token count efficiently

**Action: TAKE_TOKENS (BLACK, GREEN, BLUE)**
- BLACK: 0+1 = 1 (need 2 more for L1_15)
- GREEN: 2+1 = 3 (toward N8 requirement)
- BLUE: 0+1 = 1 (toward N8 requirement)
- After: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:1, BLACK:1 (9 tokens, under limit)

**Why not purchase?:**
- L1_5: BLACK bonus, costs GREEN:2, RED:1 - I can afford this! But I need BLACK tokens more
- L1_6: BLACK bonus, costs WHITE:2, GREEN:2 - I have WHITE:4+2=6, GREEN:2+1=3, but need BLACK tokens
- My priority is accumulating BLACK for L1_15 (BLUE bonus)

**Strategic Value:**
- This positions me to purchase L1_5 or L1_6 next turn
- Keeps me at 9 tokens, leaving room for one more acquisition
- Works toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) and my reserved L1_15
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Invalid token count. Must take 3 different or 2 matching tokens.
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I have 7 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:0) with bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1. My reserved card L1_15 needs BLACK:3.

**Board Analysis:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:0 (depleted), BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1
- WHITE is depleted so I cannot take WHITE tokens
- Available BLACK:1 (only 1 available)

**Action: PURCHASE L1_5**
L1_5 costs GREEN:2, RED:1 and gives a BLACK bonus.

**Affordability Check:**
- GREEN: 2 tokens + 1 bonus = 3 available (need 2) ✓
- RED: 1 token + 1 bonus = 2 available (need 1) ✓
- After purchase: WHITE:4, BLUE:0, GREEN:0, RED:0, BLACK:0 (5 tokens)

**Strategic Value:**
- Gets BLACK:1 bonus (first step toward my reserved L1_15 which needs BLACK:3)
- Efficient token reduction from 7 to 5
- Leaves me with WHITE tokens for future WHITE-heavy cards like L1_3

**Why not take tokens?:**
- Taking 3 different from BLUE, GREEN, RED would give 10 tokens
- I can only take 1 BLACK (limited by board supply)
- Purchasing gives immediate bonus progress toward L1_15

**Future Planning:**
After this purchase, I'll take tokens focusing on BLACK to continue building toward L1_15. With BLACK:1 bonus from L1_5 plus tokens gathered, I'll be on track to afford my reserved card.

**Alternative consideration:**
I could also take 2 GREEN tokens (both available), reaching 9 tokens. But L1_5 is affordable now and gives a BLACK bonus, which is more valuable than hoarding tokens at limit.

Turn 19 - Player 0's move
Points: 2, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=1, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens (0 WHITE, 1 BLUE, 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 3 BLACK) and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 1. L1_32 costs BLACK 4; after applying my BLACK bonus of 1, I need 3 BLACK tokens, which I have exactly. Purchasing it gives 1 prestige point (bringing me to 3) and a GREEN bonus (increasing GREEN to 2), which advances me toward noble N8 (requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3). Alternatives like L1_10 (free BLUE bonus) or L1_3 (cost 1 BLUE for BLACK bonus) give no prestige, and taking tokens would delay scoring. Securing the point now extends my lead over the opponent (0 prestige) and improves my engine efficiently.

======================================================================================

Turn 19 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I'm player 1 with 6 tokens (WHITE:4, GREEN:1, RED:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1. My reserved card L1_15 needs BLACK:3 (I have BLACK:0 + BLACK:1 bonus = 1, need 2 more).

**Board Analysis:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:0 (depleted), BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:4
- L1_6 (BLACK bonus) costs WHITE:2, GREEN:2
- I can afford this with: WHITE:4+2=6 available (need 2), GREEN:1+1=2 available (need 2) ✓

**Action: PURCHASE L1_6**
This gives me BLACK:2 bonus total (combining with my existing BLACK:1 from L1_5), moving me toward my reserved L1_15 which needs BLACK:3.

After purchase: WHITE:2, GREEN:0, RED:1 (4 tokens)

**Why not take tokens?**
- Taking tokens would delay my progress toward the BLACK bonuses I need
- L1_6 is affordable now and gives immediate benefit
- At 4 tokens after purchase, I'll have room to take tokens next turn

**Future Planning:**
- Next turn: Take BLACK and GREEN tokens (both available)
- L1_6 + L1_5 gives BLACK:2 bonus, making L1_15 (BLACK:3 cost) much closer
- With BLACK:2 bonus + tokens gathered, I'll be on track to afford L1_15
- L1_15 gives BLUE:1 bonus, moving me toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) for 3 prestige points

Turn 20 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 tokens (BLUE 1, RED 1) and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 1. L1_29 (GREEN bonus, cost WHITE 2, BLUE 1) is free after applying my bonuses (WHITE 2 covers WHITE, BLUE 1 covers BLUE). Purchasing it gives me a third GREEN bonus, completing the GREEN requirement for noble N8 (requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3). This significantly advances my engine and denies the opponent, who could also purchase it for free on their turn. While L1_10 is also free, securing the critical GREEN bonus is more valuable for noble progress and limits opponent options. After this purchase, I'll have tokens to take next turn and aim for L2_43 (2 prestige) or other cards.

Turn 20 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=1, GRN=1, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I'm player 1 with 6 tokens (WHITE:4, RED:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2. My reserved card L1_15 needs BLACK:3 cost (I have BLACK:0 + BLACK:2 bonus = 2, need 1 more BLACK).

**Board Analysis:**
- Available tokens: WHITE:0, BLUE:3, GREEN:4, RED:2, BLACK:4
- Taking 3 different tokens: BLUE, GREEN, BLACK is ideal

**Action: TAKE_TOKENS (BLUE, GREEN, BLACK)**
After taking: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1, RED:1, GOLD:1 = 9 tokens

**Why not purchase?**
- L1_33 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 - I could afford with bonuses!
- But reserving gives 1 gold, pushing me to 10 tokens (need to return 1)
- Taking tokens is more efficient for building toward L1_15

**Why not take 2 BLACK tokens?**
- L1_15 needs BLACK:3 cost, and I already have BLACK:2 bonus
- Taking BLUE and GREEN gives me color diversity for future cards
- At 9 tokens, I'll still have room for future moves

**Strategic Value:**
- After this: BLACK:1 + BLACK:2 bonus = BLACK:3, enough to purchase L1_15!
- L1_15 gives BLUE:1 bonus, moving me toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
- With 9 tokens, I can purchase L1_15 next turn or take more tokens

Turn 21 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=2, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=1}
Reasoning: I currently have 2 tokens (BLUE 1, RED 1) and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 1. My goal is to increase my prestige points efficiently. I can purchase L2_43 next turn for 2 prestige if I acquire 1 GREEN token now. Taking tokens this turn allows me to set up for that purchase immediately, scoring points sooner and extending my lead over the opponent (who has 0 prestige). Purchasing a free card like L1_10 or L1_33 now would delay L2_43 by one turn. Taking tokens also avoids returning tokens since I have only 2 tokens, and taking 3 will bring me to 5, well under the limit. I need GREEN for L2_43, and BLUE and BLACK for future purchases and noble progress (N6 and N8). Board tokens available: BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 3. Taking 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK is valid and optimal.

Turn 21 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=2, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I'm player 1 with 8 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2. My reserved card L1_15 costs BLACK:3.

**Purchase Calculation:**
- BLACK: 1 token + 2 bonus = 3 available (need 3) ✓
- After purchase: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0 (5 tokens)

**Why purchase NOW:**
- I have exactly enough BLACK resources to afford L1_15
- Gives BLUE:1 bonus, moving me toward N8 (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
- Reduces token count efficiently from 8 to 5
- L1_15 is my reserved card - I've been building toward this moment!

**Why not take tokens?:**
- WHITE is depleted on board anyway
- Taking tokens would delay my progress
- My BLACK:2 bonus combined with my BLACK:1 token is perfectly aligned for this purchase

**Future Planning:**
- After this: Bonuses become WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- With 5 tokens, I'll have room to take tokens next turn
- Focus on accumulating GREEN and WHITE for N8 noble (needs WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)

Turn 22 - Player 0's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens (WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1) and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 1. L2_43 costs BLUE 1, GREEN 4, RED 2. Applying bonuses: BLUE cost reduced to 0, GREEN cost reduced to 1 (since my GREEN bonus is 3), RED cost reduced to 0. So I need to spend exactly 1 GREEN token, which I have. Purchasing L2_43 gives 2 prestige points (bringing me to 5) and a BLACK bonus (increasing BLACK to 2). This extends my lead over the opponent (0 prestige) and efficiently uses my resources. Alternatives like L1_10 (free but 0 prestige) or other cards are less impactful for scoring. I should secure the points now to accelerate toward 15. After purchase, I will have 4 tokens, leaving room to gather more tokens next turn.

Turn 22 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=3, GRN=2, RED=2, BLK=2}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 7 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2. My score is 0.

**Board Token Analysis:**
- WHITE:0 (depleted - cannot take WHITE!)
- BLUE:1, GREEN:3, RED:2, BLACK:3 available

**Card Affordability Check:**
- L1_10 costs WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1 → Cannot afford (WHITE depleted)
- L1_33 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 → Cannot afford (WHITE depleted)
- L1_3 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 → Cannot afford (WHITE depleted, BLUE:1+2=3 available but need 2)
- L1_36 costs WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 → Cannot afford (WHITE depleted)

Since WHITE is completely depleted and many affordable cards require WHITE, I cannot purchase any face-up cards this turn.

**Token Strategy:**
With WHITE depleted, I need to take tokens from available colors. My options:
- Take 3 different: BLUE, GREEN, RED or GREEN, RED, BLACK
- Take 2 same color: 2 GREEN, 2 RED, or 2 BLACK (all have 2+ available)

I choose: TAKE_TOKENS (GREEN, RED, BLACK)

**Strategic Value:**
- After: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 (10 tokens)
- This positions me to potentially afford L1_10 next turn if WHITE becomes available
- GREEN tokens accumulate toward L2_63 (needs GREEN:5) and future purchases
- Keeps diversity for flexibility

**Why not reserve?:**
- Reserving gives 1 gold but I'd have 11 tokens, need to return 1
- Better to take actual color tokens I need for purchases
- My reserved hand is empty, but I want to build toward L1_10 specifically

**Future Planning:**
- With GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1 + bonuses, I'm working toward L1_10 (WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1)
- Once WHITE becomes available on board, I'll be positioned to purchase L1_10
- L1_10 gives a BLUE bonus, moving me toward N8 noble (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) for 3 prestige points

Turn 23 - Player 0's move
Points: 5, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 4 tokens (BLUE 2, RED 1, BLACK 1) and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. Among affordable cards, L2_48 gives 1 prestige point and a BLUE bonus, which extends my lead to 6 points. The opponent can also afford L2_48 (they have exactly the needed tokens and bonuses), so purchasing it now denies them this point and accelerates my progress. After purchase, I will have 2 tokens, leaving room to gather more next turn. Alternatives like taking tokens or buying free cards delay points and risk opponent taking L2_48.

======================================================================================

Turn 23 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I'll take a different approach from my last reasoning. Instead of taking tokens, I'll reserve L1_33 to get a gold token and save the card for later purchase.

**Strategic Value:**
- L1_33 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 and gives RED:1 bonus
- I can afford this with: WHITE:4+2=6, BLUE:1+2=3, GREEN:2+1=3, BLACK:1+2=3
- Reserving gives me 1 GOLD token for flexibility
- After reserve, I'll have 11 tokens total (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1)

**Token Return Decision:**
With 11 tokens, I need to return 1 token. I'll return GREEN (keeping WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens)

**Why this approach:**
- GOLD token gives wildcard flexibility for future purchases
- L1_33's RED bonus complements my existing bonuses
- This maintains my progress toward N8 noble (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
- I keep WHITE tokens for potential purchases when WHITE becomes available on board

**Future Planning:**
- Next turn, I can take tokens to fill back to 10 (BLUE, GREEN, BLACK likely)
- Or purchase L1_33 directly if I want to burn tokens
- With GOLD:1, I'm better positioned for any expensive cards that appear
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_33, deckLevel=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: Cannot have more than 10 tokens at end of turn. Current: 10, Gaining Gold: 1, Returning: 0
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:2, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2. My score is 0.

**Error Correction:**
My previous turn failed because I tried to take 3 tokens when already at 10 tokens. I cannot take tokens while at token limit without first purchasing.

**Card Affordability Check - L1_10:**
- Cost: WHITE:1, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:1
- WHITE available: 4 tokens + 2 bonus = 6 (need 1) ✓
- GREEN available: 2 tokens + 1 bonus = 3 (need 1) ✓
- RED available: 2 tokens + 1 bonus = 3 (need 2) ✓
- BLACK available: 1 token + 2 bonus = 3 (need 1) ✓

**Action: PURCHASE L1_10**
This is the optimal move because:
1. Reduces token count from 10 to 6, freeing up space for next turn
2. Gives BLUE:1 bonus (combining with existing BLUE:2 for BLUE:3 total)
3. Moves me closer to N8 noble requirement (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
4. Uses my existing resources efficiently - all costs are affordable now

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0 (6 tokens)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- Position: 6 tokens allows me to take 3 tokens next turn (e.g., GREEN:2 + another color)

**Why not reserve?**
- Reserving would give me 11 tokens (10 + 1 gold), requiring me to return 1 token anyway
- Better to purchase a card I can afford now than reserve and risk the gold not helping
- L1_10 is valuable for BLUE bonus progression toward N8

**Future Planning:**
- Next turn: Take 2 GREEN tokens + 1 other color (need GREEN:3 for N8 noble)
- Continue building toward N8 noble (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) for 3 prestige points

Turn 24 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I currently have 1 BLUE token and 1 RED token, with 2 GOLD tokens available. My bonuses are WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. I can purchase L2_63 (cost GREEN 5, prestige 2). After applying my GREEN bonus of 3, I need 2 GREEN tokens. I have 0 GREEN tokens, but I can use 2 GOLD tokens to substitute. I have 2 GOLD tokens available, and I have 2 tokens total, so I can spend them. Purchasing L2_63 gives 2 prestige points, bringing my total to 8, and a GREEN bonus (increasing GREEN to 4). This is efficient scoring and extends my lead. Alternatives: L2_51 (BLUE 5) requires 3 BLUE after bonus (BLUE 2), I have 1 BLUE token, not enough. L2_56 (RED 5, BLACK 3) requires 3 RED and 1 BLACK after bonuses (RED 2, BLACK 2), I have 1 RED, 0 BLACK, insufficient. L2_45 (WHITE 5) requires 3 WHITE after bonus (WHITE 2), I have 0 WHITE, not enough. L1 cards give 0 prestige, less valuable. Taking tokens would delay scoring. I should secure the 2 points now. After purchase, I will have 0 tokens, leaving room to gather more next turn.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_63]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Insufficient tokens to purchase card L2_63
Reasoning: I need to correct my previous illegal move. I attempted to purchase L2_63, which I cannot afford. Let's re-evaluate the game state. I have 2 tokens (BLUE 1, RED 1) and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. I have 6 prestige points. I should consider affordable cards. Check each card:

- L1_3: cost WHITE 2, BLUE 2, RED 1. After bonuses: WHITE cost 0 (bonus 2), BLUE cost 0 (bonus 2), RED cost 0 (bonus 2). I need 0 tokens. This is free. But it gives 0 prestige and a BLACK bonus. Not great for points.
- L1_36: cost WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3. After bonuses: WHITE cost 0, RED cost 0, BLACK cost 1 (bonus 2). I need 1 BLACK token, but I have 0 BLACK tokens. So not affordable.
- L1_33: cost WHITE 1, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1. After bonuses: all costs become 0. Free. But 0 prestige, RED bonus.
- L1_4: cost GREEN 1, RED 3, BLACK 1. After bonuses: GREEN cost 0 (bonus 3), RED cost 1 (bonus 2), BLACK cost 0 (bonus 2). I need 1 RED token, which I have. So I can buy L1_4 for 1 RED token. It gives 0 prestige, BLACK bonus.
- L2_63: cost GREEN 5. After bonuses: GREEN cost 2 (bonus 3). I need 2 GREEN tokens, but I have 0 GREEN tokens. Not affordable.
- L2_51: cost BLUE 5. After bonuses: BLUE cost 3 (bonus 2). I need 3 BLUE tokens, but I have 1. Not affordable.
- L2_56: cost RED 5, BLACK 3. After bonuses: RED cost 3 (bonus 2), BLACK cost 1 (bonus 2). I need 3 RED + 1 BLACK = 4 tokens, I have only RED 1, BLACK 0. Not affordable.
- L2_45: cost WHITE 5. After bonuses: WHITE cost 3 (bonus 2). I need 3 WHITE tokens, I have 0. Not affordable.

Thus, the only affordable cards that give prestige are none among level 2. Wait, I already purchased L2_48 last turn? In the current state, L2_48 is not listed in face-up cards; it must have been purchased by me. Indeed, in my purchased cards, I see L2_48. So I already own it. The board shows new cards after my purchase. I need to check what's available now.

Looking at my purchased cards list: L2_48 is there. So I cannot purchase it again. So my previous attempt to purchase L2_63 was invalid because I couldn't afford it. Now, after my last turn (turn 23?), I purchased L2_48, so my tokens should be: I had 4 tokens (BLUE 2, RED 1, BLACK 1) and purchased L2_48 costing BLUE 2, GREEN 3, BLACK 3. After applying bonuses: BLUE bonus 2 reduces BLUE cost to 0, GREEN bonus 3 reduces GREEN cost to 0, BLACK bonus 2 reduces BLACK cost to 1. So I needed to spend 1 BLACK token. I had BLACK 1, so I spent it. I also had BLUE 2, RED 1, BLACK 1. After spending BLACK 1, I have BLUE 2, RED 1. That matches my current tokens: BLUE 1? Wait, the current state says my tokens are WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 0. So I have BLUE 1, RED 1. That suggests I spent 1 BLUE token as well? Let's recalculate: L2_48 cost: BLUE 2, GREEN 3, BLACK 3. Bonuses: BLUE 2 -> cost BLUE 0, GREEN 3 -> cost GREEN 0, BLACK 2 -> cost BLACK 1. So I need to pay 1 BLACK token only. But I had BLACK 1, so I should have 0 BLACK left. But I also had BLUE 2, RED 1. So after purchase, I should have BLUE 2, RED 1, BLACK 0. But the state shows BLUE 1. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Actually, in my previous reasoning, I said I had 4 tokens: BLUE 2, RED 1, BLACK 1. Then I purchased L2_48, spending BLACK 1, leaving BLUE 2, RED 1. That would be 3 tokens. But the current state says BLUE 1, RED 1. So maybe I spent 1 BLUE token? That doesn't match the cost. Possibly the engine deducted incorrectly? No, I must have miscalculated my bonuses. Let's check my bonuses: before purchasing L2_48, my bonuses were WHITE 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2? Wait, in the previous turn (turn 22), I purchased L2_43, which gave me a BLACK bonus, increasing BLACK to 2. So before purchasing L2_48, my bonuses were BLACK 2. Yes. So the calculation stands. I think the current state is after I purchased L2_48, and the token counts might be off due to my error. Actually, looking at the purchased cards list, L2_48 is there, so I did purchase it. The current tokens are as given: BLUE 1, RED 1. So I have 2 tokens.

Now, what can I afford? As calculated, L1_3, L1_33 are free but 0 prestige. L1_4 requires 1 RED token, which I have, and gives 0 prestige. Not great. I could take tokens to build toward a higher-point card. I need to consider the opponent: they have 0 prestige but many cards and tokens. They could potentially buy a high-point card soon. I need to extend my lead.

I should aim for a card that gives prestige. Check noble requirements: I have bonuses WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. Noble N8 requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3. I am missing 1 WHITE, 1 BLUE. Noble N6 requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3. I am missing 1 WHITE, 1 BLACK, 1 BLUE. So I need WHITE and BLUE bonuses. Also, I need to score points.

Looking at the board, L2_45 gives 2 prestige and requires WHITE 5. After bonuses, I need 3 WHITE tokens. I have 0. L2_51 requires BLUE 5, need 3 BLUE tokens. I have 1. L2_56 requires RED 5, BLACK 3, need 3 RED and 1 BLACK. I have RED 1, BLACK 0. L2_63 requires GREEN 5, need 2 GREEN, I have 0. So none are immediately affordable.

Maybe I should take tokens to build toward one of these. But taking tokens now: I have 2 tokens, so I can take 3 tokens without returning. Board tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 3. I cannot take WHITE because there are 0. So I could take BLUE, GREEN, BLACK, or RED. I need to plan for a specific card. L2_51 (BLUE 5) is attractive because it gives 2 prestige and a BLUE bonus, which helps toward nobles. After bonuses, I need 3 BLUE tokens. I currently have 1 BLUE token. So I need 2 more BLUE. If I take 2 BLUE tokens this turn (since there are 2 available), I would have 3 BLUE tokens. But the rule: I can take 2 tokens of the same color only if there are at least 4 of that color on the board. There are only 2 BLUE, so I cannot take 2 BLUE. So I must take 3 different colors. I could take BLUE, GREEN, and BLACK, for example. That would give me BLUE 2, GREEN 1, BLACK 1, plus my existing BLUE 1, RED 1 -> totals: BLUE 3, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1. Then next turn, I could buy L2_51? After bonuses, cost BLUE 5, bonus BLUE 2 -> need 3 BLUE. I would have 3 BLUE tokens exactly. So I could purchase L2_51 next turn. That would give 2 prestige, bringing me to 8, and a BLUE bonus, bringing BLUE to 3, which completes BLUE for nobles. That's good.

Alternatively, I could take tokens to aim for L2_45 (WHITE 5). But WHITE tokens are 0 on board, so I cannot take any WHITE. So that's not possible now.

Another option: I could reserve a card. But reserving would give me a gold token, which could help. However, I have no reserved slots used; I can reserve up to 3. But reserving might delay points.

Given that I have a lead (6 vs 0), I should focus on securing points quickly. The opponent might be building toward something. Taking tokens to set up L2_51 seems solid. But I need to ensure I take exactly 3 different colors. Since WHITE is unavailable, I'll take BLUE, GREEN, and BLACK. That's valid.

Check token counts after taking: I have 2 tokens now. Taking 3 will bring me to 5 tokens, which is under 10, so no need to return.

Thus, I should take tokens: BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1.

Alternatively, I could purchase a free card like L1_3 or L1_33 to get a bonus, but that gives 0 points. I think taking tokens to get a 2-point card next turn is better.

I'll go with taking tokens.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_48]
Retry attempt 2 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Card L2_48 not found on board or in reserved hand.
Reasoning: I need to correct my previous invalid move. In the current game state, I see that L2_48 is no longer in the face-up cards, meaning it has likely been purchased by the opponent or removed. I must verify which cards are available. Looking at the face-up cards, the LEVEL_2 cards are L2_63, L2_51, L2_56, L2_45. L2_48 is not there. Also, I have no reserved cards. Therefore, I cannot purchase L2_48. I must choose a different action.

My current tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 0. Total 2 tokens.
My bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. Prestige score 6.

I should consider purchasing an affordable card that gives me prestige points. Let's examine the face-up cards:
LEVEL_1: L1_3 (BLACK bonus, 0 prestige, cost WHITE2, BLUE2, RED1) - not affordable.
L1_36 (RED bonus, 0 prestige, cost WHITE1, RED1, BLACK3) - not affordable.
L1_33 (RED bonus, 0 prestige, cost WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, BLACK1) - after bonuses: I have WHITE2 (covers WHITE), BLUE2 (covers BLUE), GREEN3 (covers GREEN), RED2, BLACK2. So I need to pay tokens for: WHITE0, BLUE0, GREEN0, BLACK1? Wait, cost is WHITE1, BLUE1, GREEN1, BLACK1. My bonuses: WHITE2 so WHITE cost reduced to 0; BLUE2 -> BLUE cost 0; GREEN3 -> GREEN cost 0; BLACK2 -> BLACK cost 0. So L1_33 is FREE for me. But it gives 0 prestige and a RED bonus (I already have RED2). It doesn't advance my score.
L1_4 (BLACK bonus, 0 prestige, cost GREEN1, RED3, BLACK1) - after bonuses: GREEN3 covers GREEN1, RED2 covers part of RED3 (need 1 RED token), BLACK2 covers BLACK1. So I need 1 RED token, which I have. So I can afford L1_4 by spending 1 RED token. But again 0 prestige.

LEVEL_2: L2_63 (GREEN bonus, 2 prestige, cost GREEN5) - after GREEN bonus 3, I need 2 GREEN tokens. I have 0 GREEN tokens, so cannot afford.
L2_51 (BLUE bonus, 2 prestige, cost BLUE5) - after BLUE bonus 2, need 3 BLUE tokens. I have 1 BLUE token, so cannot afford.
L2_56 (WHITE bonus, 2 prestige, cost RED5, BLACK3) - after bonuses: RED2 (need 3 RED tokens), BLACK2 (need 1 BLACK token). I have 1 RED token, 0 BLACK tokens, so cannot afford.
L2_45 (BLACK bonus, 2 prestige, cost WHITE5) - after WHITE bonus 2, need 3 WHITE tokens. I have 0 WHITE tokens, so cannot afford.

LEVEL_3: all too expensive.

Thus, no affordable cards give prestige points. I could take tokens to prepare for a future purchase. My token count is 2, so I can take 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I need to plan for which card to buy next. L2_51 (2 prestige) requires 3 more BLUE tokens. L2_63 requires 2 more GREEN tokens. L2_45 requires 3 WHITE tokens. L2_56 requires more RED and BLACK.

I should also consider nobles. I am close to noble N8 (requires WHITE3, GREEN3, BLUE3). My bonuses: WHITE2, GREEN3, BLUE2. So I need 1 more WHITE and 1 more BLUE bonus. Purchasing a WHITE or BLUE bonus card would help. L2_45 gives a BLACK bonus, not WHITE or BLUE. L2_51 gives BLUE bonus, which would give me BLUE3. That would satisfy BLUE requirement. Then I need WHITE1. So focusing on L2_51 is good for noble N8. Also, L2_51 gives 2 prestige.

To afford L2_51, I need 3 more BLUE tokens. I currently have 1 BLUE token. I could take BLUE tokens. However, board has BLUE tokens: 2 available. I cannot take 2 BLUE tokens because there are only 2 on board? Actually, rule says you can take 2 of same color if 4+ available. Here BLUE has 2, so I cannot take 2 BLUE. I must take 3 different colors. So I can take 1 BLUE, and then other colors to prepare for other purchases.

Alternatively, I could reserve a card. But reserving would give me a gold token, and I have 0 gold tokens. However, I have only 2 tokens total, so I could reserve a card and take a gold token, but then I would have 3 tokens (including gold). That might be okay. But reserving a card costs me a turn without immediate benefit.

Given that I have a lead (6 vs 0), I should accelerate my scoring. The opponent has 0 prestige but many bonuses and tokens. I need to secure points quickly.

Maybe I should purchase L1_33 (free) to increase my RED bonus (from 2 to 3) and cycle my hand? But that gives no points.

Better to take tokens to set up for L2_51. Let's take tokens: I need BLUE, and also maybe WHITE for future, or GREEN. Board tokens: WHITE 0 (cannot take), BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 3. Since WHITE is 0, I cannot take WHITE. So I must choose from BLUE, GREEN, RED, BLACK. I want BLUE and GREEN for L2_51 and L2_63. I can take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, and 1 BLACK (or RED). That would give me tokens: BLUE becomes 2, GREEN 1, BLACK 1 (or RED 2). That sets me up for L2_51 (need 3 BLUE total, I will have 2, so need one more) and L2_63 (need 2 GREEN, I will have 1). Not perfect.

Alternatively, I could reserve L2_51 to ensure I get it and also get a gold token. That might be a good move because it denies the opponent, and I can use gold to help purchase later. But I have no reserved slots used, so I can reserve up to 3. Reserving L2_51 would take it from the board, and I get a gold token. Then next turn I can take tokens to afford it. That seems reasonable.

But note: after reserving, I would have 3 tokens (current 2 + 1 gold). That's fine.

However, the opponent might also be aiming for L2_51. They have BLUE bonus 3, so they could afford it with 2 BLUE tokens? Let's check: L2_51 cost BLUE5, opponent BLUE bonus 3 -> need 2 BLUE tokens. They have 1 BLUE token currently, so they need 1 more BLUE token to buy it. They have many tokens (total 9), so they might be able to buy it next turn if they have the tokens. Actually, they have tokens: WHITE4, BLUE1, GREEN2, RED1, BLACK1. They need 2 BLUE tokens, they have 1, so they need 1 more. They could take 1 BLUE token if available. Board has BLUE2, so they could take 1 BLUE and then purchase L2_51. That would give them 2 prestige. That would be bad for me.

Thus, I should either reserve L2_51 to deny them, or purchase it now if I can. But I cannot purchase it now because I lack tokens. So reserving is the best move to deny them and secure it for myself.

Therefore, I will reserve L2_51. This will give me a gold token (since gold tokens available: 5). My token count will become: current 2 + 1 gold = 3 tokens total (still under 10). Then next turn I can take tokens to afford L2_51.

Check: after reserving, I will have reserved cards: L2_51. I will have gold token. Then I can take, say, 2 BLUE tokens if available (but need 4+ on board to take 2, currently BLUE2, so cannot). So I would need to take 3 different colors including BLUE. That will take two turns to gather enough BLUE tokens. But I also have gold token to substitute for one BLUE. So I need 3 BLUE tokens after bonuses. My BLUE bonus is 2, so I need 3 BLUE tokens. With gold token, I can use gold as one BLUE. So I need 2 BLUE tokens and 1 gold, or 3 BLUE tokens. I currently have 1 BLUE token and 0 gold (after reserve I'll have 1 gold). So I need 1 more BLUE token and maybe another token. Actually, to purchase L2_51, cost BLUE5, bonus BLUE2 -> need 3 BLUE tokens or substitutes. I can use gold as BLUE. So I need 3 tokens that are either BLUE or gold. I will have: 1 BLUE token, 1 gold token after reserve. So I need 1 more BLUE token. That means next turn I could take 1 BLUE token (if available) and then purchase. But I cannot take only 1 token; I must take 3 different colors. So I would need to take 1 BLUE and two other colors, which would give me extra tokens. That's okay.

Alternatively, I could purchase a free card like L1_33 now to increase my bonuses and then next turn reserve or take tokens. But that doesn't deny L2_51 from opponent.

Given the opponent's threat, I think reserving L2_51 is the best move. It denies them 2 prestige and secures it for me.

Thus, action: RESERVE_CARD with card_id L2_51.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_48]
Player 0 failed to provide a valid action after 3 retries. Last error: Invalid action: Card L2_48 not found on board or in reserved hand.. Skipping turn.

Turn 24 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2. My score is 0.

**Purchase Analysis - Which cards can I afford?**
- L1_36 costs WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 → WHITE:4+2=6, RED:1+1=2, BLACK:1+2=3 → AFFORDABLE! ✓
- L1_33 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1 → WHITE:4+2=6, BLUE:1+3=4, GREEN:2+1=3, BLACK:1+2=3 → AFFORDABLE! ✓
- L1_3 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 → WHITE:4+2=6, BLUE:1+3=4, RED:1+1=2 → AFFORDABLE! ✓
- L1_4 costs GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1 → GREEN:2+1=3, RED:1+1=2, BLACK:1+2=3 → NOT affordable (need RED:3, have 2)

**L2 Cards:**
- L2_63 needs GREEN:5 → I have GREEN:2+1=3 → NOT affordable
- L2_51 needs BLUE:5 → I have BLUE:1+3=4 → NOT affordable
- L2_56 needs RED:5, BLACK:3 → I have RED:1+1=2, BLACK:1+2=3 → NOT affordable
- L2_45 needs WHITE:5 → I have WHITE:4+2=6 → AFFORDABLE! ✓

**Action Decision: RESERVE L1_33**
This is strategic because:
1. I can afford L1_33 now, but reserving gives me a GOLD token
2. After taking the gold token: 10 tokens (at limit)
3. Next turn, I can purchase L1_33 using the gold token to cover any color
4. L1_33 gives RED:1 bonus, which I need for future purchases (L2_56 needs RED:5)
5. Having a reserved card also protects it from being taken by opponent

**Why not purchase L1_36 instead?**
- L1_36 gives RED:1 bonus
- But reserving L1_33 gives me immediate GOLD token + secures the card
- GOLD tokens are valuable for purchasing expensive cards
- I can still purchase L1_36 next turn if needed

**Post-Action State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens
- Reserved: L1_33
- Bonuses remain: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2

**Future Planning:**
- Next turn, I can purchase my reserved L1_33 using the gold token
- Then take 3 tokens to free up space (GREEN, RED, and another color)
- Build toward L2_56 (RED:5, BLACK:3) for 2 prestige points
- Continue accumulating bonuses for nobles (N5 needs RED:4, BLACK:4)
Action: ReserveCardAction[cardId=L1_33, deckLevel=LEVEL_1, tokensToReturn=null]

======================================================================================

Turn 25 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=2}
Reasoning: I have 2 tokens (BLUE 1, RED 1) and 0 prestige cards purchased this turn. My bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. I need to gather tokens for my next purchase. I'm at 6 prestige points, and my goal is to reach 15 efficiently. Looking at the board, I can afford L2_45 (2 prestige, cost WHITE 5) after applying WHITE bonus of 2, I need 3 WHITE tokens. I have 0 WHITE tokens, so I need to collect WHITE. However, WHITE tokens on board are 0, so I cannot take WHITE. Alternative targets: L2_63 (2 prestige, cost GREEN 5) - I have GREEN bonus 3, need 2 GREEN tokens, but I have 0 GREEN tokens. L2_51 (2 prestige, cost BLUE 5) - BLUE bonus 2, need 3 BLUE tokens, I have 1 BLUE token. L2_56 (2 prestige, cost RED 5, BLACK 3) - RED bonus 2, BLACK bonus 2, need 3 RED and 1 BLACK tokens, I have 1 RED and 0 BLACK. L3 cards are too expensive. I should consider noble progress: I have WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. Noble N6 requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3 - I'm close, need 1 more WHITE, 1 more BLACK, 1 more BLUE. Noble N8 requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3 - need 1 more WHITE, 0 more GREEN, 1 more BLUE. So I need WHITE, BLUE, BLACK. WHITE tokens are unavailable, so I'll focus on BLUE and BLACK. Board tokens: BLUE 2, GREEN 2, RED 2, BLACK 3. I can take 3 different colors: BLUE, GREEN, BLACK. That would give me tokens: BLUE 2, GREEN 1, BLACK 1 (since I currently have BLUE 1, RED 1). That would put me at 5 tokens total, well under 10. This sets me up for future purchases: L2_51 needs BLUE, L2_56 needs RED and BLACK, L2_63 needs GREEN. Also, I could purchase L1_36 (RED bonus) for free with my RED bonus of 2? Cost: WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3. After bonuses: WHITE cost 1 reduced by 2 => 0, RED cost 1 reduced by 2 => 0, BLACK cost 3 reduced by 2 => 1. So I need 1 BLACK token. After taking tokens, I would have BLACK 1, so I could purchase L1_36 next turn for a RED bonus (increasing RED to 3) and 0 prestige. But I'd rather aim for higher prestige cards. Alternatively, I could reserve a card, but I have no reserved cards and might want to keep options open. The opponent has 0 prestige and many tokens, but they are not an immediate threat. I should prioritize gaining tokens to purchase a level 2 card soon. Taking BLUE, GREEN, BLACK is optimal because it gives me flexibility. I avoid taking RED because I already have RED 1 and RED bonus 2, and RED is less critical for nobles. I cannot take WHITE because none available. So I'll take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK.

Turn 25 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=2, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm player 1 with 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:2. My reserved L1_33 costs WHITE:1, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, BLACK:1.

**Purchase Affordability Check:**
- WHITE: 4 tokens + 2 bonus = 6 (need 1) ✓
- BLUE: 1 token + 3 bonus = 4 (need 1) ✓
- GREEN: 2 tokens + 1 bonus = 3 (need 1) ✓
- BLACK: 1 token + 2 bonus = 3 (need 1) ✓
- Use GOLD to cover any remaining cost

**Why PURCHASE L1_33 now:**
1. Reduces token count from 10 to 6, freeing up space for next turn
2. Gives RED:1 bonus (my RED bonus goes from 1 to 2)
3. Positions me closer to N5 noble (RED:4, BLACK:4) - I have BLACK:2 bonus, after this RED:2 bonus
4. Uses my reserved card efficiently - I reserved this last turn specifically to buy it now

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:1, BLACK:0, GOLD:0 = 6 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2
- With 6 tokens, I can take 3 tokens next turn (targeting RED and GREEN for N5 progress)

**Strategic Context:**
- My opponent has 6 points and is ahead; I need to catch up
- Nobles are valuable (3 pts each) - I should qualify for one soon
- N5 needs RED:4, BLACK:4 - I have BLACK:2, will have RED:2 after purchase
- N8 needs WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3 - I have BLUE:3, need WHITE:2 more and GREEN:2 more

Purchasing now is more efficient than reserving another card since I can afford this one immediately.

======================================================================================

Turn 26 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 2 tokens (BLUE 1, RED 1) and 5 tokens total after last turn's action (I took BLUE, GREEN, BLACK? Actually, in my previous reasoning I said I would take BLUE, GREEN, BLACK, but the game state shows I have BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1? Wait, the current game state shows my tokens: BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1. That's 5 tokens total (WHITE 0, BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1). That matches my previous reasoning where I took 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK, and I already had BLUE 1, RED 1, so after taking, I have BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1. So I currently have 5 tokens. Now I need to decide my next move. My bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. I have 6 prestige points. I need to reach 15. Looking at affordable cards: L1_36 (RED bonus) costs WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3. After bonuses: WHITE cost 0 (bonus 2), RED cost 0 (bonus 2), BLACK cost 1 (bonus 2). I have BLACK 1 token, so I can purchase L1_36 for free (since cost after bonuses is 1 BLACK token, which I have). But L1_36 gives 0 prestige points, only a RED bonus. That would increase my RED bonus to 3, which is good for noble N5 (requires RED 4, BLACK 4) but not immediate. Alternatively, I could aim for a level 2 card: L2_63 (2 prestige, cost GREEN 5) - after GREEN bonus 3, I need 2 GREEN tokens. I have 1 GREEN token, so I need 1 more GREEN. L2_51 (2 prestige, cost BLUE 5) - after BLUE bonus 2, I need 3 BLUE tokens. I have 2 BLUE tokens, so I need 1 more BLUE. L2_56 (2 prestige, cost RED 5, BLACK 3) - after RED bonus 2 and BLACK bonus 2, I need 3 RED and 1 BLACK tokens. I have 1 RED and 1 BLACK, so I need 2 more RED and 0 more BLACK? Actually, need 3 RED after bonus? RED cost 5 minus RED bonus 2 = 3 RED tokens needed. BLACK cost 3 minus BLACK bonus 2 = 1 BLACK token needed. I have RED 1, BLACK 1, so I need 2 more RED and 0 more BLACK (since I have 1 already). L2_45 (2 prestige, cost WHITE 5) - after WHITE bonus 2, need 3 WHITE tokens. I have 0 WHITE tokens, and board has 0 WHITE tokens, so not feasible. So the most immediate level 2 card I can afford soon is L2_51 (need 1 more BLUE) or L2_63 (need 1 more GREEN). But I also consider nobles: N6 requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3. I have WHITE 2, BLACK 2, BLUE 2, so I need 1 more each. N8 requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3. I have WHITE 2, GREEN 3, BLUE 2, so I need 1 more WHITE and 1 more BLUE. So BLUE is critical for both nobles. Taking tokens: board tokens available: WHITE 0, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 2. I have 5 tokens, so I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. If I take 3 tokens, I'll have 8 total. I want to collect BLUE and GREEN to enable L2_51 or L2_63. I could take BLUE, GREEN, and another color. Since WHITE is unavailable, I could take RED or BLACK. Taking RED would help for L2_56, but I need 2 more RED, so taking 1 RED is not enough. Taking BLACK would help for nobles and L1_36, but I already have BLACK 1. Actually, I could take BLUE, GREEN, and BLACK. That would give me BLUE 3, GREEN 2, BLACK 2, RED 1, WHITE 0. Then I could purchase L2_51 next turn (need BLUE 3 tokens after bonus? Wait, recalc: L2_51 cost BLUE 5, bonus BLUE 2, so need 3 BLUE tokens. After taking, I would have BLUE 3 tokens, so I could purchase L2_51 immediately next turn for 2 prestige. That's good. Alternatively, L2_63: need 2 GREEN tokens, after taking I would have GREEN 2, so also purchasable. But L2_51 gives BLUE bonus, which would increase my BLUE bonus to 3, helping with nobles. L2_63 gives GREEN bonus, but I already have GREEN 3, so less useful. So I should aim for L2_51. Taking BLUE, GREEN, BLACK sets me up for that. I should check if I can purchase L1_36 now instead? It costs 1 BLACK token, which I have. But it gives 0 prestige, and I would rather save my tokens for a prestige card. Also, purchasing L1_36 would use my BLACK token, leaving me with 4 tokens, and then I could take tokens next turn. But that delays my prestige gain. Better to take tokens now and purchase a level 2 card next turn. So I will take 1 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 BLACK. Board has enough: BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 2. Yes. This is a valid TAKE_TOKENS action. No need to return tokens because 5 + 3 = 8 <= 10.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={BLUE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]

Turn 26 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=6, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. My score is 0.

**Board Token Scarcity:**
- WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:0 (completely depleted!)
- Only RED:2 and BLACK:1 available

**Card Affordability Analysis:**
- L1_22 costs BLUE:2, BLACK:2 → Can afford with bonuses!
- L1_36 costs WHITE:1, RED:1, BLACK:3 → Can afford
- L1_4 costs GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1 → Can afford
- L1_3 costs WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1 → Can afford
- L2 cards require 5+ of single color → Not affordable yet

**Strategic Decision: PURCHASE L1_22**
L1_22 is optimal because:
1. Cost: BLUE:2, BLACK:2
   - My tokens: BLUE:1, BLACK:1
   - Bonuses: BLUE:3, BLACK:2
   - Total available: BLUE:4, BLACK:3 (need 2 each) ✓
   
2. Token Efficiency:
   - Before: 9 tokens → After: 5 tokens
   - Frees up 4 token slots for next turn
   
3. Future Planning:
   - With 5 tokens and WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1 available
   - Next turn: Can take 2 RED + 1 RED (if board refilled) or 2 GREEN + 1 other
   - Working toward N8 noble (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3) - I have BLUE:3, need WHITE:1 more and GREEN:2 more

**Why not take tokens?**
- Taking tokens now wastes a turn since I'm at 9/10 and will be at 10/10
- Better to purchase now and have flexibility next turn
- Board tokens are nearly empty anyway

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1 (5 tokens)
- Bonuses: WHITE:2, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2
- Ready to take 3 tokens next turn

Turn 27 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=5, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens (BLUE 2, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1). My bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 2, BLACK 2. I can purchase L1_36 (RED bonus) for free after applying bonuses: cost WHITE 1, RED 1, BLACK 3. After bonuses: WHITE cost 0 (bonus 2), RED cost 0 (bonus 2), BLACK cost 1 (bonus 2). I have 1 BLACK token, so I can purchase it now. Although it gives 0 prestige, it increases my RED bonus to 3, which helps towards noble N5 (requires RED 4, BLACK 4) and future red-heavy cards. More importantly, purchasing now uses 1 BLACK token, reducing my total tokens to 4, which allows me to take 3 tokens next turn without exceeding 10. This is better than taking tokens now because the board has very few tokens left (BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 2, BLACK 1, WHITE 0). Taking tokens now would force me to take RED and BLACK only, which may not align with my goals. By purchasing L1_36, I free up token space and improve my bonuses. I can then take tokens next turn to aim for L2_51 or L2_63.

Turn 27 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=7, BLU=4, GRN=3, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1) and bonuses WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:1, RED:2, BLACK:2. My score is 0. Opponent has 6 points and is ahead.

**Card Affordability Check - L1_26:**
- Cost: WHITE:1, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:2
- My tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, RED:1, BLACK:1
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, BLACK:2
- Total available: WHITE:7, BLUE:4, RED:3, BLACK:3 (need 1, 1, 1, 2) ✓
- Gold token can cover any deficit

**Why PURCHASE L1_26:**
1. Gives GREEN:1 bonus - critical for N8 noble requirement (WHITE:3, GREEN:3, BLUE:3)
2. After this purchase: GREEN bonus increases from 1 to 2
3. Reduces tokens from 10 to 5, freeing space for next turn
4. L1_26 costs WHITE:1, which I'm abundant in (4 tokens + 3 bonus)
5. Green tokens are scarce on board (0 available) - getting them via cards is valuable

**Token Efficiency:**
- Before: 10 tokens → After: 5 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:0, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1)
- With 5 tokens, next turn I can take 3 tokens without exceeding limit

**Strategic Context:**
- My opponent has 6 points and is threatening to win
- I need to catch up by accumulating prestige points efficiently
- L1_26 gives a bonus toward N8 noble (3 pts), a high-value target
- After this purchase: WHITE:3 bonus ✓, GREEN:2 bonus, BLUE:3 bonus ✓ - getting close to N8!

**Why not take tokens?**
- Taking tokens when at 10 tokens limit is wasteful
- Board has WHITE:0, BLUE:0, GREEN:0 - only RED:2, BLACK:2 available
- Better to purchase and reduce token count productively

**Post-Purchase Bonuses:**
- WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2
- Working toward N8 noble (WHITE:3✓, GREEN:3, BLUE:3✓) - need 1 more GREEN bonus

Turn 28 - Player 0's move
Points: 6, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=5, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I have 5 tokens: BLUE 3, GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 1. Bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 2, GREEN 3, RED 3, BLACK 2. I can purchase L2_51 (cost BLUE 5). After BLUE bonus 2, I need 3 BLUE tokens. I have 3 BLUE tokens exactly, so I can purchase it now. This gives 2 prestige points (bringing me to 8) and a BLUE bonus (increasing BLUE to 3). This helps towards nobles N6 and N8, both requiring BLUE 3. The opponent has 0 prestige and many tokens, but they cannot purchase L2_51 because they lack BLUE tokens (they have 1 BLUE token, cost after BLUE bonus 3? Actually opponent's BLUE bonus is 3, so they need 2 BLUE tokens, but they have only 1 BLUE token and 1 GOLD, maybe they could use gold? But they would still need another blue token. Regardless, I should secure this high-value card now. Alternatives: L2_63 (cost GREEN 5) after GREEN bonus 3, I need 2 GREEN tokens. I have 2 GREEN tokens, so I could also purchase that, but it gives a GREEN bonus (I already have GREEN 3) and 2 prestige. However, purchasing L2_51 gives a BLUE bonus which is more critical for nobles. Also, L2_51 is more valuable because it uses my abundant BLUE tokens. Purchasing now reduces my token count to 2 (since I spend 3 BLUE tokens), leaving me with GREEN 2, RED 1, BLACK 1. That's 4 tokens total, allowing me to take tokens next turn. The board tokens are scarce: RED 2, BLACK 2, others 0. I can take RED and BLACK next turn to aim for L2_56 or other cards. I should prioritize scoring points. I also consider nobles: after purchasing L2_51, my bonuses become WHITE 2, BLUE 3, GREEN 3, RED 3, BLACK 2. Noble N6 requires WHITE 3, BLACK 3, BLUE 3 – I now have BLUE 3, need WHITE 1 and BLACK 1 more. Noble N8 requires WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3 – I have GREEN 3 and BLUE 3, need WHITE 1 more. So WHITE is the remaining bottleneck. Unfortunately, WHITE tokens are unavailable on board. I might need to purchase a WHITE-bonus card or wait for WHITE tokens to replenish. But for now, scoring points is key. I will purchase L2_51.

Turn 28 - Player 1's move
Points: 0, Budget: {WHT=7, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=3, GLD=1}
Reasoning: I'm at 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and need to purchase a card to reduce token count and work toward nobles.

**Card Affordability Check - L1_3:**
- Cost: WHITE:2, BLUE:2, RED:1
- My tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, RED:1
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, RED:2
- Total available: WHITE:7, BLUE:4, RED:3 (need 2, 2, 1) ✓

**Why PURCHASE L1_3:**
1. Gives BLACK:1 bonus - critical for N6 noble requirement (WHITE:3, BLACK:3, BLUE:3)
2. After this purchase: BLACK bonus goes from 2 to 3
3. Reduces tokens from 10 to 5, freeing space for next turn
4. Uses abundant tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1) efficiently
5. L1_3 is on board and affordable now

**Post-Purchase Bonuses:**
- WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:3
- N6 noble status: WHITE:3✓, BLACK:3✓, BLUE:3✓ → QUALIFIED!

**Strategic Context:**
- My opponent has 8 points and is far ahead
- I need to catch up by getting nobles and prestige cards
- With N6 now qualified, I just need to take a noble token (not an action, but happens when you visit)
- After this purchase, I'll take 2 BLACK + 1 BLUE tokens to reach 9 tokens
- Then I can "visit" N6 noble on a subsequent turn to get 3 prestige points

**Why not take tokens first?**
- Taking tokens while at 10 tokens is wasteful
- Board has WHITE:0, BLUE:3, GREEN:0, RED:2, BLACK:2 available
- Better to purchase and reduce token count productively

Turn 29 - Player 0's move
Points: 8, Budget: {WHT=2, BLU=3, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I currently have 8 prestige points and bonuses: WHITE 2, BLUE 3, GREEN 3, RED 3, BLACK 2. Purchasing L1_17 is free after applying bonuses (cost BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 1, BLACK 1; all reduced to 0 by my bonuses). This increases my WHITE bonus to 3, which meets the requirement for noble N8 (WHITE 3, GREEN 3, BLUE 3), granting me 3 additional prestige points immediately. This brings my total to 11 prestige efficiently in one turn. Alternative moves like taking tokens or purchasing other cards (e.g., L2_63 for 2 prestige) yield less immediate gain and delay the noble trigger. Since I have only 4 tokens, I don't risk exceeding the limit, and preserving tokens allows future purchases like L2_56 or L2_63 to reach 15 prestige quickly. Opponent has 3 prestige and many tokens but is not an immediate threat, so accelerating my score is paramount.

Turn 29 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=7, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=4, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 10 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:3. My score is 3. Opponent has 11 points and is threatening to win.

**Board Token Scarcity:**
- WHITE:0, GREEN:0 (completely depleted!)
- Available: BLUE:3, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:4

**Card Affordability Check - L1_4:**
- Cost: GREEN:1, RED:3, BLACK:1
- My tokens: GREEN:2, RED:1, BLACK:1
- Bonuses: GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:3
- Total available: GREEN:4, RED:3, BLACK:4 (need 1, 3, 1) ✓

**Why PURCHASE L1_4:**
1. Gives BLACK:1 bonus - my BLACK bonus increases from 3 to 4
2. Works toward N5 noble (RED:4, BLACK:4) - I need RED:4, BLACK:4
3. Uses tokens efficiently (10 → 6 tokens, freeing 4 slots)
4. Board has no WHITE or GREEN tokens available - taking tokens now is wasteful
5. L1_4 is affordable with my current bonuses

**Token Efficiency:**
- Before: 10 tokens → After: 6 tokens
- Frees up space for next turn to take RED tokens

**Strategic Context:**
- My opponent has 11 points and is far ahead
- I need to catch up by getting nobles (3 pts each)
- N5 noble requires RED:4, BLACK:4 - I have RED:2, BLACK:4 after purchase
- After this purchase, I'll take 2 RED + 1 BLACK tokens next turn (available on board)
- This gets me to RED:3, BLACK:5, working toward N5 noble qualification

**Why not take tokens first?**
- Taking tokens while at 10 tokens limit is wasteful
- Board has WHITE:0, GREEN:0 - only RED:2, BLACK:2 available
- Better to purchase and reduce token count productively

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1 = 6 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:4
- Ready to take 3 tokens next turn (targeting RED tokens for N5 progress)

Turn 30 - Player 0's move
Points: 11, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=5, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I am at 11 prestige and need 4 more to win. The most efficient move is to purchase L2_63, which gives 2 prestige immediately and uses my 2 GREEN tokens (after applying my GREEN bonus of 3, I need exactly 2 GREEN tokens). This brings me to 13 prestige. Next turn, I can take tokens to prepare for L2_56 (2 prestige) to reach 15 in three turns total. Alternatives like taking tokens now or buying L2_60 (only 1 prestige) would delay victory. The opponent has 3 prestige but a strong token set; I should not give them time to catch up. Purchasing L2_63 is the fastest path to increase my score now.

Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:4. My score is 3. Opponent has 13 points and is far ahead.

**Card Affordability Check - L1_37:**
- Cost: BLUE:2, GREEN:1
- My tokens: BLUE:1, GREEN:2
- Bonuses: BLUE:3, GREEN:2
- Total available: BLUE:4, GREEN:4 (need 2, 1) ✓

**Why PURCHASE L1_37:**
1. Gives RED:1 bonus - critical for N5 noble requirement (RED:4, BLACK:4)
   - After this purchase: RED bonus goes from 2 to 3
   - N5 requirement: RED:4, BLACK:4 - I have RED:3, BLACK:4 ✓
2. Token efficiency: 9 → 6 tokens (reduces by 3)
3. Works toward N5 noble - only need 1 more RED bonus to qualify!
4. L1_37 is on board and affordable with my current bonuses

**Token Efficiency:**
- Before: 9 tokens → After: 6 tokens
- Frees up space for next turn to take RED tokens

**Strategic Context:**
- Opponent has 13 points and is about to win
- I need to catch up by getting nobles (3 pts each)
- N5 noble requires RED:4, BLACK:4 - after this purchase: RED:3, BLACK:4
- Next turn: Take 2 RED + 1 RED (if available) to reach RED:5, BLACK:4 → QUALIFIED for N5!

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:0, GREEN:1, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 6 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:4

Turn 31 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=3, GRN=4, RED=4, BLK=3}
Reasoning: I need 2 more prestige points to win (currently at 13). My options: purchase L2_56 (2 prestige, cost RED 5, BLACK 3). After my bonuses: WHITE 3, BLUE 3, GREEN 4, RED 3, BLACK 2. So net cost: RED 5-3=2, BLACK 3-2=1. I need 2 RED tokens and 1 BLACK token. I currently have 0 tokens (after purchasing L2_63 last turn, I have RED 1, BLACK 1? Wait, check my tokens: according to the game state, my tokens are WHITE 0, BLUE 0, GREEN 0, RED 1, BLACK 1. That's 2 tokens total. So I have RED 1 and BLACK 1. To purchase L2_56, I need 2 RED and 1 BLACK, so I'm short 1 RED and 0 BLACK (since I have 1 BLACK already). So I need to acquire 1 RED token. I could take tokens: board has WHITE 0, BLUE 3, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 2. I have 2 tokens, so I can take up to 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I could take 1 RED, and then take 2 other colors to make 3 total. Taking BLUE and GREEN would be useful for other cards, but my immediate goal is L2_56. I could take RED, BLUE, and GREEN, which would give me RED 2, BLUE 1, GREEN 1, BLACK 1. Then I could purchase L2_56 next turn (needs RED 2, BLACK 1; I would have exactly that). That's a 2-turn plan: this turn take tokens, next turn purchase L2_56 for the win. Alternatively, I could purchase L2_60 (1 prestige) now? Cost: WHITE 2, BLUE 3, BLACK 2. After bonuses: WHITE 0 (bonus 3), BLUE 0 (bonus 3), BLACK 0 (bonus 2). So it's free! And I have 0 tokens needed. That would give me 1 prestige, bringing me to 14. Then I could take tokens or purchase another card next turn to get the final point. But L2_60 is a green bonus, which I don't particularly need, but it's free and gives a point. However, it uses no tokens, so I'd still have 2 tokens. Then I'd need 1 more point. I could purchase L1_24 (1 prestige) for cost GREEN 4, after GREEN bonus 4 = 0 cost? Wait, L1_24 cost is GREEN 4, I have GREEN bonus 4, so it's free too. But I need to check if I have any green tokens? No, I have 0 green tokens, but since cost after bonus is 0, I don't need tokens. So I could purchase L1_24 immediately after L2_60? No, I can only do one purchase per turn. So if I purchase L2_60 now, I get to 14. Next turn, I could purchase L1_24 for the final point. That's also a 2-turn win. But is there a faster way? I could purchase L2_56 directly if I had the tokens. Since I'm short 1 RED, I could take 2 RED tokens (same color) if there are at least 4 RED on board. There are 3 RED, so I can't take 2 RED. I must take 3 different colors or 2 same color if at least 4 available. So I can't take 2 RED. I could take 1 RED and 2 other colors. That's fine. So both plans take 2 turns. However, purchasing L2_60 now gives me a point immediately and doesn't change my token count, but it might allow the opponent to take tokens and maybe catch up. The opponent has 3 prestige and many tokens (WHITE 4, BLUE 1, GREEN 2, RED 0, BLACK 1, GOLD 1). They could potentially purchase a high-point card soon. I should aim to win as quickly as possible. Purchasing L2_60 now gets me to 14, and next turn I can win with L1_24. But is L1_24 still available? Yes, it's in the face-up cards. Alternatively, I could reserve a card to get a gold token? Not necessary. Actually, if I purchase L2_60 now, I still have 2 tokens, and next turn I could take tokens to afford something else, but L1_24 is free. So that seems safe. However, I need to consider if the opponent can win before my next turn. They have 3 prestige, so they need 12 more points, which is impossible in one turn. So I'm safe. Therefore, the fastest path is to purchase L2_60 now (1 prestige) and then next turn purchase L1_24 (1 prestige) for the win. That's two turns. Alternatively, if I take tokens now and purchase L2_56 next turn, that's also two turns. But purchasing L2_60 now gives me an extra point immediately, reducing the risk of the opponent doing something unexpected. Also, taking tokens might allow the opponent to take tokens or reserve cards, but they can't win in one turn anyway. So I think purchasing L2_60 is better because it advances my score now and uses no tokens. However, I should check if L2_60 is still available? Yes, it's in the face-up cards. So I will purchase L2_60.
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens=null, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 0. Error: Invalid action: Must select tokens to take.
Reasoning: I have 13 prestige, need 2 more to win. My current tokens: RED 1, BLACK 1 (total 2). I can afford to take 3 tokens without exceeding 10. I should collect tokens to purchase a card that gives 2+ prestige. Looking at affordable cards: L2_56 (2 prestige, cost RED 5, BLACK 3). After my bonuses (WHITE 3, BLUE 3, GREEN 4, RED 3, BLACK 2), I need RED tokens: 5 - 3 = 2, BLACK tokens: 3 - 2 = 1. I currently have RED 1, BLACK 1, so I need 1 more RED token. If I take 1 RED, 1 BLACK, and another color (maybe BLUE or GREEN), I can purchase L2_56 next turn. However, L2_56 gives WHITE bonus which I don't need, but 2 prestige gets me to 15. Alternatively, L2_62 (2 prestige, cost BLUE 5, GREEN 3) after bonuses: BLUE 5 - 3 = 2 BLUE tokens needed, GREEN 3 - 4 = 0 GREEN tokens needed. I have 0 BLUE tokens, so need 2 BLUE. Could take BLUE and GREEN and something else. But board tokens: WHITE 0, BLUE 3, GREEN 2, RED 3, BLACK 2. I can take BLUE, GREEN, RED for example. That would give me BLUE 1, GREEN 1, RED 2, BLACK 1 after taking, total 5 tokens. Then L2_62 would require 2 BLUE tokens, I'd have 1, so need another BLUE next turn. That's slower. L2_60 (1 prestige) is less efficient. L1_24 (1 prestige, cost GREEN 4) after GREEN bonus 4 needs 0 GREEN tokens, so free purchase, but only 1 prestige. That gets me to 14, then need 1 more. Could be okay if I can get another 1 prestige card. But I should aim for 2 prestige to win immediately next turn. So L2_56 is the best target. I need 1 more RED token. So I can take RED, BLACK, and a third color. Since I have 2 tokens now, taking 3 gives 5 total, no need to return. I'll take RED, BLACK, and BLUE (since BLUE might be useful for other cards). Board has RED 3, BLACK 2, BLUE 3, so all available. After taking, I'll have RED 2, BLACK 2, BLUE 1. Then next turn I can purchase L2_56 (need RED 2, BLACK 1) exactly, giving 2 prestige and winning. This is the fastest path. No need to reserve or purchase now.

Turn 31 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=7, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=3, BLK=5, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:4. My score is 3. Opponent has 13 points and is far ahead.

**N5 Noble Qualification:**
- N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4 → I have RED:3, BLACK:4 ✓
- Need 1 more RED bonus to QUALIFY for N5 (3 prestige points)

**Card Analysis - L1_30:**
- Bonus: RED
- Cost: BLUE:2, RED:2
- My tokens: BLUE:1, RED:0
- Bonuses: BLUE:3, RED:3
- Total available: BLUE:4, RED:3 (need 2, 2) ✓

**Why PURCHASE L1_30:**
1. Gives RED:1 bonus → RED goes from 3 to 4 → QUALIFIED for N5!
2. Token efficiency: 9 → 7 tokens (reduces by 2)
3. Works toward N5 noble (RED:4✓, BLACK:4✓) - after purchase, I'll have exactly what I need!
4. L1_30 is on board and affordable with my current bonuses

**Post-Purchase State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1 = 7 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:4
- **QUALIFIED for N5 noble!**

**Next Turn Strategy:**
- Take 2 RED + 1 RED tokens (3 total) to reach 10 tokens
- Then on subsequent turn, "visit" N5 noble to collect 3 prestige points
- This will bring my score from 3 to 6, getting closer to opponent's 13

**Why not take tokens now?**
- Taking tokens now (before purchasing) would exceed 10 token limit
- Better to purchase first (reduces to 7), then take tokens next turn
- Board has RED:2 available, which is perfect for my needs
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L1_30]

Turn 32 - Player 0's move
Points: 13, Budget: {WHT=3, BLU=4, GRN=4, RED=5, BLK=4}
Reasoning: I am at 13 prestige, need 2 to win. My tokens: RED 2, BLACK 2, BLUE 1 (total 5). My bonuses: WHITE 3, BLUE 3, GREEN 4, RED 3, BLACK 2. I can purchase L2_56 (cost RED 5, BLACK 3). After bonuses: RED cost 5 - 3 = 2, BLACK cost 3 - 2 = 1. I have exactly RED 2 and BLACK 1 tokens, so I can purchase it now. This gives 2 prestige, bringing my total to 15 and winning the game immediately. No need to take tokens or reserve. The opponent cannot interrupt because it's my turn. I must verify the card exists in face-up cards: yes, L2_56 is listed under LEVEL_2. Therefore, purchase L2_56.
Action: PurchaseCardAction[cardId=L2_56]

Turn 32 - Player 1's move
Points: 3, Budget: {WHT=7, BLU=4, GRN=5, RED=3, BLK=5, GLD=1}
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 7 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:4. My score is 3. Opponent has 15 points and has already won the game!

**N5 Noble Qualification Status:**
- N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4 → I have RED:3, BLACK:4 ✓
- I need 1 more RED bonus to qualify for N5 (3 prestige points)
- I'm also qualified for N8 (WHITE:3✓, GREEN:3, BLUE:3✓) - need 1 more GREEN bonus

**Token Strategy:**
- Current tokens: 7 (under limit of 10)
- Taking 2 RED + 1 BLACK = 3 tokens
- New token total: 7 + 3 = 10 tokens

**Why TAKE TOKENS (not purchase):**
1. No affordable prestige cards available
   - L1_24 costs GREEN:4 (I have only 2 GREEN tokens + 2 bonus = 4, but GREEN tokens scarce on board)
   - All L2/L3 cards require 5+ tokens of a color, which I don't have
2. Taking tokens works toward N5 qualification
   - N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4 → after this: RED:5, BLACK:5 ✓
3. With 10 tokens, next turn I can purchase a card OR visit N5 noble
   - If I visit N5 next turn: +3 points, bringing score to 6
   - Still far from winning, but maximizes my points

**Board Analysis:**
- Available: WHITE:0, BLUE:2, GREEN:2, RED:4, BLACK:2, GOLD:4
- Taking 2 RED (available) and 1 BLACK (available) is valid

**Post-Action State:**
- Tokens: WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:2, BLACK:2, GOLD:1 = 10 tokens
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:2, RED:3, BLACK:4
- QUALIFIED for N5 noble! Next turn I can visit N5 for +3 points.

**Why not reserve a card?**
- No gold tokens needed for my current targets
- Taking tokens is more direct toward my goal
Action: TakeTokensAction[tokens={RED=2, BLACK=1}, tokensToReturn=null]
Retry attempt 1 for Player 1. Error: Invalid action: For taking 3 tokens, they must be of 3 different colors.
Reasoning: **Current Position Analysis:**
I'm player 1 with 9 tokens (WHITE:4, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:1, GOLD:1) and bonuses WHITE:3, BLUE:3, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:4. My score is 3. Opponent has 15 points and has already won.

**N5 Noble Qualification:**
- N5 requires RED:4, BLACK:4 → I have RED:3, BLACK:4 ✓
- Need 1 more RED bonus to QUALIFY for N5 (3 prestige points)

**Card Analysis - L1_13:**
- Bonus: BLUE
- Cost: WHITE:1, BLACK:2
- My tokens: WHITE:4, BLACK:1
- Bonuses: WHITE:3, BLACK:4
- Total available: WHITE:7, BLACK:5 (need 1, 2) ✓

**Why PURCHASE L1_13:**
1. Gives BLUE:1 bonus → BLUE goes from 3 to 4
2. Works toward my deck-building strategy
3. Token efficiency: 9 → 6 tokens (reduces by 3)
4. L1_13 is on board and affordable with my current bonuses
5. Uses abundant WHITE tokens (4 available) and BLACK tokens (1 token + 4 bonus)

**Token Efficiency:**
- Before: 9 tokens → After: 6 tokens (WHITE:3, BLUE:1, GREEN:2, RED:0, BLACK:0, GOLD:1)
- Frees up space for next turn to take 3 tokens

**Post-Purchase Bonuses:**
- WHITE:3, BLUE:4, GREEN:3, RED:3, BLACK:4
- Ready to build toward future purchases and nobles

**Why not take tokens?**
- With only 9 tokens, I have room to take 1 token, but purchasing is more efficient
- Purchasing reduces token count and builds my engine
- L1_13 costs WHITE:1, BLACK:2 which I can easily afford
