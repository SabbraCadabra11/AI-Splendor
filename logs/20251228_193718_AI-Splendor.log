2025-12-28 19:38:42.004 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: On turn 1, I need to establish a productive token-gathering strategy. Analyzing the card pool, I identify several key strategic paths:

1. The BLUE bottleneck: Only L1_14 provides a BLUE bonus (costs GREEN:2, BLACK:2). Since L3_86 is the premium card (5 prestige for BLUE:7, GREEN:3), securing the BLUE bonus early is critical for scaling.

2. GREEN versatility: GREEN appears in nearly all valuable cards (L2_44, L2_61, L2_63, L3_88, L3_86) and in all three nobles. Accumulating GREEN tokens early provides flexibility.

3. Efficient early purchase: L1_14 is relatively cheap and unlocks the BLUE engine. Getting it by turn 3 is achievable with focused token gathering.

My strategy:
- Turn 1: Take GREEN:1, BLACK:2 (building toward L1_14)
- Turn 2-3: Gather remaining tokens and purchase L1_14, securing BLUE bonus
- Turns 4+: Use BLUE bonus to scale toward expensive BLUE/GREEN cards and high prestige cards

This is more efficient than a fully balanced approach because it commits to the highest-value prestige card (L3_86) while maintaining flexibility with GREEN tokens.

I'm not reserving a card yet since I have no resources to leverage a gold token effectively on turn 1—gathering tokens is the priority.

I prioritize GREEN, BLUE, and RED based on card requirements:

1. **GREEN** is the most versatile gem:
   - L3_88: 4 prestige points, needs 7 GREEN
   - L3_86: 5 prestige points (highest!), needs 3 GREEN
   - L2_63, L2_44: Also require GREEN
   - Three nobles (N8, N4, N7) require GREEN bonuses

2. **BLUE** is critical for the highest-value card:
   - L3_86: 5 prestige (needs 7 BLUE) - this is the best single card available
   - L3_87, L2_61: Also need BLUE

3. **RED** supports strong mid-tier cards:
   - L3_72: 4 prestige points (needs 7 RED)
   - L2_44: 2 prestige (needs 3 RED)
   - N7 noble requires RED

All three colors have 4+ tokens available on the board, so this is a valid TAKE_TOKENS action with 3 different colors (1 each). This gives me 3 total tokens, well under the 10-token limit, with no returns needed.

I need to establish token flexibility to pursue multiple strategic paths. The opponent took BLUE, GREEN, RED, suggesting they may pursue Noble N7 (requires 3 BLACK, 3 RED, 3 GREEN bonuses). I should differentiate my strategy while keeping options open. Taking WHITE, GREEN, BLACK tokens provides: (1) WHITE and BLACK are abundant on board (4 each), (2) GREEN is universally needed for efficient Level 1 cards like L1_24 (4 GREEN cost, 1 point + WHITE bonus), (3) These colors set me up for multiple Level 1 purchase options next turn (L1_14 needs 2 GREEN + 2 BLACK, L1_35 needs 2 WHITE + 1 GREEN + 2 BLACK, L1_21 needs 2 RED + 1 BLACK), (4) Positions me toward Noble N8 (3 WHITE, 3 BLUE, 3 GREEN bonuses) by diversifying from opponent's tokens. This balanced approach avoids over-committing to a single strategy while maximizing early-game flexibility. After this move, I'll have 3 tokens total (within the 10 limit), positioning me to either take more tokens or make an early card purchase on turn 3.

2025-12-28 19:41:48.205 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 2 decision point: After my opening token accumulation (BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1), I need to decide between continuing to gather tokens or making a strategic reserve. Analysis strongly favors reserving L3_86 immediately.

**Why L3_86 is the critical card:**
- It offers the highest prestige value on the board: 5 prestige points
- All other level-3 cards offer only 4 prestige (L3_88, L3_72) or 3 prestige (L3_87)
- This is the single most efficient source of prestige visible

**Strategic benefits of reserving now:**
1. **Preemptive blocking**: My opponent will also recognize L3_86 as the best card. If I don't reserve it, they almost certainly will on their turn 2, giving them the gold token + secured pathway advantage.
2. **Gold token advantage**: Reserving grants me 1 gold token (wildcard), which is disproportionately valuable—it can substitute for any gem color in future purchases.
3. **Secured commitment**: Once reserved, the card is mine unless I deliberately abandon it. I have time over the next 3-5 turns to accumulate BLUE=7 and GREEN=3 (aided by bonuses from intermediate cards).
4. **Tempo control**: I signal my strategic direction and lock in the optimal prestige path before my opponent can.

**Why not take tokens instead:**
- Token gathering will always be available in future turns; the reserve window is now
- If opponent reserves L3_86, I'm forced into suboptimal card chains (L3_88 or L3_72, each costing 7 of one resource for only 4 prestige)
- A secured high-value card + gold token > 2-3 additional gemstone tokens
- I retain full flexibility with my current 3 tokens; reserving doesn't lock my immediate options

**Path forward after this move:**
- Tokens: BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=1 (4 total, under limit)
- Reserved: L3_86
- Next turns: Accumulate BLUE and GREEN tokens, potentially buy intermediate cards with GREEN bonuses (like L2_61) to reduce L3_86's cost
- This secures my first major prestige accumulation safely

Conclusion: Reserve L3_86 to immediately claim the highest-value card and prevent opponent advantage.

Taking WHITE, GREEN, BLACK tokens gives me WHITE=2, GREEN=2, BLACK=2 (6 tokens total), enabling two purchase options next turn: (1) L1_14 (costs GREEN=2, BLACK=2) for the scarce BLUE bonus, directly advancing N8 and enabling efficient Level 2 purchases like L2_61 (needs BLUE=2), OR (2) L1_35 (costs WHITE=2, GREEN=1, BLACK=2) for a RED bonus if the board state changes. After buying L1_14, I retain WHITE=2 for future WHITE-based cards (L1_21, L1_24, L2_45), maintaining strategic flexibility. This move prioritizes immediate progress (first bonus next turn) while positioning toward N8, as my opponent likely needs 3-4 more turns to afford their expensive reserved card.

2025-12-28 19:45:32.820 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 3 strategic decision: Having secured L3_86 (5 prestige—the highest-value card on the board) via reservation, I now face a critical resource bottleneck. L3_86 requires BLUE=7 and GREEN=3, but only 1 GREEN token remains on the board—physical GREEN tokens are essentially exhausted. Relying solely on tokens is impossible; I MUST acquire GREEN bonuses through purchased cards.

L2_61 is the key bottleneck: It provides a GREEN bonus (along with 2 prestige) and costs WHITE=4, BLUE=2, BLACK=1. Without L2_61, I cannot efficiently gather GREEN=3 to afford L3_86. Moreover, my opponent will recognize this same constraint and will almost certainly reserve L2_61 on their next turn, completely blocking my strategic path.

Reserving L2_61 NOW accomplishes four critical goals:
1. **Locks the bottleneck card**: Guarantees my access to the GREEN-bonus source I must have.
2. **Secures a second gold token**: Brings me to GOLD=2 (both are valuable wildcards for mid-game flexibility).
3. **Denies opponent interference**: Prevents them from blocking my strategy with the same reservation.
4. **Preserves future flexibility**: Token accumulation can resume every subsequent turn while I maintain a guaranteed path forward.

The individual GREEN token on the board is less critical than the strategic card itself, because I can still generate GREEN cost-reductions through bonuses. However, L2_61 is non-negotiable—it's the only path to make L3_86 affordable. This reservation window is now or never.

After this action: Reserved cards are L3_86 + L2_61, tokens remain BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=2.

Opponent reserved expensive GREEN cards (L3_86: BLUE=7+GREEN=3, L2_61: WHITE=4+BLUE=2+BLACK=1), indicating multi-turn token accumulation. I must execute my L1_14 purchase plan NOW. Card verification: L1_14 appears under board.faceUpCards.LEVEL_1, costs GREEN=2+BLACK=2 exactly matching my holdings. Token calculation: Spending GREEN=2+BLACK=2 leaves WHITE=2, gaining BLUE bonus. This move: (1) Establishes first bonus (BLUE=1), enabling cheaper BLUE-cost purchases, (2) Progresses Noble N8 path (needs WHITE=3+BLUE=3+GREEN=3), (3) Returns tokens to board (GREEN+2, BLACK+2), improving supply for next turn. Strategic impact: Opponent needs 4-6 turns minimum to afford reserved cards while I can pivot to L1_21 (RED=2+BLACK=1, WHITE bonus) in 2 turns after collecting RED tokens, or pursue L1_24 (GREEN=4, WHITE bonus+1pt) if GREEN replenishes. Tempo advantage critical: bonuses compound, early engine dominates late-game point racing.

2025-12-28 19:48:28.533 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm at Turn 4 with a clear two-card strategic path locked in: L3_86 (5 prestige) and L2_61 (2 prestige). However, I'm hitting a resource bottleneck.

Current state: BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, GOLD=2 (total 5 tokens), score 0 prestige, opponent very weak (only 2 tokens, no reserves).

My challenge: L3_86 requires BLUE=7 and GREEN=3, but the board only has limited loose tokens (BLUE=3, GREEN=3 max). I cannot accumulate enough through tokens alone—I MUST acquire gem bonuses to reduce costs and effectively increase purchasing power.

Key insight: **L1_30 is the critical bottleneck card** (not L2_61 as initially thought):
- L1_30 costs only BLUE=2, RED=2 (very affordable)
- Provides GREEN bonus, reducing L3_86's effective GREEN requirement from 3 to 2
- This is the cheapest GREEN bonus in the game
- I can afford it immediately after this turn's token accumulation

Once I have L1_30's GREEN bonus, the math becomes tractable:
- L3_86 with GREEN bonus costs: BLUE=7, GREEN=2 (instead of 3)
- This saves 1 GREEN gem, which is huge given board scarcity

Optimal action: Take 3 different tokens to position myself for L1_30 purchase on Turn 5:
- **WHITE**: Needed for L2_61 later; board has 2, taking 1 leaves 1
- **RED**: I need RED=2 to afford L1_30 (costs RED=2, BLUE=2); taking 1 gives me RED=2 total
- **BLACK**: Supports L2_61 and future flexibility

After this action:
- Tokens: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=2 (total 8)
- Board: WHITE=1, BLUE=3, GREEN=3, RED=2, BLACK=3, GOLD=3
- On Turn 5: I can purchase L1_30 (costs BLUE=2, RED=2) because I'll have BLUE=1 + take 1 = 2, and RED=2 already
- After L1_30: I gain GREEN bonus, turning L3_86 into a realistic 3-4 turn goal

Token total: 5 current + 3 taken = 8 ≤ 10 limit (no returns needed).

2025-12-28 19:51:50.464 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 4 strategic pivot. Current: WHITE=2 tokens, BLUE=1 bonus. Opponent: 8 tokens, reserved expensive cards (L3_86 needs BLUE=7+GREEN=3, L2_61 needs WHITE=4+BLUE=2+BLACK=1), earliest purchase 2+ turns away. Critical noble analysis reveals N8 (WHITE=3, BLUE=3, GREEN=3) is unachievable - BLUE bonuses require only L3_77 at WHITE=6+BLUE=3+BLACK=3 (prohibitively expensive). N7 (BLACK=3, RED=3, GREEN=3) has abundant options: RED via L1_35/L3_88/L3_87, GREEN via L1_30/L2_63, BLACK via L2_44/L2_45/L2_43/L3_72. Decision: Pivot to N7. First target L1_35 (RED bonus, costs WHITE=2+GREEN=1+BLACK=2) - I have WHITE=2, need GREEN=1+BLACK=2. Taking GREEN=1, BLACK=1, RED=1 provides: (1) Tokens become WHITE=2, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1 (5 total, valid), (2) Turn 5: Collect BLACK=1 more via 3-color take, purchase L1_35 (RED bonus), (3) Turn 6: Purchase L1_30 (GREEN bonus, effective cost BLUE=1+RED=2 using my BLUE=1 bonus), (4) RED token collected now serves dual purpose - enables L1_30 and future L2_43 (BLACK bonus, effective cost GREEN=4+RED=2). This path builds toward N7 efficiently while maintaining 2-turn tempo advantage over opponent. Board verification: GREEN=3, BLACK=3, RED=2 available, all sufficient for 1-token takes.

2025-12-28 19:52:32.601 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 5 critical decision: I currently have WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=2 (8 tokens total). My strategic path is locked: L3_86 (5 prestige) + L2_61 (2 prestige). The immediate bottleneck is acquiring the GREEN bonus from L1_30 to reduce L3_86's effective cost.

**KEY INSIGHT: I can afford L1_30 RIGHT NOW using gold as a wildcard!**
- L1_30 costs: BLUE=2, RED=2
- I have: BLUE=1, RED=2, GOLD=2
- I use 1 GOLD to substitute for the missing 1 BLUE
- Complete purchase is valid

**Why purchase L1_30 now instead of taking tokens:**

1. **Gold efficiency**: Using 1 gold token (rarest currency) to secure a permanent GREEN bonus is an exceptional trade. This is far more valuable than the equivalent gemstone tokens.

2. **Token capacity optimization**: I'm at 8/10 tokens. Purchasing now frees capacity to 4 tokens rather than pushing toward the 10-token limit and requiring token returns.

3. **Solves the GREEN bottleneck**: L3_86 requires GREEN=3 without bonuses, but only 2 GREEN tokens exist on the board. With L1_30's GREEN bonus, I need GREEN=2. This single bonus saves me 1 precious green resource—game-changing given scarcity.

4. **Unlocks next phase**: After securing this bonus, I can immediately begin accumulating resources for L2_61 (which also provides GREEN). With two GREEN bonuses stacked, L3_86 becomes genuinely purchasable.

5. **Tempo dominance**: Opponent has 5 tokens, 1 purchased card, no reserves. They're significantly behind. Securing bonuses now widens the gap decisively.

**After this purchase:**
- Tokens: WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (4 total, maximum flexibility)
- Bonuses: GREEN=1 (from L1_30)
- Score: 0 prestige (but setup for explosive growth)
- Next target: Accumulate tokens for L2_61 (WHITE=4, BLUE=2, BLACK=1)

This is the exact move my Turn 4 reasoning predicted. Executing on schedule.

2025-12-28 19:55:17.287 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Current position: After Turn 5, I have WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (4 tokens total, well under 10 limit). I hold a GREEN bonus (+1 from L1_30) and have locked in two strategic reservations: L3_86 (5 prestige—highest on board) and L2_61 (2 prestige, provides another GREEN bonus). My score remains 0, but I'm positioned for rapid prestige acceleration once I accumulate critical resources.

The critical bottleneck is BLUE token scarcity. My locked path requires:
- L3_86: BLUE=7, GREEN=3 (reduced to GREEN=2 with my bonus)
- L2_61: WHITE=4, BLUE=2, BLACK=1
- Total BLUE needed: 9
- Board BLUE available: 3 (extremely limited)

Other scarce resources:
- WHITE: Need 4, board has only 1 available (taking it now prevents board loss)
- RED: Useful for building WHITE bonus via L1_21 (costs RED=2, BLACK=1)

Optimal action: TAKE_TOKENS to accumulate scarcest resources without exceeding token capacity.

Taking WHITE=1, BLUE=1, RED=1 is valid (3 different colors, 1 each):
- Board has: WHITE=1 ✓, BLUE=3 ✓, RED=2 ✓
- After action: tokens become WHITE=2, BLUE=1, RED=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (total 7)
- Board after: WHITE=0, BLUE=2, GREEN=2, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=4
- No returns needed (7 ≤ 10)
- Secures the only WHITE token before it vanishes
- Preserves path flexibility while positioning for intermediate card purchases

Next steps visible: With RED=1 after this turn, I'll be closer to affording L1_21 (which provides WHITE bonus, cost RED=2, BLACK=1) to unlock further cost reductions on L2_61.

2025-12-28 19:55:57.481 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: Turn 6: Executing my L1_35 purchase as planned. Current tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=2 (8 total), BLUE=1 bonus. Card verification: L1_35 exists on board under LEVEL_1, costs WHITE=2+GREEN=1+BLACK=2 exactly matching my holdings. This purchase: (1) Gives RED bonus (1/3 toward N7 which needs BLACK=3, RED=3, GREEN=3), (2) Costs 0 points but establishes critical bonus for future efficiency, (3) Retains RED=2+BLUE=1 tokens (3 total) for next phase. Post-purchase bonuses: BLUE=1+RED=1. Strategic path: Turn 7-8 accumulate GREEN tokens (need GREEN=4 total for either L1_24 which gives WHITE bonus+1pt, or save for L2_63 which gives GREEN bonus+2pts, or L2_43 which gives BLACK bonus+2pts with effective cost GREEN=4+RED=2 after my bonuses). Opponent at 7 tokens still cannot afford L2_61 (needs WHITE=4+BLUE=2+BLACK=1, effective WHITE=4+BLACK=1 using their GREEN=1 bonus, requires 2 more tokens minimum). My tempo advantage compounds: second bonus acquired while opponent still on first bonus. L1_35 executes my turn 5 plan.

2025-12-28 19:57:38.954 [com.aisplendor.App.main()] INFO  com.aisplendor.engine.GameSimulator - Reasoning: I'm at Turn 7 with 7 tokens and a locked strategic path: L3_86 (5 prestige—highest on board) + L2_61 (2 prestige). Both cards are reserved and will enable my prestige acceleration.

Current Position Analysis:
- My tokens: WHITE=2, BLUE=1, GREEN=1, RED=1, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (total 7, well under 10-cap)
- My bonuses: GREEN=1 (from L1_30)
- My sequence: Next I buy L1_21 for WHITE bonus, then L2_61 for second GREEN bonus, then L3_86

Critical Bottleneck Resources:
My locked path requires: L3_86 (BLUE=7, GREEN=3) + L2_61 (WHITE=4, BLUE=2, BLACK=1). Even with bonuses reducing costs:
- WHITE: Need 4 (for L2_61), board only has 1 remaining after token draws—must take 1 NOW
- RED: Need 2 (for L1_21 purchase next turn), board only has 1 left—must secure both NOW  
- BLUE: Long-term critical (7 needed for L3_86), board has 2 visible

Optimal Token Take (3 different colors):
- WHITE=1: Taking the only available ensures L2_61 affordability path
- BLUE=1: Incremental accumulation toward L3_86's BLUE=7 requirement
- RED=1: Completes RED=2 needed for L1_21 purchase next turn (I have RED=1 currently)

Validation:
- Current: 7 tokens, taking 3 = 10 total (at cap, no returns needed)
- Board supply: WHITE=2 ✓, BLUE=2 ✓, RED=1 ✓ (all available)
- Result: WHITE=3, BLUE=2, GREEN=1, RED=2, BLACK=1, GOLD=1 (token=10, bonuses stay at GREEN=1)

Strategic Advantages:
1. **Secures scarcest resources NOW**: After this take, WHITE=0 on board and RED=0. If I delay, opponent or board refresh makes these unavailable.
2. **Enables immediate next-turn purchase**: L1_21 (costs RED=2, BLACK=1) becomes buyable without GOLD waste.
3. **Preserves GOLD flexibility**: I retain my wildcard token for mid-game surprises or cost-coverage later.
4. **Defensive**: Taking RED=1 prevents opponent from accessing red tokens, disrupting their RED-card strategy (they're building toward L3_72/L3_88).
5. **Reaches token cap efficiently**: I'm at 10/10, forcing a purchase next turn, which keeps my strategy on pace and prevents token waste.

Next Turn Sequence:
- Turn 8: Buy L1_21 (RED=2, BLACK=1) → Gain WHITE bonus
- Turn 9: Accumulate tokens (BLUE, BLACK, GREEN)
- Turn 10: Buy L2_61 (WHITE=3, BLUE=2, BLACK=1 with WHITE bonus) → Gain second GREEN bonus  
- Turns 11+: Accumulate BLUE tokens (need BLUE=7 for L3_86, reduced to BLUE=2 GREEN cost with two bonuses)
- Final: Buy L3_86 for 5 prestige points

This move is on schedule from my Turn 6 reasoning and directly executes the planned accumulation phase.

Opponent at 10 tokens (max capacity) with GREEN=1 bonus can purchase reserved L2_61 next turn (costs WHITE=4+BLUE=2+BLACK=1, effective WHITE=4+BLUE=1+BLACK=1 after GREEN bonus, using GOLD=1 for missing WHITE) scoring 2pts and gaining second GREEN bonus. I'm trailing but pursuing efficient L2_43 path (BLACK bonus, 2pts, effective cost GREEN=4+RED=1 after my bonuses). Critical need: GREEN=4 total, currently GREEN=0. Board: WHITE=1, BLUE=1, GREEN=3, RED=0, BLACK=3 available. Taking WHITE=1+GREEN=1+BLACK=1 (valid 3 different colors): (1) Start GREEN collection (need 4 turns to reach GREEN=4), (2) WHITE+BLACK provide flexibility (L1_21 needs BLACK=1 if pivot needed, L1_11 needs WHITE=1+GREEN=2), (3) Post-take: BLUE=1, RED=2, WHITE=1, GREEN=1, BLACK=1 = 6 tokens (within 10 limit). Strategic path: Turns 8-10 continue taking GREEN=1/turn, reaching GREEN=4 by turn 10-11, purchase L2_43 for 2pts+BLACK bonus progressing N7 (need BLACK=3+RED=3+GREEN=3). RED=0 on board acceptable since I have RED=2 already (L2_43 needs RED=1). Accept temporary 0-2 score deficit while building toward sustainable noble race position.
